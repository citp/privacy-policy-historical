#### Does 6pm.com share the information it receives?

The following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed: 

**Fulfillment**  
During the purchase process, we will share your information with certain intermediaries (e.g. UPS, FedEx, Paymentech, Product Manufacturers) strictly to process and ship your order. 

**Promotional Offers**  
At times we may present or send offers to select 6pm.com subscribers on behalf of other parties. When we do this, we do not give that company your personally identifiable information without your consent. If you do not want to receive such communications, please edit your account preferences. 

**Agents**  
We employ other third parties to perform services or functions on our behalf in order to improve our site, merchandising, marketing and promotional efforts, communications or other services. Those third parties include authorized contractors, consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents"). They only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and may not share any personal information with others or use it for any other purpose than improving 6pm.com services and offerings. If you have made a purchase on the 6pm.com website, we may make your name and postal address available to carefully screened companies who have specific direct mail (e.g. catalog) product or service offers that we think may be of interest to you and whose privacy practices meet the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards. We only share with these carefully screened companies the individual names and postal address of customers who have purchased products from us. If you do not want us to share your name and postal address information, simply follow the instructions in the section below titled "Accessing and Updating Your Information." We may also receive information about you from other sources (such as demographic information and purchase history) and add it to our information in order to make our marketing efforts more efficient. 

**Advertisers**  
We work with third party advertising companies to serve and track our ads. These third parties may serve other cookies. Our advertising partners use the anonymous, non-personally identifying information they collect from our site, in the aggregate, to help us better market and serve our customers. In the event that our advertisers collect any personal information on our behalf, it will not be used by them or disclosed to any third parties. 

**Third Party Sites**  
You may visit other web sites, through links on our site, who may collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. The information practices of those websites linking from or to our site are not covered by this Policy, and we encourage you to be very cautious before you disclose your personal information to others. If you register for 6pm.com on another web site or use a web site providing a service for 6pm.com, that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions back to 6pm.com. It is possible that 6pm.com could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such an event occur, you should expect that 6pm.com would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide such products and services. Notice of such an event will be posted and we will require that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy. Where appropriate, before disclosing your personally identifiable information to a third party, we contractually require the third party to take adequate precautions to protect that data and to comply with applicable law. 

**Sharing Within Our Group**  
In order to provide you with the information, products, or services which you have requested, we may share or transfer your information with other companies within the eBags group of companies. In addition, we may also share your information with other companies within the eBags group who may contact you about their products or services that may interest you.

#### Accessing and Updating Your Information

You always have the opportunity to review and change the information you provide to us by logging into the site and entering in the new information yourself. You can edit your name, contact information and preferences by logging into the Your Account section of the site. 

As a customer, subscriber, or contest entrant, you will occasionally receive e-mail communications about new 6pm.com products, special offers we think you'll like and requests for feedback. If you want to stop receiving our emails or to specify the communications you prefer to receive, you may unsubscribe or edit your profile at any time. You can do this through any of our emails, by visiting your account preferences page or sending us an email at help@6pm.com. 

You may ask to have your account information removed from our active databases; however, because we keep track of past purchases, we cannot delete information associated with your past purchases. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity. Also, as a security measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, please be aware that we keep your personally identifiable information only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.  

#### Security

The 6pm.com Security Pledge protects you while you shop at 6pm.com so that you never have to worry about credit card safety. We guarantee that every transaction you make at 6pm.com will be safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your credit card as a result of shopping at 6pm.com. 6pm.com' servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and AOL's browser, so that only 6pm.com can read a buyer's personal information.

However, we will transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
