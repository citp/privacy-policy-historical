Members will always have the option to opt-out of these surveys. 

Who is collecting the information?  
All data collection and storage is done by the in-house professional staff at 6FigureJobs. We do not outsource any of our information gathering, regarding our membership base. If you visit any of the co-branded pages of the site and execute a financial transaction or submit additional information, be aware that our co-branded partner will be collecting this data. This individual transactional data is not retrieved, reviewed or retained by 6FigureJobs for any reason. Additionally, you should review the privacy policies of any of our co-branded partners before you release any information to them, if you desire. 

How is your information used?  
The primary function of the information gathered is to facilitate fast and efficient job searches, candidate searches and job matches among our user base. Secondarily, we utilize this information in the aggregate to build coherent user profiles, identify trends and priorities within the database, and identify areas of further growth or opportunity for the site. 

With whom is your information shared?  
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this website. We will not sell, rent or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third party, without your consent except in the following circumstances: 

Our aggregated site information (total registered users, page views, visitors, percentage breakdown of categories such as titles, industries, etc.) is made available to marketers or partners interested in advertising appropriate products or services to our membership. 

We will disclose your personal information to any appropriate investigative third party if we believe that you are involved in any illegal or harmful conduct, if we are required to do so by law, if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law or with legal process, to protect and defend our rights and property or that or our customers, to prevent fraud, to protect against abuse, misuse or unauthorized use of our website or to protect the personal safety of property of our customers or the public. 

We may have other companies provide services for us. These companies have access to the personal information needed to perform their functions and not for any other purposes. They are bound by confidentiality agreements not to disclose any information for any other purpose. 

What are your choices regarding use of your information?  
All users select their own level of confidentiality regarding their personal data, ranging from full confidentiality to full access. There is a minimum level of information required to facilitate job searches and job matches, as noted on the registration forms. Those who choose full access will have their resume and information entered into the fully searchable database. Those who choose full confidentiality will not have their information or resume posted or disseminated in any way. 

Any secondary communications or requests for additional information will be "opt-in". for all registered users. Any such communications will be distributed only to members who choose to receive our newsletter, event notifications, auto email job alerts and featured special offers and can be eliminated at any time by logging into your account and reversing your original selection of "yes" to "no" for any and all of the categories. 

How are "cookies" used on our site?  
A "cookie" is a small piece of information that a website can store in a designated file on your computer. It can be used, among other things, to identify you when you log in to a website.

Our advertisers may also place cookies in your browser to track advertising traffic and behavior, and these cookies are not controlled or accessed by 6FigureJobs at any time. Cookies are not used by 6FigureJobs to track individual usage of the site or to build individual profiles of users. Cookies from 6FigureJobs or from third party advertisers can be disabled at any time, by any user, through the "disable cookies" function on their personal browser.

How do you use the "Tell a Colleague" information?  
This feature allows you to email a friend or colleague about our service if you feel it would be of interest or value to them.
