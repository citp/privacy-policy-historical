# Privacy Policy from Six Seconds

Six Seconds will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent, expect as required by law to authorized law enforcement officials. We do not sell mailing lists or email address.

The information you provide for your personal Six Seconds Account is shared among the Six Seconds sites, and used internally to improve our services.

Six Seconds shares cumulative information about users such as the numbers of educators, trainers, or families seeking information about emotional intelligence -- but your individual and personal information is not identifyable in any way in these reports.

When you register for a Six Seconds Profile, for online shopping or transactions, or for services that require registration or subscription, we will ask for personal information such as your address, credit card information, and phone number. In case you change your mind or some personal information changes (such as your ZIP code), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update, or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this at the Edit Profile page us at staff@6seconds.org

If you are legally a minor, please do not submit any information without your parent or guardian's permission.

USE OF IP ADDRESSES

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. It does not tell anything about you personally or your home computer -- only the big computer to which you have connected to get on the internet.

Our system keeps track of IP addresses to help with security and to generate aggregate reports, such as the number of users visiting a site each day.

Some services within our sites, such as some message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing.

USE OF COOKIES

Cookies are tiny pieces of data that a website sends to your computer so your preferences and visit information can be saved from visit-to-visit. For example, if you log in and create a profile on our system, your computer will get a cookie so that the system recognizes you when you return. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies, and the cookie information we send will only make sense to our website -- there is no "personal" information included. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites.

Please note that "normal" cookies from established sites like ours are not a security risk through the internet. If, however, other people have access to your computer (the one you are using right now!), then they could come online and our systems will think they are you. As you can see from our security information, you are protected from any charges they might incur.

If you choose to not accept cookies from our sites, you can still use the system -- but some functions will not work properly -- and you will have to re-enter information more often. For example, if you make a purchase through our store, and you do not allow cookies, the computer can not remember you when you shop again. You control how and if you accept cookies through your web browsers preference controls.

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. We do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.

LINKS TO OTHER SITES

If you click on a link to another site, you may be leaving sites controlled by Six Seconds, and our privacy policy does not extend to their sites.

SECURITY

Private Profile: Private information submitted to us is encoded to the highest standards of electronic security. We use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption, our servers are monitored 24 hours a day, and have never had a security problem.

Receipts: You will receive an automatic receipt for each and every transaction on our system. If you see a problem, simply reply to that message and inform us the error.

Public Profile: The Six Seconds sites have functions that allow users to post private information. Six Seconds can not and does not control who accesses information that you have made public, and you accept any risk in publishing your information.

Six Seconds can not and does not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.

Your Profile is password-protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.

YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS

By using this site, you accept this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the our sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
