**A. Overview**

In order to offer some of 6dgr's Services and reduce fraud, 6dgr ("6dgr" or "WE") may ask you to provide us information about yourself such as : name and email address, gender, age, occupation, and location. 6dgr is a unique online community promoting wealth building and financial responsibility. 6dgr connects people through an invitation only approach that creates a specialized network of friends and their respective group affiliations. To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles, which are shown to the people in their personal network. A personal network consists of a user's friends as well as the extended group of people that a user is connected to via chains of mutual friends. To fulfill the purpose of this site, some personal information we ask for is displayed to people within these personal networks.

This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we use that information. WE take the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will not sell nor rent your personally identifiable information or a list of our customers to third parties. However, as described in more detail in Part C below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your information will be shared with third parties, under strict restrictions, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all services that are hosted on the 6dgr Web Site, whether 6dgr (or its subsidiaries or its affiliates) offers the services. 

This site may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that WE are not responsible for the privacy practices of other Web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

By accepting the Privacy Policy and [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20091219084457id_/http%3A//www.6dgr.com/index.php?mode=terms) in registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the 6dgr [Terms and Conditions.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091219084457id_/http%3A//www.6dgr.com/index.php?mode=terms)

Your personal information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your country, but WE will hold and transmit your personal information in a safe, confidential and secure environment. If you object to your personal information being transferred or used as described in this Privacy Policy, please do not register for the 6dgr service.

**_Notification of Changes_**

This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the 6dgr Service or as we incorporate suggestions from our customers. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information, you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. Any material changes will be effective only after we provide you by e-mail with at least 30 days' notice of the amended Privacy Policy (if you have closed your 6dgr account, you will not be contacted to notify you of the amended Policy and your personal information will not be used or disclosed in this new manner).

We will post the amended Privacy Policy prominently on our website so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check the 6dgr Web Site [http://www.6dgr.com](http://www.6dgr.com/) at any time for the most current version of our Privacy Policy.

**B. Information We Collect**

**_Required Information_**

To open a 6dgraccount, you must provide your name, company name (if applicable), phone number, and e-mail address. In order to receive payments through 6dgr, you must apply for and receive a 6dgr financial product offered on the Web Site. For your enhanced security, we may also ask you to choose different security questions to answer. This required information may be necessary for us to process transactions, issue a new password if you forget or lose your password, protect you against credit card fraud, and to contact you should the need arise in administering your account.

In order to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, we may also require additional information if you receive certain high-value transactions or high overall payment volumes through 6dgr. If you choose to register or apply for certain optional features or products offered through the 6dgr WebSites, you will be required to provide additional information to establish that you qualify for such features or products.

**_Transaction Information_**

When you use 6dgr to send money to someone else or request money from someone else, we ask you to provide information related to each transaction, including the amount of the transaction and the e-mail address of the third party. We retain this information for each of your transactions through 6dgr. We also collect the Internet address (IP address) of the computer or device you use to access your 6dgr account, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorized transactions.

**_Information About You From Third Parties_**

In order to protect all our Members against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information you provide. In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, when you register a 6dgr checking, savings, brokerage, debit or credit card with 6dgr, we may use standard authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to 6dgr, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.

If you receive high overall payment volumes through 6dgr, in some circumstances we may conduct a background check on you or your business by obtaining information about you and your business from a credit bureau or a business information service. If you incur a debt to 6dgr, we will generally conduct a credit check on you by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, to the extent permitted by law. 6dgr, at its sole discretion, also reserves the right periodically to retrieve and review a business or consumer credit report for any account, and reserves the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit review process.

**_Additional Verification_**

If we cannot verify the information that you provide, or if you request a withdrawal by check to an address other than your verified credit card billing address, we may ask you to send us additional information (such as your drivers' license, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other information linking you to the applicable address), or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information.

**_Website Traffic Information_**

Because of the way that Internet communication standards work, when you arrive at or leave the 6dgr Web Site, we automatically receive the Internet address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on which pages of our website you visit while you are on the 6dgr Web Site, the type of browser you use and the times you access our website. We may use this information only to try to understand our customers' preferences better and to manage the load on our servers, so as to improve our service and your experience with 6dgr. We do not track the websites that you visit before or after you leave the 6dgr site. 

**_Our Use of "Cookies"_**

"Cookies" are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a 6dgr customer. If you return to the 6dgr site using the same computer and browser, We send a "session cookie" to your computer when you log in to your account by entering your e-mail address and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect. 

We also use longer-lasting cookies to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't have to retype the e-mail address each time when you log in to your 6dgr account. 

**_Customer Service Correspondence_**

If you send us correspondence, we may retain such information in the records of your account. We may also retain customer service correspondence and other correspondence from 6dgr to you. We may retain these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and violations of our Terms and Conditions. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law. 

**_Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data_**

From time to time, we may offer optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests and needs. The use of the information collected will be explained in detail in the survey itself. If we collect personally identifiable information from our users in these questionnaires and surveys, the users will be given notice of how the information will be used prior to their participation in the survey or questionnaire.

**_Email Choice/Opt-out_**

Users who no longer wish to receive our weekly updates or newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in the email or by logging-in and changing their settings in the Account Tab section of the site. 

**C. Our Use and Disclosure of Information**

**_Internal Uses_**

Profile information as well as first name and photos are displayed to people in a user's personal network, to support the function of the site as a business networking community where users can meet new people through their friends. Email address and full name are used when a user invites a friend via email to join the Service, when a user requests to add another user to their friend list, and when we send notifications to a user related to their use of the Service. Except when inviting or adding friends, a user's email address is not shared or displayed with people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on 6dgr with each other through the 6dgr Service, without disclosing email addresses. We may also use a user's email address to send weekly updates or news regarding our site, but the user may choose not to receive email of this type by accessing their Account Tab Info.

We collect, store and process your personal information on servers located in the United States. We use the information we collect about you in order to provide our Services and process your transactions, to provide customer service, to determine your eligibility to receive offers for special features or products, and to improve our products and services. At your option (as indicated in your user settings), we use the information you provide to access specific third party services on your behalf and perform the actions that you request us to perform.

We give access to individually identifiable information about our users only to those employees who require it to fulfill customer service requests. 

**_Invite a Friend_**

If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. WE will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. WE store this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the friends list of the user sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation. 6dgr does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. The friend may contact 6dgr to request the removal of this information from our database.

**_Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums_**

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example, on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas \- that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

**_Disclosure to Other Customers_**

If you are a registered user, your name, e-mail address, date of sign-up, and other information may be displayed to other 6dgr Members whom you have signed-up or who are attempting to sign up through 6dgr. Your credit card or debit card number and any other financial information will never be revealed to anyone whom you have invited or who has accepted through 6dgr, except if we are required to do so pursuant to a state or federal law.   
If you are buying goods or services and paying through 6dgr, the seller of the goods or services may request that you provide a mailing address that 6dgr has confirmed as matching the billing address in the credit card system. You do not have to provide this information. If you do not provide the information, however, the seller may choose not to accept your payment and not to complete the transaction. 

6dgr may also disclose to other customers the number of payments you have received from "VERIFIED" or "CERTIFIED" customers (as defined in the Terms and Conditions on the 6dgr site), or other aggregate measures that provide an indication of your reputation with other customers.

**_Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than Customers_**

6dgr will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. 6dgr will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below, or with your express permission (and to other customers as described above). These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared. We share information with companies that help us process the transactions you request and protect our customers' transactions from fraud, such as sharing your credit card number with a service that screens for lost and stolen card numbers. See "Information About You From Third Parties" in Section B above. 

We disclose the information we collect, as described in Section B above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. These companies may be subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit using the information except to market the specified 6dgr-related products or services, unless you have affirmatively agreed or given your prior permission for other uses.

We disclose information that we in good faith believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our [Terms and Conditions.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091219084457id_/http%3A//www.6dgr.com/index.php?mode=terms) Specifically, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information (but not bank account or credit card information) to victims who request it.   
We disclose information in response to State and federal court orders. 

If a user signs up for a co-branded version of a 6dgrthrough links on our co-branded partner's website, 6dgr will share with the co-branded partner that user's name, e-mail address and physical address in order to provide enhanced integration between 6dgr's Services and the services of our co-branded partner. If a user does not want his or her information shared with 6dgr's co-branded partner, he or she should not use this aspect of the site. 

We disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you) after proof of same is provided to us.

We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in British Columbia. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information.

As with any other business, it is possible that 6dgr in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by 6dgr, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless an until it is amended as described in Section A above.

We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety. 

**_Third Party Advertising_**

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. 6dgr does not have access to nor control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by 6dgr and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**_Our Contacts with Customers_**

We communicate with users on a regular basis via e-mail to provide requested services, and we also communicate by phone to resolve customer complaints or investigate suspicious transactions. We use your e-mail address to confirm your opening of a 6dgr account, to send you notice of payments that you send or receive through 6dgr (including referral payments described below), to send information about important changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.

We also may use your e-mail address to send you other types of communications that you can control, including tips, newsletters, customer surveys and notice of special third-party promotions. You can choose whether to receive some, all or none of these communications when you complete the registration process, or at any time thereafter, by logging in to your account on the 6dgr Web Site and changing your user preferences. You can also change your choices at any time through the same procedure.

In connection with independent audits of our financial statements and operations, auditors may seek to contact a sample of our customers to confirm that our records are accurate. However, these auditors cannot use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**_Internet Address Information_**

We use IP addresses, browser types and access times to analyze trends, administer the site, improve site performance and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

**_Your Use of Information and Our Services_**

In order to facilitate the transactions between **6dgr** members and the 6dgr financial partner network, our Service allows the financial partner's limited access to your contact information. 

By entering into our [Terms and Conditions,](https://web.archive.org/web/20091219084457id_/http%3A//www.6dgr.com/index.php?mode=terms) you agree that, with respect to other users' personally identifiable information that you obtain through the site or through an 6dgr related communication or 6dgr facilitated transaction, you will only use this information for: (a) 6dgr related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages  
(b) using Services offered through 6dgr.  
(c) any other purpose that such user expressly agrees to after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s).

In all cases, you must provide users with the opportunity to remove themselves from your database and review any information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personally identifiable information about another 6dgr user to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other user after adequate disclosure. Note that law enforcement personnel and other rights holders are given different rights with respect to information they access.

6dgr does not tolerate unsolicited commercial e-mail or "spam". Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you may not add a 6dgr user to your mail list (e-mail or physical mail) without their express consent after adequate disclosure, even if said user has previously had their profile set to accept all messages. Our anti-spam policy is strictly enforced.

**D. Information Security**

We handle your customer information with high standards of information security. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.

The security of your account also relies on your protection of your password. You should not share your password with anyone. **Our representatives will never ask you for your password, so any e-mail or other communication requesting your password should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious.** If you do share your password with a third party for any reason, including because the third party has promised to provide you additional services such as account aggregation, the third party will have access to your account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using your password. If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please change it immediately by logging in to your account at 6dgr and changing your user settings, and also contact us right away as described in Section F below.

**E. Accessing and Changing Your Information**

You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to such information, or to the settings for your account, at any time by logging in to your account on the 6dgr Web Site and changing your user preferences. You can also close your account through the 6dgr Web Site. If you close your account, we will mark your account in our database as

 **"CLOSED"** but will keep your account information in our database. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, or as required by law.
