					<h4>01.COM WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
      
	 				<p>The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world. It's important to 01.com to help our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer. There is also private information that we must know in order to trouble-shoot some of your computer problems together.</p>
					
      				<p>We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is important to you…and to us. So we'll protect the information you share with us. To protect your privacy, 01.com follows principles in accordance with worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection.</p>
      				
					<ul>
        				<li> We won’t sell your name, mail address, phone number, email address, credit card number or any other information to anyone without your permission.</li>
        				<li>We’ll use state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, no less than that which we use for the security of our own data.</li>
      				</ul>
      				
					<h4>NOTICE</h4>
      				
					<p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you create a Registration ID on our site or when you download certain software, enter a contest, order email newsletters or subscribe to one of our services. We use your Personal Information for five primary purposes:</p>
      				
					<ol>
       				<li> To deliver service and securely bill you for services you order from 01.com.</li>
        				<li>To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>
        				<li>To help trouble-shoot the services you order from 01.com.</li>
        				<li>To request feedback from you on our services.</li>
        				<li>To alert you to planned outages, product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from 01.com that may impact our service.</li>
      				</ol>
      
	 				<h4>CONSENT</h4>
      
	 				<p>If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of the 01.com website, but you will not be able to access areas that require registration.</p>
      				
					<p>If you decide to subscribe, with the exception of request for feedback and messages about service interruptions or other messages that may directly impact your subscription services, such as those for scheduled maintenance, you will be able to select the kinds of information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various services, like our electronic newsletter, blog and electronic survey system. If you do not want us to communicate with you about other offers regarding 01.com products, programs, events, or services by email, postal mail, or telephone, you will not receive marketing messages from 01.com.</p>
      				
					<h4>ACCESS</h4>
					
      				<p>We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time at our Support center. There, you can:</p>
      				
					<ul>
        				<li> View and edit personal information you have already given us.</li>
       				<li>Search our knowledgebase for answers to frequently asked questions.</li>
        				<li>Download software and updates.</li>
        				<li>Submit support tickets to track issues and their resolutions.</li>
        				<li>Add contacts, addresses and billing information.</li>
        				<li>Add, change and cancel services.</li>
      				</ul>
					
      				<h4>SECURITY</h4>
					
      				<p>01.com has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
      				
					<p>When you place orders or access your personal account information, you're utilizing a secure server using 256-bit SSL, which encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies available.</p>
					
      				<p>In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair Credit Billing Act. This Act states that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 in fraudulent credit card charges. If your bank does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we'll cover your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from purchases made from us over our secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.</p>
      
	 				<p>01.com strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
      				
					<p>Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the USA or any other country where 01.com, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.</p>
					
      				<p>You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your user name and password, so do not share these with others.</p>
      				
					<h4>ENFORCEMENT</h4>
      
	 				<p>If for some reason you believe 01.com has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at privacy ( at ) 01.com, and we will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.</p>
					
      				<h4>CUSTOMER PROFILES</h4>
					
      				<p>As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.</p>
      				
					<p>When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal identification number, then send this personal identification number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is your passport to seamless travel across an 01.com website, allowing you to download free software, order free newsletters, and visit premium sites without having to fill out registration forms with information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to re-register – just use your Registration ID to identify yourself.</p>
      
	 				<h4>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</h4>
					
      				<p>When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including your name and email address. We use this information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer, when those services may impact service, such as with upgrades and new features about which you may want to know. When you order from us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. We use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. For your convenience, we do save billing information to bill you for any recurring services you may have ordered, and in case you want to order from us again, and we don't use this information again without your permission.</p>
					
      				<p>01.com will disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on 01.com or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of 01.com and its family of Websites, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of customers of 01.com, its Websites, or the public, and, (d) conform to the policies of your organization in the case in which your organization is a client in good-standing of 01.com.</p>
