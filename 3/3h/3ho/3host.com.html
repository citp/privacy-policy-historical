        Policy</strong></p>
      <p><u><strong>I. Welcome</strong></u> <br>
        <br>
        3Host.com is proud to be the home of a adult webmaster community 
        in cyberspace.<br>
        <br>
        This privacy policy applies to the web sites, or networks, owned by 3Host.com, 
        ("The 3Host Network").<br>
        <br>
        Even though The 3Host Network provides a different combination 
        of services, this policy states the company-wide Privacy Policy with regard 
        to data collection practices. <br>
        <br>
        By visiting The 3Host Network, becoming a registered member of 
        any of the sites, you hereby provide your consent to the terms of this 
        Privacy Policy, and are aware that our policy may change over time as 
        discussed below. Specifically, this Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect 
        new features, services and options, and any changes on the use of personal 
        information. Continued use of &nbsp;The 3Host Network and its 
        services will indicate that you agree with any changes. <br>
        <br>
        Your privacy on the Internet is incredibly important to The 3Host 
        Network and should also be to you too! The 3Host Network collects 
        certain information about its visitors and members. The 3Host 
        Network feels that you should fully understand the terms and conditions 
        that deal with that collection and use of information. This privacy statement 
        discloses what information we collect, how we use it, and how to correct 
        or change it. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>II. Nature of Information Collected</strong></u> <br>
        <br>
        There are two types of information collected by The Sultr yServer Network 
        core site: (A) anonymous and (B) personally identifiable. The 3Host 
        Network's collection practices regarding these two are discussed in greater 
        detail below. <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <p><strong>A. Anonymous Information Collection</strong> <br>
          <br>
          Anonymous information refers to information that cannot be tied back 
          to a specific individual. As with visiting any web site, The 3Host Network collects some basic information about your computer, 
          including browser type, operating system, IP address, Internet service 
          provider and geographic location. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>B. Personally Identifiable Information</strong> <strong><br>
          </strong><br>
          Personally identifiable information can be used to directly identify 
          an individual. The 3Host Network requires a limited amount of 
          personal information to be collected in order to better serve you. This 
          allows 3Host to set up your e-mail account and give you free 
          web page space. </p>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>III. Use of Cookies</strong></u> <br>
        <br>
        The 3Host Network uses cookies on the join and login pages. A 
        cookie is simply a small data file sent to your computer by The 3Host 
        Network that identifies your computer as a unique user to a specific web 
        site. It also collects anonymous information and tracks traffic patterns. 
        A cookie will not provide any personally identifiable information about 
        you, nor will it read data off of your hard drive, or read cookie files 
        created by other web sites. The 3Host Network uses the information 
        provided by a cookie for tracking site usage and targeting of advertising. 
        This allows The 3Host Network to customize your visit and save 
        you time during subsequent visits. <br>
        <br>
        By visiting any of &nbsp;The 3Host Network sites and/or registering 
        to become a member, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. <br>
        <br>
        The 3Host Network places advertising on our sites that originates 
        from third party advertisers and/or advertising agencies. In some cases, 
        if you click on or view these ads, the advertiser may assign you a cookie. 
        The 3Host Network does not control these cookies. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>IV. Purposes for Which Information is Collected</strong></u> 
        <br>
        <br>
        The 3Host Network tracks anonymous information to determine which 
        pages are preferred based on traffic to those areas. This information 
        is aggregated to provide The 3Host Network with demographic and 
        other statistical data that allows us to assess how well our web site 
        is performing. This helps us to continue building a better service for 
        you. The 3Host Network does not track what individual users read, 
        only the performance of each page overall. <br>
        <br>
        The personal information collected from our members, or anyone that submits 
        their personal information, is also used for the administration of our 
        site; including corresponding with our members by e-mail when required 
        and setting the content of web site.. <br>
        <br>
        The 3Host Network compiles statistical data on the number of visitors 
        who access the banners and advertisements on our web site so that we can 
        provide marketing information to our advertisers and sponsors. The 3Host Network aggregates this information and creates statistical reports 
        from the anonymous and demographic information for our advertisers. This 
        allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users 
        to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their interests and needs. 
        Also, because The 3Host Network derives their revenue mainly from 
        advertising, providing this data is essential to maintaining our services 
        as free to users. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>IV. Sharing of Information Collected by The 3Host Network</strong></u> 
        <br>
        <br>
        The 3Host Network shares anonymous data collected from visitors 
        and citizens with third party advertisers and advertising agencies so 
        that they may target their advertising and provide better services. The 
        3Host Network does not, however, disclose any personal information 
        to these third parties without first obtaining your consent. <br>
        <br>
        The 3Host Network will cooperate, as appropriate, with police, 
        judicial and other law enforcement agencies and disclose personal information 
        and data upon receipt of the appropriate court orders. The 3Host 
        Network will also share personal information where it appears that, based 
        on sufficient evidence, a visitor or a member is engaged, through the 
        use of or access to this web site and its services, in illegal activities. 
        The 3Host Network refers citizens to The 3Host Network's 
        Terms of Use. The 3Host Network reserves the right in the absence 
        of a court order, to release information concerning a citizen who The 
        3Host Network believe is in violation of the guidelines or is 
        using The 3Host Network's servers for illegal activities. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>V. Collection of Data by Third Parties</strong></u> <br>
        <br>
        This web site contains links to other web sites. When accessing the web 
        sites of third parties advertising on The 3Host Network, including 
        through ad banners and other links, you will be accessing sites that are 
        not operated or controlled by The 3Host Network. These sites may 
        collect anonymous and personal information by various methods, including 
        the use of cookies. The privacy policies of these web sites may not be 
        the same as those of The 3Host Network and may not afford visitors 
        and citizens the same level of protection. Visitors and citizens should 
        contact these advertisers to verify the privacy policies of these web 
        sites and their terms of use when accessing them and prior to providing 
        any anonymous or personal information. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>VI. Export of Data</strong></u> <br>
        <br>
        The 3Host Network may export information collected from visitors 
        and members to countries or territories other than the country of residence 
        of the visitors and citizens (including countries that do not necessarily 
        afford by law the same amount of protection to personal information as 
        the country of residence). The 3Host Network complies with the 
        laws and/or policies that protect a country's citizens from any dissemination 
        of exported data to third parties without prior consent. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>VII. Chat Rooms and Message Boards</strong></u> <br>
        <br>
        The 3Host Network does not monitor their chat rooms or message 
        boards. You are advised to consult the guidelines in the Chat and Message 
        Board Rules. When engaging in chat rooms and message boards, you may be 
        invited by third parties to provide your own personal information. That 
        information could be used by third parties for purposes that you do not 
        wish they be used, including unsolicited e-mails and sharing of personal 
        information with other third parties. The 3Host Network strongly 
        suggests that you do not share any of your personal information with third 
        parties in chat rooms or message boards. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>VIII. Storage and Security</strong></u> <br>
        <br>
        Data collected by The 3Host Network is stored in secure servers 
        located in New Jersey. The 3Host Network has security procedures 
        in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under 
        its control. These security measures include the necessary protection 
        to prevent, as far as possible, access to The 3Host Network databases 
        to parties other than The 3Host Network. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>IX. Review, Correction of Information and Deactivation of Citizenship</strong></u> 
        <br>
        <br>
        Members and anyone who has submitted personal information may, at any 
        time, review the information relating to them contained in The 3Host Network's databases and edit any incorrect information. <br>
        <br>
        A member may decide at any time to terminate his/her membership with The 
        3Host Network. If so, a member should contact The 3Host 
        Network using the contact information provided to request the termination 
        and deletion of any personal information already collected by The 3Host Network. Please be advised that because of backups, and records 
        of deletions, it may be impossible to delete all information about a member 
        without some residual information still remaining. <br>
        <br>
        All requests to review, edit, or terminate a citizenship will be processed 
        by The 3Host Network within a reasonable time of their receipt. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>X. Protection of Minors</strong></u> <br>
        <br>
        The protection of children's online privacy is very important to The 3Host Network. For that reason, it is our policy not to collect or maintain 
        information at our web sites from those we actually know are under 18 
        and no part of our web sites is structured to attract anyone under 18. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <u><strong>XI. Consent, Opt-In and Opt-Out</strong></u> <br>
        <br>
        Visitors and members of The 3Host Network confirm by visiting 
        any of the sites or the submission of their personal information that 
        they consent to the collection and processing of personal information, 
        the use of cookies and transfer of personal data in countries other than 
        their country of residence as detailed above. <br>
        <br>
        Should a member at any time wish to withdraw his/her consent and opt-out 
        of receiving communications from The 3Host Network, the member 
        should inform The 3Host Network by following the procedures set 
        out in the Review, Correction of Information and Deactivation of Citizenship 
        section. <br>
