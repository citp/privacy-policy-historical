Our websites may use social media features, such as the Facebook 'like' button ("Social Media Features"). These features may collect Your IP address and which page You are visiting on Our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about Your activities on Our website to a profile page of Yours that is provided by a third party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on Our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.

If You purchase or specifically express interest in a product or service of one of Our partners, We may share Personal Information about You with such partner. We do not control the use of Your Personal Information that we collect, and their use will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. However, We will ensure that they are bound by a non-disclosure agreement with Us.

We do not sell, rent or trade Your Personal Information to third parties. We will not use any PII we collect from You or Your customers to contact or market to Your customers or directly compete with You.

We use third party payment processors to assist Us in processing and share with them Your PII payment information securely. Such third party processors use of Your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this privacy policy.

We may use other third parties to help Us provide services and marketing to You, such as shipping or fulfilling orders, processing payments, monitoring site activity, conducting quality assurance and testing, providing support, conducting surveys, and administering e-mails, and share with them Your Personal Information solely for those purposes. If We share any Personal Information with any of these third parties, We will require that such information be used only to provide the services requested by Us and be maintained by them in strictest confidence.
