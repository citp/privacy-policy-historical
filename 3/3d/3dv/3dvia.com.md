The purpose of this “Privacy Policy” is to inform all individuals from whom Personal Data is collected by 3DS ("You" or "Your") how 3DS collects and uses such Personal Data and how You can control its use. 

Please, note that this Privacy Policy does not cover the AppsforKids products and services which are subject to a separate privacy policy that can be found on the AppsforKids website. 

### 1\. SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY 

This Privacy Policy sets forth the principles and guidelines governing the protection of Your Personal Data including the Personal Data collected on or through the Sites. 

3DS collects Personal Data either online (including via email) or offline and this Privacy Policy is applicable regardless of the means of collection or processing. 

Personal data ("Personal Data") means any information relating to an identified or identifiable person. An identifiable person is a person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to the person. 

Non-Personal Data means any information that does not result in the identification of a person. 

For visitors and users of the Sites: each Site is subject to Terms of Use that can be found on each Site and are incorporated into this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Sites and any Personal Data You provide on the Sites are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable Terms of Use. 

### 2\. DATA COLLECTED 

Personal Data likely includes: 

  * Title; 
  * first and last name; 
  * postal address; 
  * email address; 
  * telephone number(s); 
  * login and password; 
  * university, degree and courses taken;

However, certain 3DS products and services may be appropriate for use by children, and in that case children must seek consent from their parents prior to creating a 3DS account. Teachers and school administrators may act in the place of parents and provide consent for the collection of Personal Data from children (schools should always ensure that they have received permission from parents to do so). 

If parents become aware that their child has provided 3DS with Personal Data without their consent or without a teacher’s or school administrator’s consent, they can ask 3DS to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account by sending an email to: 3DS.Compliance-Privacy(at)3ds.com. 

If 3DS becomes aware that it has collected Personal Data from a child under 13, 3DS will take steps to seek the parent’s consent for that processing or to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account.
