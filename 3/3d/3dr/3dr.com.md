**3DR Mobile App Services Provided to You by Third Parties**

We collaborate with third parties to provide services such as no-fly-zone information, and may allow third parties to use our developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with our Services. In order to provide no-fly-zone information, we need to send your location and unique vehicle identifier to a third party service. We may send your location to a third party service in order to receive data that improves the performance of your vehicle (for example: time to acquire GPS lock).

**To Help us Monitor and Improve the Services we Offer**

We make efforts to make sure the platform keeps working. This includes using your information, where necessary, to stop spam and other activities that violate the terms of service.

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services (e.g. maintenance, analysis, audit, marketing and development). These third parties have limited access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.

**For Legal Reasons**

We may disclose your information (including your personally identifiable information, vehicle and flight information) if required to do so by law, regulation or subpoena. We may also disclose your information to our legal counsel, governmental authorities or law enforcement if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to do so in order to comply with a law or regulation; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect 3DR’s rights or property.

**Do Not Track Signals**

The Droneshare website does not currently respond to a Do Not Track (“DNT”) or similar signal as it awaits the results of efforts by the policy and legal community to determine the meaning of DNT and the proper way to respond.
