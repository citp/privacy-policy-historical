# Privacy Policy of 3dmovies.com

##### 3DMOVIES.COM®  PRIVACY POLICY

Last Revised: December 11, 2008

3DMOVIES.COM, LLC. ("3DMOVIES.COM") is concerned about your privacy and wants you to be familiar with how it collects, uses and shares your information. 3DMOVIES.COM has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. 3DMOVIES.COM collects some or all of the following information whenever you sign up for or use the various 3DMOVIES.COM services and products, including without limitation the 3DMOVIES.COM Web site, the 3dxs.com Web site, any other Web site owned or operated by 3DMOVIES.COM (each a "Site"), online mobile service, and telephone service, and/or purchase movie or other event tickets, or other products or services offered by 3DMOVIES.COM, 3dxs.com, or any affiliate (collectively, the "Service"). Some of this information is collected automatically and some is collected only when you provide it voluntarily.

A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN

3DMOVIES.COM is not designed or intended for use by children under 13. If you are under 18, you should use 3DMOVIES.COM only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Children under 13 may not submit any Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information from a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it.

ANTI-SPAM POLICY

3DMOVIES.COM is 100% opposed to unsolicited commercial email ("spam"). We do not have any desire to send unsolicited marketing emails to anyone without permission and we do not sell or provide email addresses to any unauthorized third party in violation of this Privacy Policy. If you receive any unsolicited emails from spammers, please be assured that 3DMOVIES.COM did not provide your email address to such parties.

This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. Unfortunately, spammers obtain email addresses in a number of devious ways, including when you respond and ask to be taken off a spam email list, and in some cases by just generating emails to millions of random email addresses in the hopes of getting a few "live" ones. Please be assured that at 3DMOVIES.COM we hate spam as much as you do, and we do our best to avoid contributing to it.

All of our newsletters and other general email marketing communications also include an "unsubscribe" opt-out link that you may use to ask that we discontinue such emails to you. (Even if you opt-out of our newsletter or other marketing communications, we may still send you certain transactional or administrative emails, such as email confirmations of ticket purchases, or emails regarding changes to your account.)

All that said, if you believe that you have gotten unsolicited email from us, please contact us and we will investigate. Please be assured that we strive not to contact anyone for marketing purposes without permission, and if you prefer not to receive any further marketing communications from us, just tell us and we'll try to make sure you never hear from us again.

WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DOES 3DMOVIES.COM COLLECT?

Personally Identifiable Information.

Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, credit/debit card number and expiration date (or other payment-method information), login ID, member name and password ("Personally Identifiable Information"). When you sign up for or use the Site or other Service, 3DMOVIES.COM collects some amount of Personally Identifiable Information from you. 3DMOVIES.COM also collects Personally Identifiable Information that you may voluntarily provide when you use the Site or other Service, that you may disclose in a public area of the Site or other Service (such as a rating/review page, message board or chat room), or that you may include if you communicate with 3DMOVIES.COM. In addition, when you use certain features of the Site or other Service, such as 3DMOVIES.COM Bux, 3DMOVIES.COM will collect the email addresses or other Personally Identifiable Information of others that you may provide.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

3DMOVIES.COM collects information from you automatically when you use the Site or other Service.

The automatically collected information may include information such as your browser type, the URL of the previous Web sites you visited, the Web pages and advertisements you view or select, the type of Service you use and the searches you conduct. This information also may include your movie preferences, such as the movies for which you buy tickets and the theaters where you see those movies. 3DMOVIES.COM also collects information that does not include Personally Identifiable Information when you voluntarily provide it (such as in response to a questionnaire or survey) or post it to a public area of the Site or other Service (such as a rating/review page, message board or chat room).

Other Methods.

Where authorized and as permitted by FTC guidelines and all other applicable laws, rules and regulations, 3DMOVIES.COM may also use or allow the use of web beacons, trusted vendors and other third party companies who may gather data for purposes of advertising and/or to report website traffic and statistics. 3DMOVIES.COM may also use other monitoring technologies to gather anonymous statistics about our website visitors.

Sharing with Social Networks or Other Sites You May Authorize.

Accordingly, make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third parties that you authorize to gather information from 3DMOVIES.COM.
