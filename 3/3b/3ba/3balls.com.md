**Cookies**  
Like many companies, we use "cookies" on our website. Cookies are information files that your web browser places on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. Cookies allow websites to remember user's activities on a website. For example, cookies may be used to remember what is in your shopping cart after leaving the website. You can disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser.

**IP Addresses**  
Like many companies, we automatically track certain information based on your behavior on our website. 3balls.com might use the information collected to do research on our customers’ website behavior as well as demographics. The information we collect might include the URL where you came from and the pages you go to next. We also might collect information on your IP address (Internet Protocol). An ISP provides a unique IP address every time if you are using a dial up. However for LAN or cable models, an IP address may be permanently assigned to one computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by web servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. An IP address does not identify an individual by name, however it can reveal what geographic area you are connecting from.

**Confidentiality and Security**  
3balls.com is committed to making your online ordering process secure. 3balls.com takes all necessary precautions to protect your personal information both online and off-line. When 3balls.com requests that you enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software or other security protocol, which encrypts the information you input. No administrator at 3balls.com will have knowledge of your password. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to log off from 3balls.com when finished using a shared computer. 3balls.com also protects your personal information off-line. Access to your personal information is limited to employees who 3balls.com reasonably believes will need that information to provide services to you. However, 3balls.com is not responsible for the confidentiality, security or distribution of your own personal information by our partners and third parties outside the scope of our agreement with such partners and third parties.

**Children's and Minor's Privacy**  
3balls.com strongly encourages parents and guardians to supervise the online activities of their minor children and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools also can prevent minors from disclosing their name, address, and other personally identifiable information online without parental permission. Although the site is not intended for use by minors, 3balls.com respects the privacy of minors who may inadvertently use the Internet.

**Payments**  
Credit card information on our site is strongly encrypted with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). SSL is used to communicate with secure browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox. This encryption makes it extremely difficult for anyone to access your credit card information while it is being sent from your computer to our server. Once we receive your order, we continue to protect your information and keep it secure in a data warehouse that is protected on our server. If you do not trust sending your credit card information over the Internet, feel free to call us at 508-821-3900 to take your order.
