This policy also outlines our privacy practices on our corporate Website ("Website"), www.33across.com. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at [privacy@33across.com](mailto:privacy@33across.com).

## PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY

#### OVERVIEW OF OUR TECHNOLOGY

33Across provides technology services to Clients that enable them to collect and use Social Engagement Data to improve the relevance of advertising which appears on web pages. "Social Engagement Data" consists of anonymous information regarding the relationships between people, the website pages they visit and/or the actions they take on a website, such as installing or sharing applications, widgets or other content. For example, 33Across may collect Social Engagement Data when an individual visits a Client's webpage, installs or shares an application, or connects with friends from within one of our Client(s) websites. Data is only collected from the websites of Clients who use our services.

Clients use the Social Engagement Data we capture to classify website users who are likely to share similar interests or preferences. For example, if a person expresses an interest in comedy films, our technology would help our Clients identify other people who are likely to enjoy comedy films based on similarities in Social Engagement Data between the different people. By using our technology, Clients categorize people with similar characteristics or interests, improving their ability to deliver more relevant advertising. 33Across maintains Social Engagement Data for up to 90 days for purposes of identifying people with similar characteristics or interests. After 90 days, Social Engagement Data is no longer used for these purposes, but is used for research and reporting on an aggregated basis for up to 2 years. The cookies we use to improve the relevance of advertising which appears on web pages are set to expire after 1 year.

You may encounter our technology when: you visit one of our Clients' websites; we purchase online advertisements on a website that you visit; and/or when our Clients purchase online advertisements on a website that you visit.

## DATA OUR TECHNOLOGY COLLECTS FROM CLIENT WEBSITES

#### PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") means any data which identifies you personally, such as name, address, email, or telephone number. We do not collect PII from Client websites via our Technology.

#### NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

When you are on the website of one of our Clients, our technology collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII"), which refers to information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity. Non-PII includes, but is not limited to, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type (for example Internet Explorer or Mozilla), operating system (for example Windows or Macintosh), the URL of Client website pages or sections that you visit, and Social Engagement Data.

#### USAGE OF COOKIES

Nearly all websites, including those of our Clients, use a feature of your internet browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. Cookies are small text files that contain alphanumeric characters. The website which places a cookie on your computer can then recognize the computer when you revisit the site. This enables the site to provide services such as automatic log-on, customizable content or settings, and relevant ad delivery. Our technology uses cookies to help make the advertising you see more relevant.

You are always free to decline to receive cookies, but by doing so you may not be able to use many common website features or take advantage of targeted advertising. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the ''Help'' menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

You may click [HERE](http://optout.33across.com/api/) to opt-out of data collection and targeting cookies from 33Across. Additionally, 33Across is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and is compliant with the NAI's Self-Regulatory Principles. You may click [HERE](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) to find out more about the NAI's Self-Regulatory Program and to opt out of 33Across and other NAI member company advertising programs.

Opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that 33Across will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns. The 33Across Opt-out Tool is cookie-based. In order for the Tool to work on your computer, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task again. Be advised that if you change computers or browsers, or use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this process for each computer and each browser.

This includes, but is not limited to, the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

#### DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES

We do not rent or share your PII with non-affiliated third parties without your consent. We may, however, share your PII with trusted third party contractors who provide services for us. These third party contractors are prohibited from using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services for us.

We may share Non-PII collected on the Website or via our Technology with unaffiliated third parties.

We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
