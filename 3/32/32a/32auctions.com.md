Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. We reserve the right to modify this policy from time to time. For additional information, please see the [Privacy](https://web.archive.org/web/20130522083215id_/http%3A//www.32auctions.com/pages/terms.html#privacy) section of the Terms of Use.

We don't share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.

We don't engage in cross-marketing or link-referral programs with other sites.

We don't employ tracking devices for marketing purposes ("cookies", "web beacons," single-pixel gifs).

We don't send you unsolicited communications for marketing purposes.

32auctions, or people who list auction items on 32auctions, may provide links to third party websites, which may have different privacy practices. We are not responsible for, nor have any control over, the privacy policies of those third party websites, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18.

You can access and modify the information you provide us by signing-in to your account. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or allowing modifications to be made.
