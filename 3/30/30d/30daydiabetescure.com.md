### How we treat your information

**We will never spam you.** We will only send you information and offers we approve. The only way anyone else can get your email address in any way related to us is if you respond to an offer we sent you from another company, giving that other company your information.   **We will never disclose your personal information without your permission.** We will never sell, rent or share your personal information with a 3rd party, unless required by law. And we will fight even that if we can!   **We give you full control over your information, including the ability to wipe it from our system** You can update your account information and preferences at any time. You can destroy your account when you choose.   **We will only access your personal information when:**

  * You specifically request us to do so (e.g. you are having technical difficulties, or wish to purchase something from us, and want us to help you by phone).
  * It is required by law.
  * It is necessary to maintain our system.



**We have no plans to, but if we ever do, we may sell, rent or share information about user habits in aggregate only.** _We will never do so in a manner that could even remotely be individually identifiable._   For example, we could collect and share information like "how many people bought a book in zip code 87505?" but we would NEVER share information like "who bought a book in zip code 87505?"  

### What information do we collect?

**Personal:** _Name, email addresses, password_ All passwords are stored on our server in encrypted form - not even we can tell what they are! If you lose your password, we will generate a new one and send it to you.   **Transactions:** _Purchases of Jim Healthy Publications products only_ We collect your billing and shipping information so that we can delivery any books or other products you purchase from us and save it on an encrypted, secure server so that we can handle returns or other issues after purchase. We don’t know what other products you might buy from our partners. We do keep track of what you buy from us, so we don’t offer it to you again!   **Usage:** _Number of logins, last login, activity (pages visited, links clicked) and error logs_   This data helps us monitor and improve the performance of our web site, and diagnose errors and slowness issues when they crop up.
