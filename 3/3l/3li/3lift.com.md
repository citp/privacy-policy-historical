If we combine such information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information as long as it is combined.

**COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES**

We use cookies in connection with our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we store on your computer’s or mobile device’s memory.  Cookies help us better understand the effectiveness of an ad (for example, by tracking the way in which you respond to, select and interact with an Ad or any content provided therein, or the location and context in which you view an Ad, and for managing the frequency in which you see particular ads). Some cookies help you navigate our Services, including setting a cookie to remember your login details. Other cookies collect information about how you use our Services, which highlights areas we can improve, including navigation. If you submit an inquiry through our website and provide your name and email and similar information, that personal information will not be tied back to you for interest-based advertising purposes across websites and applications, however, you may receive email marketing communications from us.  To opt out of marketing communications, see “Choices.”

We may also use “pixel tags” “web beacons”, “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “Pixel Tags”) to analyze usage patterns of consumers. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, which is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page or in a mobile application and may be associated with cookies on your hard drive. Some Pixel Tags are used to drop cookies on users’ devices. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain websites and applications of our publisher clients, and pages within such websites and applications, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.

Cookies and Pixel Tags also help us operate and improve our Services, including to verify legitimacy of traffic, and to help us send you personalized, targeted Ads that you see because of information collected through such Pixel Tags and stored within your cookie embedded on your device(s).  To opt out of interest-based advertising see “Choices.”

Third parties may also use cookies or similar technologies on visitors of our websites to serve interest-based advertisements to such visitors when they visit other websites and mobile applications, including advertisements promoting our Services.

Publishers, advertisers and advertising partners that participate in the Services may also utilize cookies or similar technologies to deliver ads and monitor the performance of such ads. The collection of information through cookies or similar technologies by such third parties will be governed by their own privacy policies and principles, which TripleLift does not control.

Your browser may offer tools to enable or disable cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, please note that certain features of the TripleLift Pages may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Moreover, if you delete cookies after previously opting out of TripleLift’s platform practices, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

For more information about cookies and your choices regarding cookies, see “ **Choices**.”

At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” headers and similar mechanisms.

TripleLift is a data processor with respect to personal data collected or received by us when we receive such information from our publisher clients (the data controllers) that make their data available for use via our Services.  Where we operate as a data processor, we are processing the data on behalf of our clients (the data controller(s) of the data) based on their instructions, and it is the responsibility of the data controller to establish an appropriate legal basis for the processing of the data. For example, we may process data when it is in our clients’ and our legitimate interests to do so and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights. Those legitimate interests include performing our obligations with respect to providing the Services and improving our Services. On certain occasions we may rely on the consent of the individual to process personal information, as determined by our publisher clients.

TripleLift is a data controller with respect to any personal data collected or received by us (1) when we receive personal information through our TripleLift Pages and (2) when we operate our advertising bidder or our buying-related Services with which we send advertising bid requests.  In such cases, the data controller is Triple Lift, Inc. Where TripleLift operates as a data controller, we rely on legitimate interests to process personal data to provide our Services and operate our advertising bidder. On certain occasions, we may also rely on the consent of the individual to process personal information as a controller. On other occasions, we may process personal information when we need to do this to fulfill a contract or where we are required to do so by law.

We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, or an individual requests deletion in accordance with applicable law.  See “Access and Rights regarding Personal Information.”
