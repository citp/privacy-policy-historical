>  Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to a user's computer hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you are at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. Accepting a cookie does not give anyone access to your computer or to any personal information. It is simply a small file in which we keep information that identifies you as a unique user. For example, we may use a cookie to indicate when you have already voted for a particular site to prevent multiple voting and a distortion of results.

> The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them at most major Web sites. Most browsers are initially configured to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Although you will still be able to enjoy many of the features on the Site if you disable your browser from accepting cookies, some parts of the Site’s service will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies.

> About IP Addresses and Surveys Used for Research Purposes 
> 
> An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers - the computers that "serve up" Web pages - automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When users request pages on the site, our servers log their IP addresses. Some activities within the Site, such as posting a chat message, may display IP addresses along with the user's first name and message. Please review each activity prior to use and only participate in those that involve the disclosure of information you are comfortable with sharing.

You may occasionally get cookies from businesses that advertise on the site which the Operators do not control and when you link to the Web sites of third party advertisers, for example through an advertising banner, your use of those sites will be subject to the privacy policies of such third parties, which may differ from the Operators’ Privacy Policy. **Your Acceptance of These Terms
