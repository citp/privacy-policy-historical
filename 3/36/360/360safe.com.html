                            occurred or Software crashed and improve the quality of the product. Before uploading the error
                            log and the DUMP file, Software will prompt you to agree to the upload. If you agree, Software
                            will upload the error log and the DUMP file to 360 Cloud Security Center; and if you do not agree,
                            Software will not upload the log. The error log is a record of Software errors and/or crashes.
                            DUMP files are generated by the operating system when a program crashes, and contain the program
                            execution status of the crash, including the time of crash and system information. They do not
