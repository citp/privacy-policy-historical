<h1>
        Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        <cite>3xconversionformula.com</cite> strives to offer its visitors the many
        advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized
        experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address,
        street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We
        hate spam as much as you do and <em>we will never sell, barter, or rent your email address
            to any unauthorized third party</em>—period.</p>
    <h2>
        How We Gather Information From Our Users</h2>
    <p>
        How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities
        in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may
        be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions
        of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a
        purchase. Like most Web sites, 3xconversionformula.com also collects information
        automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to
        our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider
        or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit.
        Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you
        from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the
        number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site.
        As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other
        means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for
        example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may
        be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your
        user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features
        according to your preferences.</p>
    <h2>
        What We Do With The Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver
        more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not
        share your information with anyone.</p>
    <p>
        Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be
        used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns
        with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and
        services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most
        attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers
        and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable
        Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually. We may use Personally
        Identifiable Information collected on 3xconversionformula.com to communicate
        with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service
        and privacy policy; services and products offered by 3xconversionformula.com
        and other topics we think you might find of interest.</p>
    <p>
        Personally Identifiable Information collected by 3xconversionformula.com may
        also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,
        troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, and other communications
        with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation
        of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We
        will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time
        as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with
        other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among
        the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court
        order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law,
        in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement
        authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not
        provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>

    <h2>
        Affiliated Sites, Linked Sites And Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
        3xconversionformula.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to
        respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including
        our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through
        our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
        For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a
        frame on a 3xconversionformula.com page, certain content that is actually created
        or hosted by a third party. Also, through 3xconversionformula.com you may be
        introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests
        or sweepstakes offered by other parties. 3xconversionformula.com is not responsible
        for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable
        privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature
        or page operated by a third party.</p>
    <p>
        While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties
        may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences
        or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served
        by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine
        whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available
        on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or
        other technology to gather information. 3xconversionformula.com does not control
        the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is
        not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
    <p>
        You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable
        Information on message boards or in our forum, that information can be viewed publicly
        and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result
        in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities
        are beyond the control of 3xconversionformula.com and this policy.</p>

    <h2>
        Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of
        13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13,
        we will delete that information from our systems. 3xconversionformula.com encourages
        parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's
        online experience safer:</p>
    <p>
        Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or
        responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc.<br>
        Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.</p>
    <p>
        Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.
