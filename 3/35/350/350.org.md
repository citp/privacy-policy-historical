# Privacy Policy | 350.org

_Privacy Policy Last Updated on 12/12/12_

**General Policy:** 350.org has a firm commitment to internet privacy. You can visit most portions of 350.org without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect from a normal web site visit is the name of your internet service provider, the browser and type of machine you are using, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time you request them.

**How We Use the Information:  **We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity in order to improve the quality of our site to our visitors. We do encourage you to voluntarily share your email address and other personally identifiable information with us, because we can’t build the movement we need to win the fight against global warming without you. All such information is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data.

**Action and Signup Pages:  **We do not share the information you've given us on Action and Signup pages with unaffiliated groups or individuals without your explicit permission. For petitions, letters to the editor, and surveys you've signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to members of Congress, the President, or other targets specifically noted on the signup page. We will send you updates on the campaign you singed up for and other important campaigns by email. If a local leader starts a campaign or petition that you sign, they may access the information you have shared and follow up with you about local campaign updates.

**Account Creation:  **By registering an account/password/event for a "day of action", we may also create an account for you on the 350Local platform so you can easily manage future local events in your community.

**Security:** 350.org makes every effort to insure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies. If you choose to make a one-time donation to 350.org, your credit card information will be used only for this transaction through our secure online payment system. 350.org does not sell or otherwise disclose such user information outside the organization.

**Updates and Sharing of Information:** If you sign up to receive updates from 350.org, we commit to ensuring that we provide you accurate and timely information about our campaign activities. While the vast majority of communications will come to you direct from 350.org, information on our lists, such as your name and address, may be transferred to 350.org’s affiliate organization the 350.org Action Fund, or shared with other trusted 350.org allies in special cases -- such as organizing 350.org events in your area. We will not share your information with any individual who is not engaged in ensuring the success of 350.org, or any group that lacks a robust privacy policy.  You may opt out of our this communication at any time via the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email we send, or here: [www.350.org/unsubscribe](http://www.350.org/unsubscribe)

**Cookies:** Like most websites, 350.org may place a "cookie," or small file, in the browser files of a visitor’s computer. We use cookies to save information you give us so that you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. This allows us to personalize the site to your taste and provide the best web experience possible to our visitors. 

**Updating the Privacy Policy:** 350.org does reserve the right to change its policy as necessary to support the campaign; this privacy policy statement will always remain updated.
