**Safety in our Personnel:** Each 3WISHES.COM staff member is appropriately trained and updated about preventing, detecting, and monitoring fraudulent behavior.

We ensure that the right controls are in place each step of the sales order process because we are dedicated to bringing our customers’ a safe, worry-free, shopping experience.

 **Safety in our Technology:** Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. Wherever we collect sensitive information, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page. At 3WISHES.COM we seek to constantly improve our information technology security as fraudulent behavior seeks to become more elusive. Management reviews what types of information technology security can be improved, remodeled, and implemented to ensure our customers’ personal data is well protected.

 **Safety in our Procedures:** At 3WISHES.COM we take a dynamic approach to evaluating the data security implemented in our procedures. When our Employees or Security Applications detect even a hint of fraudulent activity, it is sent for a multi-level review. If our procedures conclude that there is significant risks with an order, we will contact our customers to assure it is not fraudulent activity. Through both information system and manual controls we minimize risks to guarantee our customers’ safe, shopping experience.
