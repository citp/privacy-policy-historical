    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>We at NuWire, Inc. appreciate you visiting NuWireInvestor.com. Your privacy is important
    to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online
    information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used on this website.</p>

    <h2>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
    <p>On NuWireInvestor.com, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise
    express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online magazine or
    participate in one of our online forums. The types of personally identifiable information
    that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone
    number, fax number, credit card information and information about your interests in
    and use of various products, programs and services.</p>
    <p>There are certain circumstances where you can submit information about other people.
    For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an article,
    a sponsored subscription or a promotional offer. The types of personally identifiable
    information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's
    name, address, e-mail address and telephone number.</p>
    <p>We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit
    many of our web pages, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet
    Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows Vista, Mac OS)
    and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., Verizon, AOL).</p>
    <h2>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for
    our products, programs and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings
    and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest
    to you.</p>
    <p>We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you
    when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our registration agreements,
    to fulfill a request by you for an online magazine or to contact you about your account
    with us.</p>
    <p>We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your
    gifts or free promotional items. From time to time, we also may use this information
    to offer our products, programs or services to them.</p>
    <p>The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is
    used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation
    in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products,
    programs or services.</p>
    <p>If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"),
    we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us. We sometimes
    use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design
    and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We
    also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to
    offer you products, programs or services.</p>
    <p>We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process,
    for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information
    in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary
    to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
    situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations
    of our terms of use or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information
    about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company.</p>
    <p>Agents and contractors of NuWire who have access to personally identifiable information
    are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy
    Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry
    out the services they are performing for NuWire.</p>
    <p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures
    of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we
    collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.</p>
    <p>NuWire will not disclose personally identifiable information to other companies (other
    than NuWire or any of its subsidiaries), unless: You request to have your personal information
    disclosed in order to receive additional information, promotional offers and/or follow
    up; and/or It is disclosed as part of an opt-in promotional offer that some of your
    personal information will be disclosed to another company.</p>
    <p>We may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to
    enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest
    to you. If you prefer not to receive marketing information from this site, you can opt
    out using the unsubscribe button at the bottom of any promotional e-mails. NuWire will
    not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated
    to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out
    of these unrelated uses.</p>
