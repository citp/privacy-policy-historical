For example, we may request your personal information (e.g., name, postal address, email address, DOB, telephone number, credit/debit card number, security code) or your applicable business information when you register for an account or purchase our Service. We may also collect any communications that you exchange with us, as well as any information you provide if you take part in any interactive features of the Service (e.g., promotions, surveys, etc.).  We collect information you may provide when providing content or commentary to our Service in the form of blog posts, comments, and the like, which may be published on our site and viewable by the public.
