# NuVox Communications

NuVox Communications is committed to your privacy and guards your data carefully. We realize that the exciting growth of the Internet and online services have also brought concern for consumers about what information is collected about them, and we want you to know that we apply that long-standing commitment to all of our online and Internet activities. 

Currently, NuVox does not share, disclose or sell any personally identifiable information collected at this site with other companies or organizations. In the future, should NuVox decide to share its customers' personal or transactional data with third parties, it will, in advance, provide notification and the opportunity for its users to indicate whether they would prefer that the company not provide the information to third parties. 

NuVox may collect some personally identifiable information when you are at this site such as your name, telephone number, or email address. NuVox may also include information about your visit in collective or aggregated data that does not identify you specifically. We use that information to help maintain accurate accounts, providing and changing service, billing, shipping, answering your inquiries, marketing services and products, and to help make our Web site useful to you: 

  * Our server recognizes your domain name and the pages that you visit. This data is gathered in an aggregate manner for quality control and improvement of our site. 
  * We collect your email address when you send email to us so that we can respond to your inquiry. 
  * We collect information that you volunteer to us on surveys, contest sites, and registration sites. 
  * We use your information to provide you with service, online customer service, billing, and fulfillment materials. (For example, we will use your postal address to provide you with software or calling cards you may request.) 
  * We do not market to children nor collect personal information about children at this site. 
  * We use strong technology to ensure your sensitive information is secure and is protected from unauthorized access or improper use. 



At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. NuVox has no control over the third parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so. 

When visitors or customers send email inquiries to NuVox, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. NuVox does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party. 

At any time, you may review or update the available personally identifiable information that we collect online by contacting NuVox at the address noted below. To better safeguard your information, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections in your information. NuVox has developed this privacy policy in accordance with current U.S. standards. 

We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if a third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. 

It is NuVox's policy not to use or share the personal information about visitors or customers in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, NuVox may disclose personal information about visitors or customers, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to comply with the law, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect NuVox and our customers. 

A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. NuVox may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a customer and have created your own personal start page, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit non-NuVox Web sites where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies.
