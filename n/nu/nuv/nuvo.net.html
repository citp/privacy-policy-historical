<span class="listkicker">PRIVACY POLICY</span><br><br>

<div id="text">
As of 11/05/05<br><br>
A detailed privacy policy follows, but the bottom line is this: NUVO will not sell or share
any of your personal information to a third party unless you say it's okay. NUVO will gather personally
identifiable information about you only when you provide it voluntarily for
specific purposes such as posting an ad or signing up for an e-mail newsletter.
Be a well-informed nuvo.net user by reading the details below, and check back
regularly for updates.<br><br>
Thank you for visiting Nuvo.net (the "Site"), a Nuvo, Inc. website. At NUVO ("NUVO",
"us", "we", or "our"), we recognize and respect
the importance of maintaining your privacy. We have established this Privacy
Policy (the "Privacy Policy") to inform you of the kinds of information
we may gather during your visit to the Site, why we gather customer
information, what we use the information for, under what circumstances we may
disclose such information, and how you can instruct us to limit the use of that
information.<br><br>
<b>By visiting the Site, you are accepting the practices described in this
Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please
do not use the Site and exit immediately. We reserve the right to modify or
amend the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice at any
time. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these
terms will mean that you accept those changes.</b><br><br>
If you
have any questions please <a href="mailto:webmaster@nuvo.net">e-mail
us</a>, or write us at 3951 N. Meridian St., Suite 200,
Indianapolis, IN 46208 with
comments or questions. See <a href="http://www.nuvo.net/misc/about/">about
NUVO</a> to find out more about <i>NUVO</i> and our policies.<br><br>
<b>1. What Information We Gather</b><br>
We do not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information about you except
when you provide it.<br><br>
<b><u>Classified Ads</u></b>:<br>
When you
place a classified ad on our Site, we will ask you for your e-mail address and
other information that allows respondents to contact you. We will not share
that information with any third party. You can choose to hide your personal
information from other Site users.<br><br>
<b><u>Newsletter</u></b>:<br>
NUVO collects email
addresses and zip codes of all users who subscribe to our weekly newsletter.
This information is not shared with any third parties for any purposes. Anyone
who wishes to no longer receive this newsletter can, at any time, click on the
"Unsubscribe" feature located within each newsletter.<br><br>
<b><u>Anonymous Use Information:</u></b><br>
We do collect anonymous information about all of our users, including the way
our users access the Site and the content. We analyze information to determine
how our users are making use of various parts of the Site, to improve the Site,
and so we can share "rating" information with our partners. This
information is typically shared on an aggregated basis and cannot be used to
identify individual Users.<br><br>
<b><u>Giveaways and Contests</u></b><br>
If you sign up to be eligible for a giveaway or contest on our Site, your
information will be shared with the advertiser or sponsor of that giveaway or
contest for one-time use to notify you if you have won. To the extent the
giveaway or contest has its own terms that conflict with the terms of this
Privacy Policy, the terms of the giveaway or contest shall govern. Personally
identifiable information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to
our sponsors or us.<br><br>
<b><u>Under 13</u></b>:<br>
We do not knowingly collect any information from persons under the age of
13. If we learn that any persons
under the age of 13 have provided information about themselves, the information
will be deleted. Our Site is designed for adults. Our Site is not intentionally
targeted to children under the age of 13.<u> Children under the age of 13
should not use our Site without obtaining prior parental consent</u>.<br><br>
<b><u>Co-Branded Services</u>:</b><br>
We work closely with our partners to offer co-branded services such as, the
online personals service provided by<b> Telepublishing International</b>. For privacy policies
governing these types of services, please see the separate privacy policies
within these sections. To the extent such policies conflict with the terms of
this Privacy Policy, the terms of such other policy shall govern.<br><br>
<b><u>Links to Other Sites</u>:</b><br>
Our Site contains links to other Web sites whose information practices may be
different than ours. Please be aware that when you click on links and/or advertisement
banners that take you to third-party Web sites, you will be subject to the
third parties' privacy policies, not ours. While we support the protection of
privacy on the Internet, we are not responsible for the actions and privacy
policies of third parties and other Web sites. We encourage you to read the
posted privacy statement and user terms and conditions whenever interacting
with, and prior to providing any personal information to, any other Web site.
This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by NUVO on this Site.<br>
<br>
<b>2. How We Use the Information We Gather</b><br>
The information collected is used internally by NUVO for four main
purposes: (1) To determine which areas, features, and products our users like
the most and find most helpful as part of our continuing efforts to improve our
Site; (2) To personalize the Site for our users (for example, if you have
indicated an interest in jazz, we may make you aware of upcoming jazz events);
(3) To enable our users to participate in sweepstakes, contests, services, and
other activities on our Site; and (4) to enable users to place classified
advertisements in designated areas of the Site. In all cases described below we
will not sell or share any personally identifiable information with any third
party without your consent.<br><br>
When we conduct user surveys to find out how we can improve our Site for you,
we may share aggregated non-personal information about our users with
advertisers or other third parties. For example, we might disclose that a certain
percentage of our users are female.<br><br>
We also use certain third-party advertising services (including, in particular,
Real Media) to display advertising for our advertisers. These third-party
services may place a cookie on your computer for the purposes of ad tracking
and presentation. (See "Cookies
and IP Addresses", below, if you're not sure what a cookie is.)<br><br>
We occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and joint
ventures that perform functions on our behalf, such as credit card processing,
shipping or stocking orders, providing customer service, managing user ids and
passwords, etc. They have access to personal information needed to perform
their functions, and are contractually obligated to maintain the
confidentiality and security of the data. They are restricted from using or
altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to
the Site.<br><br>
You can choose to electronically forward a story from our Site to a friend by
entering the friend's e-mail address. You can also request that we send an
email alert when your favorite columnist posts a column or when certain
classified ads are posted. We don't sell or share the addresses used in our<i>
E-mail This to a Friend</i> service or our alerts to any third-party.<br>
<br>
Please remember that any information you share in public areas, such as message
boards like <a href="http://www.nuvo.net/forums/"><b>Forums</b></a> or <a href="http://www.nuvo.net/classifieds/"><b>Online Classifieds
</b></a> sections, becomes
public, and therefore this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you
choose to make public. Please be careful about what you disclose and do not
post any personal information that you expect to keep private.

<br><br>
Some of our services require you to register for an account, such as Blogs or the
Music Community. We will ask you for
some personal information in order to create an account (typically your name,
email address and to establish a user id and password for your account) and we
will use that information in connection with providing these services.<br><br>
Please note that whenever you choose to share information in the public areas
of the Site, you grant us a license (as described in NUVO's
<a href="http://classifieds.nuvo.net/media/termsandconditions.cfm"><b>Classified Terms of Use</b></a>) 
to that information you publish. We occasionally will publish or
use in connection with promotional and/or marketing materials any posted
comments on our Site or feedback received via e-mail (especially if you say
nice things about us).<br><br>

<b>3. How We Use "Cookies" and IP Addresses</b><br>
<i>Cookies:</i> When you visit the Site, we send your computer a "cookie,"
a small data file that's stored on your hard drive. We use cookies to
understand Site usage and to give you better, more personalized service. You
are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but you may not
be able to take full advantage of our Site's features, and we recommend that
you leave them turned on. We do not install, or authorize the installation of,
web beacons, web bugs, "single-pixel gifs" or other types of spyware
on users' computers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Note:</b>
You will see advertising on our Site that originates with outside advertisers
and/or advertising agencies. In some cases, if you click on or view these ads,
the advertisers will assign a cookie for ad tracking and presentation purposes.
We are not responsible for nor have any control over these cookies.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<i>IP address tracking:</i> All computers and servers on the Internet use IP
addresses to recognize and communicate with each other.<i> The Voice</i> collects IP addresses
to administer and analyze our Site and report aggregate, non-personal information
(such as how many visitors we have). When you call up our Site on your
computer, our servers enter the IP address of that computer into a log. To
maintain our users' anonymity, we do not associate IP addresses with records
containing personal information.<br><br>

We do not and cannot use cookies or IP address tracking to retrieve personal
information from your computer.<br><br>
<b>4. Additional Circumstances When Information May be Shared</b><br>
In addition to what is stated above, we share customer information only under
the following, limited circumstances:<br><br>
We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we
in good faith believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law or
with legal process, protect and defend our rights and property, protect against
misuse or unauthorized use of the Site or protect the personal safety or
property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you
provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about
you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).<br><br>
Although your privacy is very important to us, in the existing legal regulatory
and security environment, we cannot fully guarantee that your personal
information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, under certain
circumstances the government or unrelated third parties might legally require
us to disclose information to them, or third parties might unlawfully intercept
or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the
unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or
inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information
about you to private entities and law enforcement or other government officials
as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.<br><br>

<b>5. Security</b><br>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
appropriate use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic and
managerial procedures to protect the information we collect. When our
registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as
credit card number), that information is encrypted with secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology
prior to transmission over the Internet.<br><br>

While we make reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal information once we
receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public
network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot ensure or
warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or information we
transmit to you from our Site, and you do so at your own risk.<br><br>

<b>6. Governing Law/ Sale of the Company</b><br>
Our Site is a published in the United States. U. S. law shall govern in any and
all disputes, including privacy or defamation issues or otherwise.<br><br>
In the event of a sale of NUVO or a sale of substantially all NUVO's assets, the email
database and all user information shall accrue to the new owners. So that the
services provided to our users may continue uninterrupted. Any such sales are
not anticipated to otherwise alter the basic terms of this Privacy Policy.

<br><br>
<b>7. Changes</b><br>
As our Site continues to develop, we may add new services and features to our
Site. In the event that these additions, changes to the law or changes to NUVO 
policy affect our Privacy Policy, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to
time. Please read this Privacy Policy each time you use our Site to be informed
of any such changes.
