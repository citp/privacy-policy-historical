**What information we know about you and how we use it:**  
Although we may collect certain information from you as discussed below, please be reassured of the following:  


  * We will not disclose your social security number or any other personal information you provide to us unless you authorize us to do so, except where needed to deliver a service or product ordered by you or under the limited circumstances set forth below.

  * We will always give you the opportunity to access and correct your personal information at any time.
  * We will not disclose your application status without your authorization.



**Personal information that you give us:**  
There are various areas on our Web site where we either require or permit you to transfer personal information. We use this personal information only for the purpose specified at the time you input such information, including contacting you for employment opportunities with us or our clients. For example, when using various features of our Web site we may collect your name, address, social security number, telephone number, email address, licensure, certifications, education and/or employment history. In addition, employees and applicants may use our secure The Service Connection section of this site to submit additional information in furtherance of employment.   


Information that we derive independently from your use of the site:  
Aside from any information you may actively disclose to us, there is other less obvious information that we might obtain from you. We may use such information for internal purposes such as to improve the content of our Web pages or to customize the layout of our pages for each individual according to their preferences. In addition, we may track your account history regarding your participation on the Web site.   


**Aggregate information:**  
Our system automatically collects information about the pages that visitors view on our Web site. We may use this aggregate information to understand how our members as a group use the services we provide so that we can improve our Web site. Furthermore, we may share such aggregate statistical information with our partners, affiliates or other outside companies, but in doing so, it is not our practice to disclose individual names or other personal information. Some examples of how we aggregate such information are as follows:   


**Cookies:**  
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are widely used on the Internet and have become an industry standard. Cookies enable user registration, login and personalization, among other things. Although a cookie cannot identify you personally, it can identify your computer. Your browser is most likely set up to accept cookies automatically. If you would like to disable this feature you may do so by adjusting the options or preferences in your browser. However, by doing so, you will lose some of the conveniences of our Web pages.   


**IP addresses:**  
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin service with an Internet Service Provider. We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of our site. Each time you log onto our site and each time you request one of our pages, our server logs your IP address. Although we log your session with us, we will not normally link your IP address to anything that can enable us to identify you. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, users or others.   


**Computer information:**  
We query your computer automatically for information about the computer or operating system you are using such as the baud rate of your modem or error messages you may have received. We may do so in order to fit our services to your individual needs and to diagnose problems you may be having with our Web site. We use a unique identifier in the form of a user ID to give you access to special areas of our Web site intended for registered users.   


**Geographic location:**  
We may gather information about your geographical location by determining where your computer is located. We do this in order to provide either localized service or to provide faster service by sending your server localized content.   


**Other information:**  
We may require other information for tracking or verifying compliance with our policies, abiding by federal, state and local laws and for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes. In addition, from time to time, we may use your information for unanticipated uses, such as notification of new services, announcements and general communications. If our information practices materially change at some time in the future, we will post such changes to the site before we use your data for these new purposes. If you are concerned about how your information is used, please periodically check this privacy policy.   


**How to access and change your user information:**  
We encourage you to correct and update information related to your account. Upon your request, we will provide you with any unique identifying or personal information that we maintain about you and will make any appropriate changes you provide us.   


**When we may be forced to disclose:**  
We may disclose user information in special cases when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property or the rights or property of our users or others. We also may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. Finally, in the event of a merger, sale of all or substantially all of American Mobile Healthcare's assets or a consolidation we reserve the right to transfer such personal information to a third party who agrees to abide by this Privacy Policy and use such personal information only for the purposes it was originally provided.   


**Opting-out:**  
If at any time you object to our use of your personal information, including use of your email address, you may stop that use by emailing your request to [contact@americanmobile.com](mailto:contact@americanmobile.com).   


**Security:**  
Security is a top priority for us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your Internet connection to our servers. We also take great care to protect user-information off-line. Only authorized personnel handle your data and our database servers have a backup system to prevent loss of data. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure and we will not be held liable should a third party illegally obtain your personal information. While we have made a great effort to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Our policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.   


**Your acceptance of these terms:**  
By using this site, you signify your assent to the American Mobile Healthcare privacy policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please refrain from using our site. Notice of any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this site. Your continued use of the American Mobile Healthcare site following a reasonable notice of changes to our privacy policy will mean you accept the changes. American Mobile Healthcare's privacy policy was effective as of July 1, 2004. It was last updated Sept. 15, 2005.
