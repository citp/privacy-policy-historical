nura privacy policy 

last updated:  25 May 2018 

As part of the nura community, you and your privacy are of high importance to us. Making the world's first headphones that automatically know how you hear is no easy feat. To achieve our vision of providing perfect sound for every person in any place, nura products collect and analyse your hearing data to create your personalised hearing profile. 

We also know that an amazing experience isn’t just about having a revolutionary product - it’s also about getting help when you need and making sure the process of ordering, receiving and using your nuraphones is as easy as possible. 

We want to make sure that you always know what information we collect and how we collect, use and share it. We have created this Privacy Policy to be transparent about our information practices and to keep you informed.

This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Nura Operations PTY, LTD. This Privacy Policy applies to information obtained from or in relation to nura products (“Products”), our mobile applications (“Apps”), and our websites ([www.nuraphone.com](http://www.nuraphone.com/) and sub-websites) (collectively, the “Sites”, and collectively with the Apps, the “Services”). 

Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you achieve your perfect sound, this Privacy Policy may change over time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification).  We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Products or Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

Remember, we’re here to help! If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, just reach out our [contact form](https://help.nuraphone.com/contact).

 **what data does nura collect?**

 **when you buy a product  **

When you purchase a Product, we collect transaction information, such as information about the Products you purchase, shipping and delivery information and information related to returns, refunds and cancellations. 

 **when you create a nura account**

When you access the nura App to calibrate your Product to your hearing, you will need to create a nura account. When you create your nura account, you’ll be prompted to enter personal information, including your name, email address, country, password, age, gender and any other information you provide. We use age and gender information to analyse hearing measurement trends, and as described in this Privacy Policy.

You may also have the option to create your nura account using your credentials from certain social media accounts, such as your Facebook or Google+ accounts. If you choose to do so, we may have access to basic information about you from that account, like your name, profile picture, and friend list, in accordance with your privacy settings on that service. 

 **when you calibrate a nura product  
** Calibration of nura Products involves collecting signals from your ear, including frequency responses and a measurement called Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE). nura analyses your hearing data -- the OAE and frequency responses-- to create calibration data that provides you with a personalised sound experience. The calibration data is stored locally on the Product so you can experience personalised sound day-to-day, without using the App. This hearing data is also sent to nura and used to optimize and develop nura products and services. 

 **when you sync your nura product**

Whenever your Product is connected to your device, and your device has a network connection, usage data is transferred from your nura Products to our servers. Usage data is information about how you use the Product, such as the duration of a listening session and the volume of the sound during that session. 

 **when you use our services**

Whenever anyone visits the nura Sites or Apps, we will collect standard log data, such as: the page that they were referred from, the actions they performed, their browser type, App version, their operating system and the pages viewed. We also collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.

 **when you refer your friends**

Great music should be shared with great friends! This is why nura lets you invite friends to receive a discount off their very own nura Products, while rewarding you too. When you invite your friends, you’ll be asked to provide details such as their name and email address. By providing such information, you represent that you have their permission to share their information with nura. 

 **when you interact with nura and the nura community**

In your pursuit for perfect sound, we encourage you to be active in the nura community. When communicating with the nura community in public areas or social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, any information you provide may become public information. At times nura will also collect and store this information to help improve your experience, learn more about your tastes as a nura community member, and for marketing purposes. 

We encourage you to take care when providing information in public forums, especially information that may pertain to your identity or health. Please also note that the content created by members of the nura community may include the advice and opinions of the general public - as these are not posted by nura, they do not represent the advice or opinions of nura and nura does not necessarily support or validate this content.

 **nura uses cookies and other similar technologies.  **

Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Products and Services, improve your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and to count visits. We use this data to learn more about your experience using the Services, so that we can constantly improve and personalise your nura experience. Such technologies are also used to help you move seamlessly between the nura App and Site without logging in. This may also be helpful when you are ordering more nura Products or contacting the nura team, as your information may be pre-filled. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see "Your Choices" below. 

 **when you contact the nura team**

There’s nothing more annoying than having to repeat yourself, so when you contact us, we collect personal information such as your name, email address, and any other information you provide. We keep a record of this information, along with the nature of your requests over time. This helps us learn more about your experience using nura Products, your preferences, and how we are best placed to help you. Storing and analysing this data, also helps us identify how to optimise and improve the nura experience for everyone. We may also monitor, record and retain your communications with us for security, dispute resolution and training purposes.    

 **when you assist nura’s research**

From time to time, the nura team will reach out to you for your advice and opinions on our Products and Services, for nura’s research purposes to improve our current Products and Services and develop new ones. Such surveys will only be sent by nura and authorised research affiliates - they will be clearly marked as for use by nura only, unless stated otherwise. Surveys may collect both anonymous and identifiable information.
