### Sharing with third parties

  *  _Service providers:_ We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under instruction from us, including abiding by policies and procedures designed to protect your information. You can learn more about third-party service providers in the section “Nuclino Subprocessors” below.

  *  _Third-party services:_ You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to link or integrate third-party services with our Services. Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those third-party services. Third-party service policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please disable or remove any undesired link or integration.

  *  _With your consent:_ We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so.

## How we store and secure the information

### Information storage and security

We use data hosting service providers to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data. You can learn more about services we use in the section “Nuclino Subprocessors” below. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. You can learn more about selected security measures [here](https://www.nuclino.com/security). We will respond to requests about information storage and security within a reasonable timeframe.

### How long we keep information

We may retain your personal information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection. For instance, we may retain your personal information during the time you have an account to use the Services, and for a reasonable period of time thereafter. We also may retain your personal information during the period of time needed for Nuclino to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## How to access and control your information

### Right to access and update information

Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account and search for content containing information about you using searches in the Service. You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.

In addition to the abilities we provide from within the Services, you may request to access or update your information using the contact information at the end of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and notify you of the action we have taken.

### Right to delete your information

In addition to the abilities we provide from within the Services, you may request to delete your information using the contact information at the end of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and notify you of the action we have taken.

### Right to restrict information processing

In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.

To exercise this right, please send us your request using the contact information at the end of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and notify you of the action we have taken.

### Right to data portability

Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another. Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to export certain information from within the Service. Should you request it by contacting us using the contact information at the end of this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and information under your sole control. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and notify you of the action we have taken.

## How we transfer the information we collect internationally
