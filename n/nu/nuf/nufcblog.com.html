			<div class="entry">		
				<p>The Newcastle United Blog knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting our website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers The Newcastle United Blog’s treatment of personal information that The Newcastle United Blog gathers when you are on the The Newcastle United Blog website and when you use The Newcastle United Blog services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that The Newcastle United Blog&nbsp;does not own or control, or to individuals that The Newcastle United Blog&nbsp;does not employ or manage.</p>
<p>Information Collected by The Newcastle United Blog</p>
<p>We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information from our The Newcastle United Blog&nbsp; users:</p>
<p>1. Information You Provide to Us:<br>
o &nbsp;We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.</p>
<p>2. Automatic Information:<br>
o &nbsp;We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. The Newcastle United Blog and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain “traffic data” on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, The Newcastle United Blog&nbsp;cookie information, and the page you requested. The Newcastle United Blog&nbsp;uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.<br>
o The Newcastle United Blog&nbsp;may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed.<br>
o Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While The Newcastle United Blog will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</p>

<p>Cookies</p>
<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. The Newcastle United Blog&nbsp;cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.</p>
<p>The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of &nbsp;The Newcastle United Blog’s coolest features.</p>
<p>The Newcastle United Blog’s advertising partners may place a cookie on your browser that makes it possible to collect anonymous non-personally identifiable information that ad delivery systems use to present more relevant ads.

Moreover, if The Newcastle United Blog, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.</p>
<p>Protection of The Newcastle United Blog and Others:</p>
<p>We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of The Newcastle United Blog, our employees, our users, or others.
