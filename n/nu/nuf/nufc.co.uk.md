** Newcastle United teams up with a selection of carefully chosen commercial partners, an up-to-date list of our commercial partners is available by [clicking here](https://www.nufc.co.uk/club/partners/current-partners).

Our commercial partner programme is designed to support the Club and also to bring customers, fans and website users a diverse range of opportunities and offers (including financial services offers) at competitive prices. Newcastle United and/or these commercial partners would like to contact you with details of offers in a number of ways, including post, telephone, text/picture/video message, digital television, fax or by email. Where you have provided us with consent to do so and you express an interest in an offer from one of our commercial partners, that partner may let us know. This enables us to take your views and interests into account when choosing our commercial partners and developing the programme.

**What to do if you do not want to receive details of offers  
** Please be assured, we will only contact you with details of offers if you have provided us with express consent to do so. You can also change your mind at any time and withdraw consent.

Please note, if you do withdraw your consent to receive information, we and/or our commercial partners will be unable to keep you informed of new services, products, events or special offers that may interest you and our ability to inform you of ticketing opportunities will be affected.
