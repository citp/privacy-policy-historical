**What information do we collect?**  
In order to provide you with services, we may collect personal information about you from our website, telephone conversations, emails and written and verbal communications. We may, for example, keep a record of your name, address, delivery address, email address and telephone number. We may also record details of any disability or health needs you may have at the time of booking an event or service which will take place at the stadium or any of our other premises to help to ensure your safety.

We may supplement the information that you provide with other information that we obtain from our dealings with you or which we receive from other organisations, for example, our commercial partners.

**How will we use your information?  
** All personal information that we obtain about you will be recorded, used, and protected by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this privacy policy. We will primarily use your personal information to provide our products and services to you and, for example:

  * to communicate with you in the event that any products or services you have requested are unavailable
  * for record keeping purposes - to improve the quality of our service
  * for market research
  * to track activity on our website
  * to understand your preferences so that we can improve the products or services we offer



We may also create an individual profile for you so that we can inform you of products, services, events or special offers that may be of interest to you.

You should be aware that if we are requested by the police or any other regulatory or government authority investigating suspected illegal activities to provide your personal details and/or information concerning your activities whilst visiting the site, we shall do so.

If we do transfer your personal information to other territories, we will take proper steps to ensure that your information is properly protected.

We understand that children will visit our website or interact with our content.  We encourage all persons under 13 to consult with their parents or legal guardian before interacting with our content or submitting information to us. Parents or legal guardians should supervise children when online.
