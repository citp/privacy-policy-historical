## IV. Identification procedures

N26 Bank is legally obligated to check your identity using a valid identification document within the framework of opening an account and to store specific information from the identification document. For this purpose, we offer you a Video-Ident procedure as well as a Post-Ident procedure.

### 1\. Video-Ident procedures

The execution of video identification is performed on behalf of N26 Bank by the service provider IDnow GmbH, Auenstr. 100, 80469 Munich (hereinafter: "IDnow"). Identity is thereby established by means of a web-based video identification procedure via an encrypted transmission path.

For this purpose, N26 Bank will transmit your personal data (first name and surname, date and place of birth, nationality, email address, sex, mobile telephone number, registered address, preferred language) to IDnow. IDnow will allocate a process number to these data, which will be communicated to you by N26 Bank and with which you can carry out the video identification. A secure video connection will be established between IDnow and your end device to enable the required direct visual contact. Thereupon, an employee of IDnow will check your identifying characteristics provided by us, on the basis of the identification document. To prove the proper execution of the Video-Ident procedure, the employee must be able to access the camera of your end device and take photographs of you and the front and rear sides of your personal identification document or the principal page of your passport. After taking the photograph of your identification document, the information on the photograph regarding height, eye colour and access number will be irrevocably blacked out by IDnow. This redacted photograph of your identification document will then be transmitted to N26 Bank. The telephone conversation held between you and the employee of IDnow will be recorded and stored for evidentiary purposes. The video image transmission will not be recorded. At the start of the video identification, the employee of IDnow will ask for your express consent to the taking of the photographs and the recording of the conversation. The data will be transmitted by IDnow to N26 Bank and deleted from the IDnow server within 90 days. If you do not wish for the creation of photographs or recordings, we request that you use the Post-Ident procedure for identification confirmation. 

During the video identity confirmation, IDnow must ensure the authenticity of the personal identity document or passport presented by you. Additionally, the employee of IDnow must properly visually inspect the integrity of the identification document and the respective optical security features of the identification document. The IDnow employee will also ask you to read out the complete serial number on your identification document. 

To conclude the Video-Ident procedure, IDnow will send you a TAN via SMS, which you shall please confirm via the input field provided, upon request by the employee of IDnow.

### 2\. Post-Ident procedure

The Post-Ident procedure is carried out by Deutsche Post AG (hereinafter: "Deutsche Post") on behalf of N26 Bank. With the Post-Ident procedure, you can have the identity check carried out in your local post office.

We will send you an email with a coupon. Please bring a printout of the coupon (with individual reference number for internal assignment of the identification documentation) together with your personal identity document or your passport and certificate of registration to the nearest post office branch. Please note that this service is only offered in branches of Deutsche Post; parcel offices or postal agencies may not offer this service.

The postal employee will then transfer the data from your identification papers into the coupon. You must subsequently check these data and sign the coupon. This signature will be confirmed by the postal employee with a signature and stamp and sent to N26 Bank. 

## V. Credit check and data transmission to the SCHUFA

When you open an account with N26 Bank ("Sign-Up"),when granting an overdraft facility and when granting an instalment loan (N26 Credit - see section III 6.),we will transmit your data to the SCHUFA for the purpose of a creditworthiness check. This transmission shall only take place if you have previously expressly consented to N26 Bank performing a creditworthiness check with the SCHUFA. 

Furthermore, N26 Bank shall transmit to the SCHUFA the data of its customers concerning the substantiation, proper execution and termination of the overdraft facility agreement and your instalment loan, unless the legitimate interests of the customer in excluding the transmission obviously outweigh the interests of the SCHUFA in acquiring the data.

The SCHUFA will store and use the data received. This use also comprises the calculation of a probability value for evaluating the credit risk (Score) based on the SCHUFA database. The SCHUFA shall transmit the data received to its contractual partners in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, in order to provide them with information for evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals. Contractual partners of the SCHUFA are companies which bear financial default risks based on performances or deliveries (particularly banks and credit card and leasing companies, but also, for example, rental, retail, telecommunications, energy supply, insurance and debt collection companies). The SCHUFA shall only make personal data available if a justified interest in this has been credibly presented in the individual case and the transmission is permissible in consideration of all interests. Therefore, the scope of the respective data made available may differ depending on the type of contractual partner. Furthermore, the SCHUFA shall use the data to check the identity and age of persons, upon request by their contractual partners, which for example offer services on the internet.

Otherwise, N26 Bank will only transmit data to the SCHUFA concerning existing outstanding debts of their customers in the cases legally governed under § 28a para. 1 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). 

In addition, we will also transmit data to the SCHUFA concerning other non-contractual conduct (e.g. fraudulent behaviour). Under the Federal Data Protection Act (§ 28 paragraph 2),these reports are only permitted to the extent that they are necessary to protect our legitimate interests or those of third parties, and there is no reason to believe that your legitimate protectable interests in excluding the transmission outweigh them. To that extent, at the same time you release us from our duty of banking secrecy.

You are entitled to demand information from the SCHUFA concerning the data stored there about you. Further information about the SCHUFA information and score procedure is retrievable at [www.meineschufa.de](http://www.meineschufa.de/). The postal address of the SCHUFA is: SCHUFA Holding AG, Privatkunden Servicecenter, Postfach 103441, 50474 Köln.
