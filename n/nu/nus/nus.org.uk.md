**nusonline.co.uk Privacy Policy**

The nusonline website is operated by the National Union of Students. The NUS are committed to protecting your privacy when you are using its online services. To protect your privacy, we apply five principles which you can read about here. 

**Principle 1 - Notice**

We will ask for personal information which identifies you and enables you to be contacted, and about your course. 

We will use the information only for the following purposes: 

  * To send you newsletters from nusonline and details of new student promotions as they become available
  * To improve the content, design and layout of the nusonline website and to facilitate knowledge management
  * To carry out research on the demographics, interests and behaviour of our registered users
  * To perform marketing and promotional activities
  * To forward information to you which we feel you may find useful, such as details of products and services and forthcoming career/job opportunities.



Either of us may pass your personal information to the constituent member unions of the NUS and to other selected organisations which may also use it for these purposes. We may also register you for our other services which we feel may be useful or of interest to you. 

This privacy policy only covers the nusonline website at http://www.nusonline.co.uk 

Other links within this site to other websites or framed third party sites within nusonline are not covered by this policy. We may continue to use your personal information for a period after you cease being a registered user. 

**Principle 2 - Consent and Choice**

If you choose not to register or not provide personal information, you may still visit the nusonline website but you will not be able to access the restricted areas available to registered users. By clicking on "next" during the registration process, you accept the Terms and Conditions described herein and consent to our using your information accordingly. 

**Principle 3 - Access**

We have provided an administration service where you can review your personal information at any time to ensure it is correct and current. You will be able to update, correct, change or delete inaccurate details. 

You may also change your choice of opting in or out of direct marketing activities, although you may continue to receive mailings for a short period while your change is being processed. You have the right to ask for a copy of your personal information on payment of a small fee. 

**Principle 4 - Security**

We have taken appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information is not unlawfully processed. However, no information transferred over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We will not be transferring your personal information outside of the European Economic Area. This website may use cookies containing temporary session information. 

Cookies are a means of storing information about you and your preferences on the 

hard drive of the computer you are using. 

**Principle 5 - Minors**

The nusonline website is not intended for children and we ask that no-one under the age of 12 submits personal information to us or uses the site without supervision of a parent or guardian. Registered nusonline users under the age of 18 will, at most, receive limited direct marketing communications. 

**Questions**

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, or the use of your personal information, or if you wish to request us to stop using your information in any way, please write to:
