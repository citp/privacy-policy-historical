_How we protect your information_**

_Thanks for following our link to find out more about what we are doing to look after your personal information._

_NUS Services is part of the National Union of Students. NUS is one of the oldest student organisations in the world, and we work hard every day to help to make your experience as a student the best it can be. We influence national and local policies in areas that are important to you, such as accommodation, fees and the right to study. We also run ground breaking programmes to drive change, such as improving environmental impact and reducing alcohol abuse._

_We know that when you pass your personal details to us, you are trusting us to keep them safe, and we will do everything within our power to do this. We cannot promise to don capes and red underpants and turn into super-heroes, but we promise to do everything in our power to protect your data so that no villains can get access to it. We operate in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)._

_To offer you some incredible deals we do share your information with other companies, but we are very careful who we accept as partners. For an organisation to be an official partner they must prove that they have the best interests of you in mind, and that they are honest and ethical. Only if they pass these integrity checks will we share your information, and even then, only if you give us permission in the first place. You can also ask us to stop sharing your information at any time. We believe in transparency and further on we have listed the partners we currently work with._

_We want you to feel confident knowing that when you pass your details on to us they will be safe and protected. If we have not made anything crystal clear, or you would like to know anything else, just get in touch, we will be happy to answer any questions you may have._

**_The technical bits_**
