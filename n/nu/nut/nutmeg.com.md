**Password and Passcode**   
Do not give your device security details, including any passwords or passcodes, to anyone else and don't store them on your device. Get in touch with us as soon as possible if you feel someone may know your login details or if you lose your device. We can then stop the service to your device. 

For added security, we recommend you should set up a passcode to access your mobile device. This option can usually be found under the Settings menu on your device and set up multi-factor authentication via your Nutmeg dashboard

Multi-factor authentication requires something you are, or something you have in addition to the password when you authenticate a log in to Nutmeg.

Access Nutmeg using the best security offered by your browser to maintain the security of your account, this for example would be "incognito" for Google Chrome and "private browser" for Safari.

Do not leave your device unattended when logged on and watch out for people looking over your shoulder. Think carefully before jail-breaking or rooting your device. We advise against doing this as it may weaken the security of your device and expose you to additional risks. 

If possible, keep your mobile device’s operating system updated with the latest security patches and upgrades. Older software may have security vulnerabilities that could expose you to additional risks. You may also want to consider using a reputable brand of anti-virus software on your mobile banking device.

**When Nutmeg contacts you**   
We will never contact you to ask you to disclose your security credentials. Be cautious about opening links contained in SMS messages or emails and beware of phishing scams. 

Phishing scams are attempts by scammers to trick you into giving out personal information such as your bank account numbers, passwords and credit card numbers.
