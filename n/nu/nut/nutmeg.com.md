###  Security 

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure.  In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.

**Sophisticated encryption**   
When you use Nutmeg’s website or mobile app, data is transferred from your device to us. We use advanced encryption technology to keep your data secure.

You will automatically be logged out of Nutmeg’s website or mobile app if you are inactive for a prolonged period of time. 

**Fraud**   
Nutmeg has robust fraud screening processes to mitigate and detect fraud. 

**Authentication**   
Nutmeg’s mobile apps are protected by a passcode. Nutmeg’s iOS app is compatible with Apple Touch ID. 

  


### Recommendations

There is also a lot that you can do to help us keep your account safe. We recommend that you take the following actions:

**Password and Passcode**   
Do not give your device security details, including any passwords or passcodes, to anyone else and don't store them on your device. Get in touch with us as soon as possible if you feel someone may know your login details or if you lose your device. We can then stop the service to your device. 

For added security, we recommend you should set up a passcode to access your mobile device. This option can usually be found under the Settings menu on your device.

**Your handset**   
Don't leave your device unattended when logged on and watch out for people looking over your shoulder. Think carefully before jail-breaking or rooting your device. We advise against doing this as it may weaken the security of your device and expose you to additional risks.

If possible, keep your mobile device’s operating system updated with the latest security patches and upgrades. Older software may have security vulnerabilities that could expose you to additional risks. You may also want to consider using a reputable brand of anti-virus software on your mobile banking device.

**When Nutmeg contacts you**   
We will never contact you to ask you to disclose your security credentials. Be cautious about opening links contained in SMS messages or emails and beware of phishing scams. 

If you use Nutmeg’s mobile app, we recommend that you take these additional measures:

**Passcode and TouchID**   
Your Nutmeg app is protected by a passcode. We recommend that if you use Nutmeg’s iOS app, you use Apple Touch ID with the app. 

**App store**   
Only download mobile apps from official app stores. 

**Push notifications**   
If you choose to receive push notifications on your device, please be vigilant about who might be able to view the notifications when they appear on your device lock screen.
