# Privacy Policy - British Nutrition Foundation

**Information we collect and how it is used**

The British Nutrition Foundation does not capture and store any personal information about individuals who access this web site, except (1) where you voluntarily choose to give us your personal details via email or the feedback form, or by enquiring about or ordering any of our services or publications; (2) register for an event; and/or (3), where you subscribe to one of our newsletters.

For publications, training and events, the data supplied is only used by BNF to process and fulfil the order (as it is a contract with BNF). Data is stored securely on [nutrition.org.uk](http://nutrition.org.uk/) and is accessed only by authorised BNF staff to process and fulfil the order. After two years, completed orders are deleted from nutrition.org.uk.  Data collected is not used for any other purpose than fulfilling the order received. BNF uses PayPal as its payment merchant. The privacy policy for PayPal can be found [here](https://www.paypal.com/en/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full). 

When individuals register for BNF newsletters, the data supplied is only used by BNF to send specific newsletters, e.g. BNF News or BNF Education News. Newsletters contain information such as nutrition news and updates, education news, new or updated BNF resources, events and training opportunities. Individuals can view and update their information via a link in the newsletter email, as well as unsubscribe at any time. Registration for newsletters is via Your Mailing List Provider ([click here](https://www.ymlp.com/terms-of-service.html) for their terms of service and [data policy](https://www.ymlp.com/help.html?id=NjI1)).

We do not pass any of your personal information to outside organisations and/or individuals, except with your express consent (for example, if you register for BNF Healthy Eating Week and consent for your address to be used to send you posters). Data shared is encrypted. (For BNF Healthy Eating Week, registration is via Google Forms – [click here](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/compliance/#?modal_active=none) for their business and data compliance.)
