<br>
<h3>What we do with the information we gather</h3>

<p>We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reason</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Internal record keeping.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We may use the information to improve our products and services.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We may periodically send promotional messages about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the contact information which has been provided to us.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes. &nbsp;We may contact you by email, phone, fax or mail. We may use the information to customise the website according to your interests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From time to time, we may send customer data to third party companies with whom Nutmeg has a legal relationship, so that Nutmeg can analyse the impact of its products and services. Nutmeg will not sell any confidential customer data to third parties.</p>
</li>

<br>
<h3> Security&nbsp;</h3>

<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. &nbsp;In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.</p>

<p><strong>Sophisticated encryption</strong>
<br>
When you use Nutmeg’s website or mobile app, data is transferred from your device to us. We use advanced encryption technology to keep your data secure.
</p>

<p><strong>Automated logout</strong>
<br>
You will automatically be logged out of Nutmeg’s website or mobile app if you are inactive for a prolonged period of time.
</p>

<p><strong>Fraud</strong>
<br>
Nutmeg has robust fraud screening processes to mitigate and detect fraud.
</p>

<p><strong>Authentication</strong>
<br>
Nutmeg’s mobile apps are protected by a passcode. Nutmeg’s iOS app is compatible with Apple Touch ID.
</p>


<br>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>There is also a lot that you can do to help us keep your account safe. We recommend that you take the following actions:</p>

<p><strong>Password and Passcode</strong>
<br>
Do not give your device security details, including any passwords or passcodes, to anyone else and don't store them on your device. Get in touch with us as soon as possible if you feel someone may know your login details or if you lose your device. We can then stop the service to your device.
</p>

<p>For added security, we recommend you should set up a passcode to access your mobile device. This option can usually be found under the Settings menu on your device.</p>

<p><strong>Your handset</strong>
<br>
Don't leave your device unattended when logged on and watch out for people looking over your shoulder. Think carefully before jail-breaking or rooting your device. We advise against doing this as it may weaken the security of your device and expose you to additional risks.</p>

<p>If possible, keep your mobile device’s operating system updated with the latest security patches and upgrades. Older software may have security vulnerabilities that could expose you to additional risks. You may also want to consider using a reputable brand of anti-virus software on your mobile banking device.</p>

<p><strong>When Nutmeg contacts you</strong>
<br>
We will never contact you to ask you to disclose your security credentials. Be cautious about opening links contained in SMS messages or emails and beware of phishing scams. 
</p>

<br>

<p>If you use Nutmeg’s mobile app, we recommend that you take these additional measures:</p>

<p><strong>Passcode and TouchID</strong>
<br>
Your Nutmeg app is protected by a passcode. We recommend that if you use Nutmeg’s iOS app, you use Apple Touch ID with the app. </p>

<p><strong>App store</strong>
<br>
Only download mobile apps from official app stores.
</p>

<p><strong>Push notifications</strong>
<br>
If you choose to receive push notifications on your device, please be vigilant about who might be able to view the notifications when they appear on your device lock screen.
</p>

<h3>How we use cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. &nbsp;Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. &nbsp;Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. &nbsp;The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.</p>

<p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. &nbsp;This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. &nbsp;We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.</p>

<p>Nutmeg also uses cookies to track campaigns from banner advertisements and opt-in emails. We may  use third-party providers to help us determine which of our advertisements are most likely to be of interest to you. These providers may use behavioural information, such as how you navigate the internet, to provide relevant advertisements to you.</p>

<p>We also allow some of these companies to use tracking pixels. Tracking pixels may be used to collect and store information about visits to our website, such as which pages you viewed and how long you spent on the website, as well as the specific advertisement that you clicked to visit our site. No personally identifiable information is stored on these cookies or web pixels. The information reported to us is aggregated and anonymous. We use this information to understand, for example, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing.</p>

<p>Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. &nbsp;A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.</p>

<p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. &nbsp;Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. &nbsp;This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>

<br>
