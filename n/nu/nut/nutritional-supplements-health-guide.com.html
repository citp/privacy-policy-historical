<p>Nutritional-Supplements-Health-Guide.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of 
Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. 
We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, 
street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. 
We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third 
party. Period."</p>
<b>
<p>How we gather information from users</p>
</b>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 
the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For 
example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to 
certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or 
when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in 
sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive 
areas of our site. Like most Web sites, Nutritional-Supplements-Health-Guide.com also collects 
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be 
transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet 
Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information 
from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and 
password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you 
visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular 
advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may 
also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose 
not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to 
refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain 
portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, 
and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features according to your 
preferences.</p>
<b>
<p>What we do with the information we collect</p>
</b>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and 
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and 
do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) 
may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your 
usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help 
enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or 
what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be 
shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does 
not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to 
identify you individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on Nutritional-Supplements-Health-Guide.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization 
preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products 
offered by Nutritional-Supplements-Health-Guide.com and other topics we think you might find of 
interest. </p>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by Nutritional-Supplements-Health-Guide.com may 
also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site 
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, 
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. 
Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our 
site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will 
use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as 
we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with 
other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be 
among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response 
to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to 
do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, 
and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or 
necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in 
such cases.</p>
<b>
<p>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</p>
</b>
<p>Nutritional-Supplements-Health-Guide.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to 
respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, 
including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers 
accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection 
policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link 
to, or view as part of a frame on a Nutritional-Supplements-Health-Guide.com page, certain content 
that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through 
Nutritional-Supplements-Health-Guide.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web 
sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. 
Nutritional-Supplements-Health-Guide.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third 
parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties 
when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third 
parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your 
preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our 
advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the 
advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. 
Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third 
parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
Nutritional-Supplements-Health-Guide.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the 
resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of 
such third parties.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally 
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information 
can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without 
our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or 
third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Nutritional-Supplements-Health-Guide.com 
and this policy.</p>
