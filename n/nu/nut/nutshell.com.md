By use of the Product, you agree (1) to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and (2) Nutshell may process (i.e., collect, use, etc.) your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy or the User Agreement. Personal Data may be processed by Nutshell in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States).

### How Nutshell Uses Information

#### Personal Data

We will not sell or market the email addresses or other collected personal information of registered Users to third parties. We will not distribute, sell, or barter any data that you upload into the Product. We may view your Nutshell instance data and uploaded information to provide system maintenance and technical support only. You acknowledge and agree that Nutshell may occasionally send you communications regarding your account or the Product via email.

By submitting your email address to access content resources on Nutshell.com, you agree to receive future communications from Nutshell related to sales and CRM education, including newsletters, special offers, and notices of upcoming events hosted by Nutshell.

#### Cookies and Passive Data Collection

Nutshell uses cookie, IP address, GPS location, URL information and other technical connection details to improve and further develop the Product, and to provide enhanced or geographically differentiated features and Product levels to Users, where available.

Nutshell uses cookies to save User screen names, session validators, and on Users’ browsers and hard drives, and may use them to provide tailored Product features to those Users, as they become available. Nutshell may also use cookies to provide retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with the Product. We promise that our retargeting partners will never collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address, or telephone number.

IP Addresses also help us diagnose network congestion, problems with our servers and otherwise assist in the administration and delivery of the Product to our Users.

### User Information Nutshell Collects

#### Personal Data

Once you register with Nutshell and sign in to the Product, you are not anonymous to Nutshell.

When registering with Nutshell, you provide Personal Data, which may include company name, industry, number of employees, phone number, your title, city, state, country, zip code, a user name, confirmed email address, and a password. Nutshell does not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13. Nutshell may also record your IP address when you submit information.

Nutshell also may collect, at your option, certain preference and demographic information from you. All information collected by Nutshell is used for internal purposes of providing the Product, providing support to users, and to improve the Products. Aggregating non-identifying information supplied by users allows Nutshell to understand its user base and to improve the Products.

To protect your account information, please keep your password secure.

#### Cookies and Passive Data Collection

Nutshell automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request. Nutshell utilizes Google Analytics to analyze trends with non-personally-identifiable data.

Users should be aware that other websites visited before entering the Nutshell websites might place Personal Data within a User’s URL during a visit to their website, and Nutshell has no control over such websites. Accordingly, some of this information may be logged by Nutshell.

#### Links to Third Party Sites

Nutshell websites may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the websites. We have no responsibility for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.

#### Google Analytics

Nutshell uses Google Analytics to track usage of the Nutshell application and nutshell.com. Nutshell may use anonymized demographic and interest-based data from visitors to influence how we purchase advertising. Using the Ads Settings, users can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads.

We do not share any data that you add to your Nutshell account with Google.

### Disclosures

#### Nutshell Service Providers

Nutshell uses certain third-party service providers to improve your experience. For example, when you file a support ticket, we will transmit a minimal amount of your Personal Data (e.g. your email address) to our support software provider. These third parties will be required to adhere to Safe Harbor Privacy Principles or, at a minimum, Nutshell will require the third party to certify they follow privacy protection equal to Nutshell’s.

Your credit card data is stored and processed with PCI-compliant providers.

#### Legal Requirements

Nutshell does not disclose Personal Data, including the data you enter or upload into the Product, unless disclosure is necessary to comply with an enforceable government request such as a warrant.

#### Change of Ownership

In the event of a change in ownership, or a direct merger or acquisition with another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of Nutshell User information, including Personal Data, to a separate entity. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you (by posting on www.nutshell.com or via an email sent to the email address you provide) of any change in ownership, merger or acquisition of Nutshell’s assets by a third party.

#### Security

All of your Personal Data, stored by Nutshell or otherwise, is considered confidential and private. Appropriate industry standard administrative, physical, and technical safeguards will be maintained by Nutshell to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

Nutshell shall not: (a) Intentionally modify your Personal Data, (b) Disclose your Personal Data except as compelled by law or as expressly permitted in writing by you, or (c) Access your Personal Data except to provide maintenance, verification, or prevention of technical problems, associated with the Product or to provide technical support at your request.

Nutshell takes reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems but does not expressly make any guarantee these security measures will prevent third-parties from obtaining Personal Data by illegal actions or attacks. Should such an attack be perpetrated, Nutshell will supply authorities with available information on the third party when such event comes under prosecution.

#### Passwords

It is your responsibility to choose secure passwords and to keep them safe. Nutshell cannot be responsible for Personal Data that is compromised due to an insecure or stolen user password. If you are authenticating with Nutshell via a third-party (e.g. Google Apps), those passwords must also be secured.

### Updating or Removing User Information

You may, at any time, choose to correct or update the information you have submitted to Nutshell by updating your account on our website or in the Product. If you cancel your account, your Personal Data and other information may be retained in our archive or backup records.
