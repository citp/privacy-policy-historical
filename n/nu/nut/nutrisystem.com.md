# Privacy Policy | Nutrisystem®

This Privacy Policy will tell you what information Nutrisystem ("Nutrisystem," "we," or "us") collects when you and others visit and interact with our website at Nutrisystem.com ("Site") and use our mobile application ("application," or "app") on a mobile device ("Device"), how we use it and what choices you have about how that information is used. We collect information from you and other users in connection with the provision of our weight loss services and programs (collectively, "Services"). 

We urge you to read our entire Privacy Policy so that you will understand both our commitment to you and your privacy, and how you can participate in that commitment. 

## I. Information You Voluntarily Provide

When you interact with our Site, for example, placing an order, creating an account and/or profile, or purchasing a subscription on our Site, we may collect your name, email address, mailing address, contact numbers, age, height, weight, credit card number, and expiration date. The personally identifiable information we collect when you place an order, create an account and/or profile or purchase a subscription on our Site may be used for the purposes outlined in this policy, including:

### Information Provided in Optional Surveys

Nutrisystem periodically asks members to participate in online surveys or fill out online questionnaires concerning topics such as the effectiveness of the weight loss program, advertising effectiveness and customer satisfaction. All surveys and questionnaires are optional and the information collected will not be associated with any user’s personal information. Information gathered may be shared with third parties in order to improve customer satisfaction and program effectiveness. No personal information of any user will be connected to survey or questionnaire results. 

### Other Information You May Voluntarily Provide

From time to time, Nutrisystem collects third-party email addresses or other contact information from our users and customers so that Nutrisystem may send information to their friends and family on an as-requested basis. For example, Nutrisystem collects email addresses when a customer provides us with that information so that we may send out Referral Coupons. We also require the same when users utilize certain functions such as "email this to a friend" features. 

In addition, from time to time, Nutrisystem may make and/or offer new products and services available for users which may involve different privacy practices, which such practices will be disclosed to users at that time.

## II. Information Collected Automatically

We also collect non-personally identifiable information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Site. This information may be used for our business purposes. We may link this information to personally identifiable information for these and other purposes, including personalizing your experience on our Site. Information is also collected when you use our app Handheld Products, including the software application needed to utilize the Handheld Products on your handheld device (the "Application"). During the installation of the Application and subsequent synchronizations, we collect non-personally Identifiable Information concerning your device (such as the specific type of operating system and hardware you have, and the amount of free and total memory) and the Application’s files on your device. 

Our Handheld Products also collect information about your usage of the Application (such as the dates you last synced with the Internet or the dates you last used certain features). When you sync your device with the Website, we store some of this information. 

### Cookies

When you use our Site, we gather web traffic information via "cookies". Cookies are small pieces of digital information stored by your browser on your computer and tracks initial and returning visits, browsing patterns on our site, and products ordered and viewed. Our cookies do not contain personally identifying information, but they enable us to identify you as a repeat visitor and help us personalize your nutrisystem.com experience. Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar. You need to have cookies enabled on your computer in order to use our site. If you do not accept cookies to use our Website, you may not be able to use certain resources or features of our Website.

### Flash Cookies

Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Website. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies, and they are not placed on your computer. 

### Web Beacons, Pixel Tags, and 3rd Party Cookies

Nutrisystem, or third parties engaged by us, may use web beacons on some pages of this site. A web beacon (also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF) is a graphic image which is used to better understand the browsing patterns of visitors to the page. 

When the HTML code for the web beacon points to a site to retrieve the pixel image, information can be passed along such as the IP address of the computer that requested the image, the time the web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that was used, and previously set cookie values. Web beacons DO NOT pass or read personally identifiable information about you. 

Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies set by trusted third parties that are used to assess the effectiveness of particular promotional campaigns or to optimize advertising once a user leaves a website. View your browser’s help section to determine how to configure your browser to reject or manage first-party (i.e., Nutrisystem) and/or third-party cookies. Nutrisystem shares aggregated information collected through web beacons to vendors for which the beacon was set to determine the success of marketing campaigns, but does not disclose personally identifying information to these vendors. 

Third-party ad servers may track anonymous website usage through web beacons on our Site and other websites. They do this by setting a cookie (or reading a cookie previously placed by them) on users’ computers to track the activities of users who view a web page that contains web beacons. Third-party ad servers may use information about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Periodically, upon our request, third-party ad servers may report the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf back to us for our internal use and analysis and our treatment of this anonymous data is governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy. To learn more about targeted advertising, these providers, or how you may opt out, please visit the DAA’s consumer choice page at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>. Technologies other than http cookies may be used by third-parties in a similar way, to recognize the email recipients’ computer or device and to keep track of which user identities match to which devices or browsers, and those technologies may not respond to browser settings that block conventional cookies. You may opt out of many of these types of technologies by visiting the NAI’s opt out page at [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). 

### How we respond to "DO NOT TRACK" signals

We do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide you the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. 

We may use cookies and web beacons for insight with respect to the usage of the Site, and so that we could continually improve our customer’s experience. At times, we use third-parties to analyze usage of our website. However, we do not disclose your personally identifiable information to such third-parties. 

## III. What Nutrisystem Does With Your Information

### How does Nutrisystem protect customer information?

Protecting your information from unauthorized disclosure is important to us. We use the industry standard technology to protect the security of your information.

Unfortunately, no data transaction over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 

### Will Nutrisystem disclose the information it collects to outside parties?

Nutrisystem shares your information (other than payment information) with third-party vendors for shipping and billing purposes and with other third-parties that provide a service for Nutrisystem to help us operate our business and the Site and administer activities on our behalf.

If you opt-out of promotional or newsletter emails from Nutrisystem, we may continue to send you certain communications such as service announcements and administrative messages, relating to Nutrisystem that are necessary to our relationship with you.

In addition to what we have described above, Nutrisystem may also disclose your personal information to third-parties in certain limited circumstances, as follows 

  1. as necessary if we believe that there has been a violation of our site [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/jsps_hmr/terms/index.jsp), of the law, of our rights or of any third party; 
  2. to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law; and 
  3. to share your account information with other members of your household.

You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity’s planned use or sharing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

### Mobile Devices/Third-Party Fees

From time to time, we may make mobile device applications and mobile marketing campaigns available to you and may allow you to register for services that involve push notifications and/or emails being sent to your mobile device. You are responsible for obtaining access to the mobile device services. Such access may involve third-party fees, including mobile carrier, text messaging, or airtime charges. You are solely responsible for those fees, including any and all fees associated with the use of the applications, delivery of the messages, emails or other materials to your mobile device. Please consult your mobile service provider's pricing plan prior to purchasing or downloading any application or registering for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving push notifications or emails from/to your mobile device. You will be given the opportunity to opt-in to receive push notifications or emails to your mobile device at the time you register for the campaign and with each message or email you receive. To stop receiving push notifications or emails from NuMi, please change your communication settings in the NuMi® app or at NuMi.com. 

### Our Bulletin Boards, Social Media Pages, Chat Rooms & User Blogs

As part of our Services, we may provide support through bulletin boards, chat rooms (support groups), social media pages, The Leaf and blogs (collectively, "Forums"). Forums give our customers the opportunity to interact with each other. Forums are moderated to help keep inappropriate messages from being posted. You are offered the opportunity to include your email address with your message, but you are not obligated to do so. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information through or on these Forums your information can be viewed, collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in a Forum that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. We cannot control the actions of any third-parties. By posting any comments, pictures or other information ("Content") in a Forum hosted by us, you grant us a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual and worldwide right to copy and post both such Content within our Site, and those of our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, assigns, agents and licensees and any social media outlets and advertising medium through which we are engaged or elsewhere on the Nutrisystem Site, without any further notice to you or any remuneration therefore.
