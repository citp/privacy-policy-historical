<h2>Information Collected Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies</h2>

<p>As you navigate through and interact with our Website, we use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information.</p>
<p>We also use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (“interest-based advertising”). See “<i>Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Personal Information</i>” below for information on how you can opt out of behavioral tracking on this Website and how we respond to web browser signals and other mechanisms that enable consumers to exercise choice about behavioral tracking. The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Cookies (or browser cookies)</strong>. Cookies are small text files that are stored in your web browser or downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie, and allow a website to recognize a user’s device.
		<p>We currently use the following types of cookies:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Cookies that are strictly necessary</i>: These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website. These include, for example, cookies that enable a user to log in to our Website and to check if a user is allowed access to a particular service or content.</li>
			<li><i>Analytical cookies</i>: These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of users and to see how users use and explore our Website. These cookies help us to improve our Website, for example by ensuring that all users are able to find what they are looking for easily.</li>
			<li><i>Functionality cookies</i>: These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience on our Website. This type of cookies allows us to recognize you when you return to our Website and to remember, for example, your choice of language.</li>
			<li><i>Targeting cookies</i>: These cookies record the visit of a user on our Website, the pages a user has visited and the links a user has followed in order to enable us to make our Website more relevant to the users' interests.</li>
			<li>We do not require that you accept cookies and you may withdraw your consent to our use of cookies at any time by adjusting your browser’s privacy settings. However, if you decline to accept cookies, some functionality on our Website may be disabled and you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires or you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple year</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Flash Cookies</strong>. Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies)&nbsp;to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Website. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. For information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see “<i>Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Personal Information</i>”.</li>
	<li><strong>Web Beacons</strong>. Pages of our Website and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, single-pixel gifs and web bugs)&nbsp;that are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in an email)&nbsp;and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages or opened an e-mail, to understand usage patterns and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.</li>
	<li><strong>Analytics</strong>. We use third party analytics and advertising tools and technologies, in particular Google Analytics and DoubleClick provided by Google, Inc., USA (“Google”). These tools and technologies collect and analyze certain types of information, including IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, media access control address (MAC Address), mobile unique device identifiers, and other similar information via the use of cookies. The information generated by Google Analytics and DoubleClick about your use of the Website (including your IP address)&nbsp;may be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Because we activated IP anonymization for Google Analytics and Double Click, Google will anonymize the last octet of a particular IP address. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity and managing advertising content. To learn how you can opt out from this information collection by Google see “<i>Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Personal Information</i>” below.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>

<p>Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Website. Unless expressly stated otherwise, our website does not provide any Personal Information to these third parties, however the information they collect may be associated with your Personal Information or they may collect information, including Personal Information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content.</p>
<p>We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. For information about how you can opt out of receiving targeted advertising from many providers, see “<i>Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Personal Information</i>”.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Personal Data</h2>

<p>We will only use your personal data when the applicable local law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>

<h2>How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures)&nbsp;to safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access Personal Information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your Personal Information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your Personal Information. Please be advised, however, that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the storage and transmission of Personal Data.</p>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times. We are not responsible for circumventions of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website..</p>

<h2>Choices About How We Collect, Use and Disclose Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Information you provide to us.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our Website.</li>
	<li>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe’s website. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Website may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</li>
	<li>You may opt out of the DoubleClick cookie or of Google Analytics by visiting the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190708090352/https://adssettings.google.com/">Google advertising opt-out page</a> or by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190708090352/https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics opt-out page</a>.</li>
	<li>When you register on our Website, you may be given a choice as to whether you want to receive email messages, newsletters or both about product updates, improvements, special offers, or containing special distributions of content by us. If you no longer want to receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us, you will need to avail yourself of the unsubscribe mechanism set out in the applicable communication. It may take up to seven days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.</li>
	<li>You may opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile devices by activating the “Limit Ad Tracking” or equivalent feature offered by your mobile platform. It will transmit a signal to us and to third-parties that indicates your data should not be used for interest-based advertising.</li>
	<li>If you submit Personal Information, you may delete your account with us at any time. If you delete your account, your Personal Information and any and all other account related information including, but not limited to, user profile data, sharing data and any other data, or content specifically associated with your account will no longer be accessible by you. After deleting your account, if you choose to have an account with us in the future, you will have to sign up for a new account as none of the information you previously provided or saved within your account will have been saved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information</h2>

<p>Subject to local law, you have certain rights regarding the Personal Information we collect, use or disclose and that is related to you, including the right</p>
<ul>
	<li>to receive information on the Personal Information concerning we hold about you and how such Personal Information is used (right to access);</li>
	<li>to rectify inaccurate Personal Information concerning you (right to data rectification);</li>
	<li>to delete/erase your Personal Information (right to erasure/deletion, “right to be forgotten”);</li>
	<li>to receive the Personal Information provided by you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit those Personal Information to another data controller (right to data portability)</li>
	<li>to object to the use of your Personal Information where such use is based on our legitimate interests or on public interests (right to object); and</li>
	<li>in some cases, to restrict our use of your Personal Information (right to restriction of processing).</li>
</ul>
