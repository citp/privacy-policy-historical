# HLNT Networks - Privacy Policy

**We don't rent, loan, swap, share or sell your personal data to anyone.**

_**Our Privacy Policy**_  
HLNT Networks International (HLNT) is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust and accordingly maintains the following privacy policy to protect personal information you provide online.

_**Our Information Policy**_  
At HLNT, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit HLNT on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. Data such as this is collected in a Web form that you fill out - it's your choice.

_**Basic Confidentiality Policy**_  
It is HLNT policy that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number, is private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you provide is accessible only to designated staff, and is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information. If you later tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.

It is your choice whether or not to give us personal information that we or our business partners may need -- to correspond with you, to process an order or to provide you with a subscription, for example. Supplying this information to us via the Internet rather than employing other forms of transmission should result in you obtaining faster, more reliable service from us.

If you also indicate on our site that you would like to receive information about other HLNT programs and services, your personal information will be added to the appropriate HLNT mailing lists.

If at any time you change your mind and would like to add or remove your name from HLNT's mailing list, or correct your personal information, please use our [newsletter subscription form](https://web.archive.org/index.html) or use the other methods of communication (fax, post, etc), the details of which are on our contact page.

_**No Release of Information to Third Parties**_  
Personal information will not be released to third parties except to further the purpose for which you provide the information (see note below) or if release is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.

(Note from above - here are two examples: 1. We may disclose your mailing address to a shipping company for the purposes of sending you a product you have ordered from us. 2. If we process an online order transaction, your details will be passed to our credit card processing company and then on to our bank. Credit card details are processed on a secure server (128 bit SSL encryption technology) which is protected from the Internet by a firewall.

That's what we mean by the phrase above "to further the purpose for which you provide the information".)

There are no other circumstances under which we will provide personal information to third parties.

_**No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information**_  
Other than through the forms that you choose to fill out, our computer is not set up to collect or distribute personal information about its visitors. It does recognise the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the individual visitors to our site. This information is used only for internal (technical) purposes by HLNT technical support staff.

In addition, our web site server compiles information about the visits to our web sites. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from.

These aggregated statistics are used internally to help us to provide better service but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information. We may periodically analyse this data for trends and statistics and then we discard it.

_**The Internet And Cookies**_  
There is an Internet technology called "cookies" that can be used to collect information about visitors to a Web site so that, for example, different Web content can be served up on subsequent visits. Cookies are stored on the user’s (i.e. your) machine, not our server.

You can set your browser to notify you when any Web server offers a cookie, giving you the option of accepting or rejecting it.

At some point we may implement cookie technology if it will allow us to serve you better. Using the browser option described above, you could, in effect disable this technology so that no data is stored. Currently we do not use cookies.

_**Other Sites On The Internet**_  
The HLNT site may contain links to other Web sites. Further, other sites may link to our site. HLNT is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

**** If any of our privacy policy details are altered, the changes will be reflected on these pages.

If you have any questions or comments regarding our information or confidentiality policies please email us at [corporate@HLNT.net](mailto:corporate@HLNT.net) (or use the other methods of communication (fax, post, etc), the details of which are on our contact page.)
