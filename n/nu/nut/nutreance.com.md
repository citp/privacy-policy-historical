## Visiting Our Site

In general, you may visit our Web Site without providing us with any Personal Information. The kinds of information we collect from you will vary, depending on how you use our Web Site.

In addition to the information you choose to submit, our systems are set up to gather certain anonymous data to help us better understand how our Web Site is being used and how we can improve it. We collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our Web Site and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Web Site.

## Cookies

From time to time, Nutreance or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web Site. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of our Web Site you have visited or customized so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you have seen an advertisement. Nutreance and its advertisers may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Web Site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.

## Single-Pixel GIFs

Nutreance and its advertisers may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information. Nutreance does not gather personal information through the use of these images. Our advertisers may use single-pixel gifs that can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user's computer by an advertiser.

## Security of Personal Information

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of your Personal Information in our custody and control. We also are committed to employing reasonable technology in order to protect the security of our Web Site. However, even with the best technology, no Web Site is 100% secure. We will take reasonable measures which we believe are appropriate to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, and where possible, will ask that any third parties to whom we may transfer such information to take comparable steps to protect that security.

## Secure Shopping

When you place orders on our Web Site, all of your order information, including your card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Web Site from capturing and viewing your Personal Information. Since any order information you provide to us on our Web Site will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Web Site. The most recent versions of Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer can support a secure connection and can be downloaded for free from the Mozilla and Microsoft Web Sites respectively.

## Our Privacy Policy and Outside Links

This Privacy Policy only applies to the Web Sites of Nutreance. Our Web Sites may include links to the Web Sites of our business partners, vendors and advertisers. These other sites are outside of our control. Please be aware that these Web Sites may collect information about you, and operate according to their own privacy practices which may differ from those contained in our Privacy Policy. Remember to consult that Web Site's own privacy policy, as once you are outside any of the Web Sites, any information you submit is no longer in our control.

## Privacy Policy Modifications

From time to time we may modify or amend this Privacy Policy in order to comply with new laws or regulations or to reflect future changes in our business practices. Any changes in our policies will be communicated on this page. We also may post a notice on our Web Site or send an email describing the changes.
