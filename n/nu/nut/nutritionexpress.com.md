# Privacy Statement

Privacy Policy

The privacy of online Nutrition Express customers is treated with respect because we know that you care about your personal information. Please take a few minutes and read about our privacy practices.

Nutrition Express (“we”, “us” or “our”) operates [www.nutritionexpress.com](https://www.nutritionexpress.com/) (the “Site”).  This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of the Site. By visiting and using the Site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

This document should answer any questions you may have regarding user privacy and our Site.

The Nutrition Express Privacy Policy was last updated on September 13, 2016.

**Information Collection and Use**

**Personal Information:** Our goal is to provide you with a safe, user-friendly, enjoyable shopping experience. While using our Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact you or identify you. For example, if you post a user review, subscribe to a mailing list, send questions or comments to us via email or social media sites, purchase product or request a catalog through our Site, we will collect personal information which we will use to ship your order, mail a catalog and for other purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. We also may use this personal information to help us research, develop, operate, deliver and improve our products, services, content and customer communications. We may also collect personal information about other individuals, which occurs when you send an order to a friend that requires their name and address. We collect information directly and indirectly from our users at several different points on our Site.

**Ordering:** We request personal information from the user during our order process. Here a user provides contact information (such as name, address, phone number and email address) and may provide payment information (such as a credit card number). This information is used to fulfill your requests, for billing purposes, order fulfillment, anti-fraud purposes or to identify you. For example, if we have trouble processing an order, the contact information is used to get in touch with you.

**Log Files:** Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser version, operating system, referring and exit websites, zip code, date/time stamp, the pages of our Site that you visit, clickstream data, website traffic and related statistics and other data. In addition, we may use third party web analytics services that collect, monitor and analyze this information. We use this information to learn about user behavior on our site, administer the site, improve our Site and gather information about our Site.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technology:** The Site, email messages and Site-related services may use “cookies” and other technologies such as web pixels. They help us better understand user behavior. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive containing information about the user. Among other things, a cookie or other tracking technology is used on our Site in order to help us to keep track of your shopping cart. We may also use them in our emails to help us or our Service Providers determine if you have performed certain actions such as opening an email. These tools help us measure our communications, store items in your shopping cart between visits and to reduce or eliminate messages sent to email subscribers who do not open our emails. You may manage, block or delete some cookies or other tracking technologies by adjusting your browser’s security and/or privacy settings. Acceptance of cookies is not required to browse our site, but our shopping cart does require cookies in order for it to work properly. If you object to or are otherwise unable to use cookies, please call any time to place your order on our toll free number 1-800-338-7979.

**Information Sharing**

**Service Providers:** We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Site services, to provide Site services on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, address verification, credit card payment processors for products ordered, shipment delivery and tracking services to deliver products that were ordered, web analytics, email service providers) or to assist us in how our Site and services are used.

**Others:** We may disclose your personal information if necessary by law, legal process, litigation, requests from public and governmental agencies, or if in good faith believe that such action is necessary or appropriate for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect and defend our rights, property, personnel, suppliers, agents or licensors, and enforce our terms and conditions. We may share information with business partners, or buy or sell businesses or assets. In the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, dissolution or similar event, we may transfer any and all personal information to the relevant third party. We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and/or advertisers.

**Phone/Mail/Fax Orders:** If ordering by phone, mail or fax (not Site orders), we occasionally make portions of our customer data available to companies that offer products or services you may enjoy. To opt-out from the sharing of this information, tell the operator when phoning in your order, or call Customer Care at 800-754-8000. Or, handwrite "Do not share" on your order when mailing or faxing it in. Or, simply order online and we'll automatically set your sharing status to opt-out. Your opt-out sharing status will be permanent until you change it.

We do not rent or sell customer email addresses to any third party.

**Links**

This Site may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the Privacy Policy of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this Site.

**Security**

When our checkout process asks users to enter sensitive information such as a credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. While on a secure page, such as those that encompass our order process, the lock icon on web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are "just surfing."

When creating an account on our Site where you can review past orders, reorder and track shipments, you are required to establish a password. Choose a password with at least six characters and use a combination of letters and numbers to improve security. You should not disclose your password to any other person.

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us and we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.

**Additional Uses & Choice Opt-in/out**

**Telephone Contact:** Users may be contacted by phone if there is a problem or question about an order that they have placed. Also, from time to time, we may phone a small percentage of our customers for input on how to improve our service and product selection.

**Email Contact:** From time to time, we send Nutrition Express newsletter-related emails to our customers, which may include special offers, news, newsletters, promotions, product updates, notice of website updates, etc. Each newsletter-related email message we send provides instructions for unsubscribing from future Nutrition Express mailings. Please allow some time to pass for your preferences to be processed. When you make a purchase, you will automatically be subscribed to our emails unless you opt out during checkout. To opt-out during checkout,  uncheck the “Stay In Touch” box directly under the field where you enter your email address. You may also remove yourself from the email newsletter-related list at any time by logging into your account and editing your Email Preferences, or you may contact Customer Care at 800-754-8000 and tell them you wish to unsubscribe, or you can [contact us](https://www.nutritionexpress.com/policy/contactus) by email to unsubscribe.

If you unsubscribe from the newsletter-related emails, we reserve the right to contact you via email regarding your order or backorder and send order-related emails such as order and ship confirmations.

**Notification of Changes**

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to update or change this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. You should check this Privacy Policy periodically and look for the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy, which indicates the date of a material change. If you visit the site after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy, your continued use of the Site shall constitute your acknowledgement of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If you object to any of the terms in the modified Privacy Policy, you have the right to stop using the Site.
