# Privacy Statement

Privacy Statement

The privacy of Nutrition Express online customers is treated with utmost respect. 

The personally identifiable information on you and your purchases will not be sold, rented or given away to any other company or agency without your explicit permission. When you provide your email address, we will never sell, rent or share it with anyone. If you subscribe to our emails you can unsubscribe at any time. 

This document should answer any questions you may have regarding user privacy and our website.

Information Collection and Use

Nutrition Express is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, rent or give this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Nutrition Express collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

**Ordering:** We request information from the user during our order process. Here a user must provide contact information (such as name, address and phone number) and may provide financial information (such as a credit card number). This information is used for billing purposes and order fulfillment. If we have trouble processing an order, the contact information is used to get in touch with the user. Your phone number is never sold or rented.

**Cookies:** A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. A cookie is used on this site in order to help us to keep track of your shopping cart. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback is that the user will lose their shopping cart if they leave the site for any reason before completing the order process. 

**Log Files:** We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

Information Sharing

We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and/or advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We use a credit card processing company to bill users for purchases. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purpose.

If ordering by phone, mail or fax, we occasionally make portions of our customer data available to carefully screened companies that offer products or services you may enjoy. To opt-out from the sharing of this information, tell the operator when phoning in your order, or call Customer Care at 800-754-8000, or handwrite "Do not share" on your order when mailing or faxing it in. Your opt-out sharing status will be permanent until you change it. Or, simply order online and we'll automatically set your sharing status to opt-out. 

We do not share, rent or sell customer email addresses to any third party. 

Link Issues

This website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Nutrition Express, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as those that encompass our order process, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are "just surfing." 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, customer service representatives and order processing employees) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a securely locked environment. 

If you have any questions about security at our website, you can [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20090622072942id_/http%3A//www.nutritionexpress.com/policies/contactus.aspx) by email.

Additional Uses & Choice Opt-in/out

**Telephone Contact:** Users may be contacted by phone if there is a problem or question about an order that they have placed. Also, from time to time, we may phone a small percentage of our customers for input on how to improve our service and product selection. 

**Email Contact:** We reserve the right to contact you via email regarding your order or backorder including order and ship confirmations. From time to time, we send Nutrition Express emails to our customers which may include special offers, news, newsletters, promotions, product updates, notice of website updates, etc. You will not be included in our Nutrition Express email newsletter/promotions mailing list without your express consent. Further, each email message sent will provide instructions for removing your email address from future Nutrition Express mailings. Emails will be from Nutrition Express only; we do not share, rent or sell our email lists with any third party. 

**Email Choice Opt-in/out:** During the checkout procedure, you will have the ability to opt in or out of our Nutrition Express email newsletter/promotions list by checking or unchecking the Stay In Touch box directly under the field where you enter your email address in the shopping cart. You may also remove your name from the email newsletter/promotions list at any time by contacting Customer Care at 800-754-8000 or by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/web/20090622072942id_/http%3A//www.nutritionexpress.com/policies/contactus.aspx) by email. For information on use and liability, please see our [Terms of Use Agreement](https://web.archive.org/policies/termsofuse.aspx)

Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, notification will be linked from our homepage to the new policy so that our users are always up-to-date on what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances (if any) we disclose it. Users will be notified via email and presented with an opportunity to opt-out should we decide to use information in a manner that is inconsistent with the way in which it was collected.
