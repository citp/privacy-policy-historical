# Privacy Policy • Nxtbook Media

### Information Collected Through the Nxtbook Media Website

Nxtbook Media collects personal information with an individual’s permission through their website for the purposes of:

  * Discussing content solutions with prospects and partners
  * Sending helpful information through blogs and drip email campaigns
  * Getting in touch with readers or partners about technical issues they may be having



With each form that is on the website, the individual filling out the form is required to check an opt-in which clearly lets the individual know what kind of contact they can expect to receive.  The individual is also informed that their contact information will never be shared with a third party. Data collected through our website will be held without time limit, but at the request of the individual their information may be removed from our marketing database.  

### Information Collected Through Client Projects Hosted by Nxtbook Media 

#### Cookies

Nxtbook Media (also referred to as Nxtbook) uses cookies to enhance the end user experience and comply with client requirements for protection and enhancement of their content. Cookies and local storage are required for certain functionality of Nxtbook’s products from a technical perspective, such as:

  * Remembering a user so they aren’t required to authenticate every time they view protected content hosted by Nxtbook Media.
  * Session information used to identify a single anonymized user between server calls within a single session.
  * Remembering and re-applying settings and preferences that an anonymized user has set within our products. This data is stored in the user’s browser local storage and is not sent to Nxtbook or other servers.



#### Digital Rights Management (DRM) / Authentication

Nxtbook Media provides an authentication system (Nxtbook DRM) that some of our clients choose to apply to their content. When DRM is used, Nxtbook stores some information about individual users of the clients’ content using a combination of databases and browser cookies. That information can vary depending on the individual client’s implementation and includes such items as:

  * A list of user accounts consisting of usernames, passwords, and details of what content each user account has access to. This information is typically passed to Nxtbook by the client, but can also come from a Nxtbook hosted custom form, described further in this document, or entered directly by the client using a backend tool Nxtbook provides.
  * Information about how many times a particular user has logged in to access content.
  * Cookies used to track how many pages of content an individual anonymized user has accessed while not logged in and using “Preview mode” in Nxtbook products.
  * Cookies used to Identify when a user has previously authenticated so they can skip the authentication process when returning.



#### Digital Payment System (DPS)

Nxtbook provides a digital payment system (Nxtbook DPS) that is used by some clients to provide paid subscriptions and purchasable content to their users. Financial transactions for this system are processed by Paypal, using the individual client’s account on Paypal’s website. No financial information passes through Nxtbook’s systems or is stored by Nxtbook. Subscription data is stored in Nxtbook’s servers via our DRM system described above, and Nxtbook hosted custom forms, described below. It is not used by Nxtbook for any purposes other than passing the form data to the client, and authenticating users when the client’s Nxtbook hosted content is accessed.

#### Custom DRM

Some clients use a custom authentication system to protect their Nxtbook hosted content. In these cases, the client provides implementation instructions, and Nxtbook implements the authentication logic on our servers. In most cases, this involves collecting the username and password from a user via a form when they attempt to access protected content, and passing that information through to the client’s or a third party API to authenticate against the user’s account in their system. Nxtbook does not store any information in these cases beyond the life of the server call to authenticate.

#### Form Data

Clients of Nxtbook will sometimes use forms within or in conjunction with our products. Some of these forms are maintained and hosted by Nxtbook, while others are hosted and maintained by the client themselves or third parties and embedded within our products.

Nxtbook stores the data input by users into the forms that are hosted by Nxtbook. No data is held by Nxtbook for forms that are hosted by third parties and embedded in Nxtbook products.

The actual data that Nxtbook hosted forms collect varies for each client and is not used by Nxtbook in any way other than to pass to the client upon request, or through automated reports.

#### Analytics and Third Party User Tracking

Nxtbook uses Google Analytics and Adobe Comscore to provide anonymized analytics on the usage of our products. This data is used by Nxtbook internally to understand how our products are used, and provided to clients for as it relates to their content. The data passed to and provided by these services is anonymized and no personal user information is used in the process or passed through to these systems.

Some clients request that Nxtbook add third-party tracking calls to their Nxtbook hosted content. In these cases, the code to implement the additional calls are provided by the client and are integrated as a customization to the client’s content. Nxtbook does not store or have access to any of the data or functionality that these third-party calls provide.

### Your Rights Regarding Your Data
