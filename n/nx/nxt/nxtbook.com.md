## Cookies

What is a cookie?
    A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a Web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. It can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience.
How does Nxtbook use cookies?
    Nxtbook may set and access our own cookies on your computer. Nxtbook uses cookies to facilitate the usage measurement of our Web site and the distributed interactivity and measurement of Nxtbooks. Nxtbook does not maintain any database of personally identifiable information that could be contained in cookies.
What information does Nxtbook put into user cookies?
    When you visit our Web site or open a Nxtbook, we set cookies to identify you as a unique visitor, to maintain your session, and to test your browser and OS settings.
Do we retain the cookies?
    Nxtbook will retain cookies that are set by our Web site or Nxtbooks on your computer and will use them to recognize you when you return to the site or publication.
Third-party cookies?
    Nxtbook may also allow other companies that are providing content, such as Publications, on our Web site or in Nxtbooks to set and access their own cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of cookies is subject to their own respective privacy policies. We do not have access to any information stored in cookies by third parties about you.

## Internet Protocol Addresses

Your computer uses Internet Protocol or "IP" addresses every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Our server automatically collects IP addresses. Nxtbook will not use your IP address to attempt to personally identify you.

## Referrers

A "referrer" is the information passed along by a Web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our Web server. This information is collected and used by Nxtbook to understand the Web sites referring traffic to our Web site and to present appropriate content to our potential customers. Nxtbook tabulates referrer information on an aggregate basis to identify trends and traffic patterns. 

Nxtbook may enter into agreements with content partners that require Nxtbook to count the number of product downloads stemming from a referral from a content partner site. This information is collected, used and aggregated by Nxtbook to fulfill the reporting requirements of those agreements. This information may also be combined with the referrer information described above and tabulated on an aggregate basis to identify general trends and traffic patterns. 

## Other

Nxtbook may automatically receive and record information in our server logs or from our cookie-based tracking service from your browser, including your IP address, your computer's name, the type and version of your Web browser, referrer addresses and other generally accepted tracking information. We may also record Web site page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information that is aggregated with that of other users in order to understand how our Web site and Nxtbooks are being used.
