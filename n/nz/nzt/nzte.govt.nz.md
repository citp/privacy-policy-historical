# Privacy Statement

The following privacy statement applies to the New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) website (the Site) and should be read in conjunction with the general [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/section/11808/5774.aspx) of use and, if applicable, the Registered Users’ Specific Terms and Conditions. By viewing and using this Site you will be deemed to agree to this privacy statement. If you do not agree to this privacy statement you should stop accessing and using the Site.

1\. **Collection:** The NZTE Development Board (NZTE) may gather two types of information about you from the Site: (a) personal information, provided by you at the time of voluntary registration for the services NZTE offers; and (b) aggregate information generated by NZTE’s systems, which track traffic to the Site but do not relate to you personally. Failure to provide necessary personal information when requested may result in certain services not being available to you.

2\. **Disclosure of Information:** NZTE may disclose: (a) any information that NZTE gathers about you to third parties for the purposes of providing you with additional services; (b) aggregate tracking information and other information that does not personally identify you, to third parties; (c) your personal information to third parties, when NZTE believes in good faith that NZTE is required to do so by law; (d) your personal information to third parties, provided NZTE has your prior authorisation, which NZTE will usually obtain at the time of collecting the information from you.

3\. **Use:** NZTE uses the personal information it collects: (a) to verify your identity and assist you if you forget your password or login details for any of NZTE’s registration services; (b) to assist in providing the services requested by you; (c) to provide further information to you about other websites and services or which NZTE considers may be of interest to you; (d) for future marketing, promotional and publicity purposes, including to carry out direct marketing, market research and surveys; (e) for ensuring that you are shown the information that is most relevant to you and your interests; and (f) for any other use that you authorise.

4\. **Cookies and Tracking:** NZTE uses a “cookie” file containing information that can identify details of your IP address, PC platform (e.g. Windows, NT or Mac), Browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Netscape or other, plus the version of Browser), domain (whether you are accessing the Site from NZ or elsewhere) and other user information (e.g. your username). NZTE may use the information generated by cookies to: (a) track traffic patterns to and from the Site; (b) ensure any advertising is being shown to the most appropriate person; and (c) enable you to enter the Site and use certain services and to visit registered user only areas of the Site.

Some pages may not function properly if the cookies are turned off.

5\. **Content Providers, Advertisers and Partners:** NZTE does not control the practices of content providers, partners and advertisers connected with the Site and to whom you provide personal information whilst using one of the Site or services. The Site contains links to other sites, which may not follow the same privacy policies as NZTE. NZTE recommends that you check any relevant privacy policies before providing your personal information to any third party.

6\. **Opting in and Opting Out:** If NZTE’s intended collection, use or disclosure of your personal information is outside the collection, use or disclosure set out in this Privacy Statement NZTE will give you the option to: (a) opt out and not receive certain services or participate in certain interactive areas; or (b) opt in to agree to be contacted by NZTE in relation to certain matters such as notification of new features to the Site, beta testing or promotional activities.

7\. **Holding, Correcting and Updating:** Any personal information that you provide to NZTE will be collected and held by NZTE at its offices at 23 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand. If you are an individual, under the Privacy Act 1993, you have rights of access to and correction of personal information that NZTE holds. NZTE offers the ability to correct or change the information collected at any time and as often as necessary.
