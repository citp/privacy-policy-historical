We use RedSheriff website measurement software and systems to assist in tracking traffic patterns to and from our site, aggregating anonymous information about visits to our site, and randomly and anonymously surveying users of our site. RedSheriff is a leader in the Internet industry in interactive measurement technologies and market research and its system is an accepted standard amongst major New Zealand Internet sites. The system is used to collect information on our network such as the number of page views, the number of unique visitors, how long these visitors spend on the website when they do visit, and common entry and exit points into and from the website. Random anonymous surveys are also used to collect further information about our users. 

This non-personal information is aggregated by RedSheriff and provided to us to assist in our analysis of our websites. The RedSheriff data is also accessible by media organisations and research companies for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other websites. 

All our pages are coded with a small piece of RedSheriff code that is transparent to you when you read that page. The software stores a cookie in your browser (if you have enabled cookies) which contains a unique identifier to allow us to track the number of unique visitors to the website. This information is collected and aggregated by RedSheriff and in no way can you be identified personally and no personal information is stored about you.
