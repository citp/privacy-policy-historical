If you are able to access or use the Sites at a TPS, NZXT may receive or be able to access certain information about you from that TPS. By accessing the Sites through the TPS, you authorize NZXT to access and store such information. You may be able to control and find out more about these settings at the TPS where you access or use our Sites. For example, NZXT may access and store your name, profile picture, location, gender, and other information as allowed by you, the TPS, and your preferences.

Your user profile may include: a profile photo; your name or username; your gender; biographic details that you provide; links to your profiles on various TPS’s; and an NZXT user ID number that is created by NZXT and used to identify your profile.

_Payment Information_   
If payments are possible via the Sites, NZXT may have access to your payment information, including credit card details, in order to process your purchases or other transactions within the Sites.

_Cookies and Automated Information Collection_   
When you access the Sites, we may collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyze the usage of the Sites; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; and (iii) manage advertising.

In some cases, we will associate this information with your user ID number for our internal use.

We may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, and speed up load times.

You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash cookies you can visit adobe.com and make changes at the privacy settings panel. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of the Sites. Please note that companies delivering advertisements through our Sites may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.

  5. ### Sharing of Your Information

We may share your information (in some cases personal information) with parties other than NZXT, in the following circumstances:

_Third Party Service Providers_   
We may provide your information to third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to assist us in our marketing efforts. We direct all such third party service providers not to use your information for any purpose other than to provide Services on NZXT's behalf.

Third party site, platform or service operatorsmay collect, or require that we provide, your information relating to the Sites. Any information made available to such third parties will be used by them in accordance with their own privacy policies. You may be required to consent to, and be fully bound by, those third party privacy policies in order to access, purchase or otherwise use our Sites through those third parties’ sites, platforms or services. We cannot control, and will not be responsible for, the contents of those third party privacy policies. We therefore advise you to carefully review their terms before accepting them.

_Advertising of Third Party Products and Services_   
We may share (i) aggregated information (information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you); (ii) anonymous information; and (iii) certain technical information (including IP Addresses, MAC Addresses for mobile devices and mobile device IDs) to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Sites and on the websites of third parties. We may also allow advertisers to collect these types of information within the Sites and they may share it with us. Advertisers may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and Services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience). To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising for participating ad networks, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance.

Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous or aggregated information are not subject to any of the restrictions in this Privacy Policy.

Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications (including without limitation chat text, voice communications, IP addresses and your personal information) may be accessed and monitored as necessary in NZXT’s discretion and may be disclosed: (i) when we have a good faith belief that we are required to disclose the information in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to satisfy any applicable laws or regulations (iii) where we believe that the Sites are being used in the commission of a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; (iv) when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public generally; and (v) in order to protect the rights or property of NZXT, including to enforce our Terms of Sites.

_Sale or Merger_   
In the event that NZXT undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in such transition. We will seek to notify you and other users through an update to our website or Terms of Sites or this Privacy Policy of an aforementioned business transition involving a transfer of your personal information.

  6. ### How to Access and Update Your Information

_Information We Receive From a TPS_   
To manage the information NZXT may receive about you from a TPS, you will need to follow the instructions at that site for updating your information and changing your privacy settings. You can sometimes manage certain aspects of information collection and use by going to the settings of your (mobile) device and reviewing the permissions of each application.

If you no longer want NZXT to make active use of your information, you may send an e-mail to privacy@nzxt.com. Place "Delete My Account" in the subject line and include your first name, last name, e-mail address and user ID number for the SNS from which you access our Sites (if applicable) in the body of the e-mail. Please note that certain records will be retained for legal and accounting purposes. If you have sent or posted content on the Sites, we may not be able to delete it. Additionally, any information shared with a TPS may be retained by those third parties after we delete it from our records. Please consult the privacy policies of those TPS and SNS to learn about their removal procedures.

We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If your TPS account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorized use of the Sites, so be careful to keep your account information secure.

We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by "opting in" to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you do ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our Sites providers) on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of our sites.
