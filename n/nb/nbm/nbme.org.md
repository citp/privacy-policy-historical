# Privacy Policy | NBME

Date Updated:  October 3, 2016

National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME®) is committed to protecting your privacy and to maintaining the integrity and privacy of personal information that NBME collects through the NBME website (the "Site") located at [www.nbme.org ](http://www.nbme.org/). The following Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains NBME's information collection and dissemination practices in connection with the Site. Please review the Policy and feel free to contact us at [communications@nbme.org ](mailto:%63%6F%6D%6D%75%6E%69%63%61%74%69%6F%6E%73%40%6E%62%6D%65%2E%6F%72%67) if you have any questions. 

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>. 

## 1\. General Users

NBME does not collect any personal information from users browsing its website. Users to the public area of the [www.NBME.org](http://www.nbme.org/) website may browse anonymously. NBME’s web servers may track the Internet protocol (IP) addresses of visitors to the Site to measure number of visits to the website. If you participate in NBME’s examination services (e.g., NBME Licensing Examination Services, NBME Self-Assessment Services), you will be required to provide personal information during the registration process. To access certain portions of the Site, you may have to submit a user ID and password. 

## 2\. Collection of and Consent to Use Personal Information from Site Users

You may provide personal information to us in the process of completing various forms for the United States Medical Licensing Examination® (USMLE®) and/or NBME programs and services for medical schools, students and graduates of medical schools. Personal information may include, but is not limited to: 

  * Name
  * Date of birth
  * Email address
  * Billing and Mailing address
  * Telephone number
  * Credit card and billing information
  * Social security or national identification number
  * Citizenship
  * Gender
  * Medical school history  (including Medical School name, country, professional degree, date degree conferred/expected) 



In general, you are required to respond to most of the questions on the application forms. However, you are not required to provide information regarding your ethnicity or first language. Providing this information is optional and does not affect the outcome of your application. NBME uses information about the ethnicity and first language of its applicants for research purposes, and it is kept confidential.    

By providing your personal information online, you consent to allow NBME to use that information in accordance with this Policy. This information is used for identification purposes and as stated below in Section 6.

In addition to the personally identifiable information described above, we also collect aggregate information from many users about use of the NBME Services Portal (NSP), such as number of visits and pages visited on the NSP, and the overall duration of time spent on the NSP. The information we collect depends in large part upon the needs of your account and what services and features you use on the NSP. We do not disclose this information to third parties.

## 3\. Security

The security of your personal information is of the utmost concern to NBME. We have administrative, technical and physical measures in place to protect the security of your personal information. To protect your privacy, the NBME utilizes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to prevent third parties from seeing your personal and sensitive information (such as credit card number, social security number, or national ID number) during data transmission. 

In order to access some services, you are required to enter a username and password to confirm your identity. For example, to access your personal information for NBME Licensing Examination Services, you must first confirm your identity by entering your USMLE identification number and a password. This authentication page is secured by SSL technology.

When you prepare to pay for services, you will enter our secure payment web page and will have a limited amount of time to enter the required information. NBME uses a third-party vendor to process your online payments. NBME uses digital certificates through VeriSign. As a VeriSign secure site, visitors can verify the site's authenticity and communicate with NBME securely using 128-bit encryption that protects confidential information.

Please note that pages other than the authentication page and payment page may not be secured by SSL or other encryption programs.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In the event there is a breach of the security measures used by NBME, NBME will take reasonable and appropriate actions to minimize the damage resulting from the security breach. However, NBME cannot guarantee that unauthorized individuals will not obtain access to NBME systems through illegal measures, despite our security measures.

If, for any reason, you should choose not to provide your personal information online, you may request a paper version of the application or document request form by calling 215-590-9700 or by email to  [webmail@nbme.org ](mailto:%77%65%62%6D%61%69%6C%40%6E%62%6D%65%2E%6F%72%67). If you have questions about providing your personal information related to the NBME Self-Assessment Services, you may contact [assessmentservices@nbme.org ](mailto:%61%73%73%65%73%73%6D%65%6E%74%73%65%72%76%69%63%65%73%40%6E%62%6D%65%2E%6F%72%67) . 

## 4.  Cookies and Tracking Technologies

NBME and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. 

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in lo g files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. 

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve site functionality. 

## 5.  Credit Card

All credit card transactions are processed through a vendor via SSL. NBME uses a clearinghouse to verify and validate the credit card. NBME does not store or disclose credit card information. 

## 6.  Use of Personal Information Collected

NBME collects and uses the personal information you provide to better serve you. Such information may be used to process your applications and requests for services or materials, to receive support for the services we provide, to verify that you meet the minimum qualifications for our programs and services, to allow us to contact you to provide those services, to complete delivery of services, for billing purposes, and to protect you and NBME from fraudulent transactions. We also use the information we collect to tailor and improve your experience if you use the NSP. Additionally, NBME may use aggregated personal information for research and statistical purposes. NBME does not use your personal information for marketing or promotional purposes.

Your credit card information is used to bill you for services. We will not use your credit card information for any other purpose. 

### User Data Supplementation

We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties, and combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. 

## 7.  Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties

We may distribute the personally identifiable information that you submit to us, both internally within our organization and to our agents and affiliates as necessary for purposes related to our services. While we endeavor to maintain the confidentiality of all material submitted that is identified as confidential by the submitter, we cannot accept, and hereby expressly disclaim, any liability from losses relating to the unauthorized disclosure or interception via the Internet of any information that you submit. 

We disclose your personal information to certain third parties to provide the products and services you have requested online. To support these services, we send a portion of your personal information, such as name and USMLE ID, to them using secured protocols and encryption. They have access to the minimal information needed to perform their functions but otherwise will not use the information for other purposes. For example, when you apply for a USMLE examination, we will provide certain registration information to companies that schedule and administer the test.

NBME uses a third-party vendor to process your online payment transactions. To process these transactions, your payment information must be disclosed to this third party. See Section 3 aboveNBME uses a third-party vendor to process your online payment transactions. To process these transactions, your payment information must be disclosed to this third party. See Section 3 above.

The USMLE is sponsored jointly by the NBME and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB). To ensure an efficient and accurate examination process for applicants, portions of the personal information you provide to us during the registration process are retained in a database shared by the NBME and FSMB for the purposes of exam registration and scheduling. Additionally, this information, as well as performance data from the examination, is used by these organizations for research and statistical purposes, although only in the aggregate.

NBME also shares certain user information, such as USMLE ID, social security number, name, medical school name and graduation date, date of birth, gender and score information with the Association of American Medical Colleges (the "AAMC"). This organization uses the data that we provide for research purposes only. 

NBME also may provide personally identifiable information to certain third parties that have entered into contracts with us to provide certain services. We may also use this information to help us manage programs and services that may be of interest to you.

Please also note that all of your activities on the NBME Services Portal are traceable through your single sign-on (SSO) account. If you use your name as part of your SSO account or User ID, your name may be available to third parties that contract with us to provide certain services after enrollment.

At times we may be required by law, court order or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may disclose information about you, in our sole discretion, if we believe that disclosure is necessary: (a) to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental request or to respond to a subpoena; (b) to operate this website; (c) to protect the safety, rights or property of NBME or users of the NSP or any of NBME's websites; and (d) or as otherwise permitted under this Policy.

In certain situations, NBME may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. 

Other than as noted in this Policy, or as NBME shall notify users in the future, NBME does not sell, rent, share, offer, or otherwise disclose any personal information, such as names, e-mail addresses, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, and other personal information that you voluntarily provide to NBME, to any organization or individual without a legitimate interest (collectively "Third Parties"), except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of NBME.

In the event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business and assets, we reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information in connection with that transaction and you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. In such event, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that your personally identifiable information remains protected.
