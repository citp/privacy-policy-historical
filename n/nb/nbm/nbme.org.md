## 1\. General Users

NBME does not collect any personal information from users browsing its website.  Users to the public area of the [www.NBME.org](http://www.nbme.org/) website may browse anonymously.  NBME’s web servers may track the IP addresses of visitors to the site to measure number of visits to the website.  If you participate in NBME’s examination services (e.g., NBME Licensing Examination Services, NBME Self-Assessment Services), you will be required to provide personal information during the registration process. To access certain portions of the Site, you may have to submit a user ID and password.

## 2\. Collection of and Consent to Use Personal Information from Site Users

You may provide personal information to us in the process of completing various forms for the United States Medical Licensing Examination® (USMLE®) and/or NBME programs and services for students and graduates of medical schools. Personal information may include, but is not limited to:

  * Name 
  * Date of birth
  * Email address
  * Billing and Mailing address
  * Telephone number
  * Credit card and billing information
  * Social security or national identification number
  * Citizenship
  * Gender 
  * Medical school history  (including Medical School name, country, professional degree, date degree conferred/expected) 



In general, you are required to respond to most of the questions on the application forms.  You, however, are not required to provide information regarding your ethnicity or first language.  Providing this information is optional and does not affect the outcome of your application.  NBME uses information about the ethnicity and first language of its applicants for research purposes, and it is kept confidential.   

By providing your personal information online, you consent to allow NBME to use that information in accordance with this Policy.  This information is used for identification purposes and as stated below in Section 6. 

## 3\. Security

The security of your personal information is of the utmost concern to NBME.  We have administrative, technical and physical measures in place to protect the security of your personal information.  To protect your privacy, the NBME utilizes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to prevent third parties from seeing your personal and sensitive information (such as credit card number, social security number, or National ID number) during data transmission. 

In order to access some services, you are required to enter a username and password to confirm your identity. For example, to access your personal information for NBME Licensing Examination Services, you must first confirm your identity by entering your USMLE identification number and a password. This authentication page is secured by SSL technology.

When you prepare to pay for services, you will enter our secure payment web page and will have a limited amount of time to enter the required information. NBME uses a third-party vendor to process your online payments. NBME uses digital certificates through VeriSign. As a VeriSign Secure Site, visitors can verify the site's authenticity and communicate with NBME securely using 128 bit encryption that protects confidential information. 

Please note that pages other than the authentication page and payment page are not secured by SSL or other encryption programs. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.  In the event there is a breach of the security measures used by NBME, NBME will take reasonable and appropriate actions to minimize the damage resulting from the security breach.  However, NBME cannot guarantee that unauthorized individuals will not obtain access to NBME systems through illegal measures, despite our security measures.

If, for any reason, you should choose not to provide your personal information online, you may request a paper version of the application or document request form by calling 215-590-9700 or by email to [webmail@nbme.org](mailto:%77%65%62%6D%61%69%6C%40%6E%62%6D%65%2E%6F%72%67). If you have questions about providing your personal information related to the NBME Self-Assessment Services, you may contact [assessmentservices@nbme.org](mailto:%61%73%73%65%73%73%6D%65%6E%74%73%65%72%76%69%63%65%73%40%6E%62%6D%65%2E%6F%72%67) .

They have access to the minimal information needed to perform their functions, but otherwise will not use the information for other purposes. For example, when you apply for a USMLE examination, we will provide certain registration information to companies that schedule and administer the test. 

NBME uses a third-party vendor to process your online payment transactions. To process these transactions, your payment information must be disclosed to this third party. See Section 3 above. 

The USMLE is sponsored jointly by the NBME and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB). To ensure an efficient and accurate examination process for applicants, portions of the personal information you provide to us during the registration process are retained in a database shared by the NBME and FSMB for the purposes of exam registration and scheduling. Additionally, this information, as well as performance data from the examination, is used by these organizations for research and statistical purposes, although only in the aggregate.  

NBME also shares certain user information, such as USMLE ID, Social Security number, name, Medical School name and graduation date, date of birth, gender and score information with the Association of American Medical Colleges (the "AAMC"). This organization uses the data that we provide for research purposes only. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

Other than as noted in this Policy, or as NBME shall notify user in the future, NBME does not to sell, rent, share, offer, or otherwise disclose any personal information, such as names, e-mail addresses, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, credit card information, and other personal information that you voluntarily provide to NBME, to any organization or individual without a legitimate interest (collectively "Third Parties"), except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of NBME.
