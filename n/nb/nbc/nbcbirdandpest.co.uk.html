<a name="Five"> </a>
<h2>5.	Sharing of personal information</h2>
<p>We may share personal information within the NBC network; by this expression, we mean NBC including together with its/their officers, employees, agents, distributors, consultants contractors (including data processing agencies ("processors")), suppliers and certain selected third party organisations and NBC Bird and Pest Solutions (Franchising) Limited licensees ("<strong>NBC Network</strong>"). The NBC Network will process your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and all privacy and communications legislation.<br>
We will not share with or sell lease or otherwise distribute your personal information to any third party organisations outside of the NBC Network without first obtaining your permission to do so. In particular, we will not release your personal information to our authorised direct marketing agents without first obtaining your prior consent<br>
We currently do not envisage transferring your personal information outside of the EEA. However, providing that we do so lawfully and for the sole purpose of fulfilling our contractual obligations to you you agree to our transferring personal information about you to any member or members of the NBC Network outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). You acknowledge that some countries where other facilities or companies or third party organisations are situated may have no data protection legislation or laws which are less rigorous than the legislation introduced by the member states of the European Union and the EEA. Accordingly, in the event that we need to transfer your personal information to any member or members of the NBC Network outside of the EEA for the sole purpose of fulfilling our contractual obligations with you you acknowledge and agree that we will use reasonable efforts to procure (but cannot guarantee) that such facilities companies or third party organisations give binding contractual undertakings in order to ensure the same level of protection for the processing carried out in these countries as within the European Economic Area.<br>
Of course if we need your further specific and express consent to do this, we will obtain it before transferring any personal information.<br>
In all cases, any use of your personal information by the NBC Network which has been instigated by us will comply with this privacy policy.<br>
You acknowledge that we reserve the right to use or disclose any personal information as needed to satisfy any law regulation or otherwise or legal request to protect and defend the integrity of the Site (including to enforce our <a href="/TermsandConditions.cfm">Website Terms of Use</a> or this privacy policy) and you agree to fulfil our requests and/or to cooperate in any law enforcement or regulatory investigation.<br>
Save for that stated above we do not transfer share or disclose personal information we have collected from you in connection with our on or off-line activities to third parties outside the NBC Network.<br>
If in the future a third party organisation acquires us or substantially all of our assets including without limitation our database(s) (whether by merger, acquisition, reorganisation or otherwise) you acknowledge and agree that your information including personal information may well be one of the transferred assets.</p>

<h2>6.	Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier which asks permission to be placed on your hard drive through your web browser when you visit our Site. Once you agree (or your browser agrees automatically if you have set it up in that way) it enables our own system to recognise you when you visit our Site to track the pages you looked at while visiting our Site and therefore to improve our Site and tailor the service to you. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. For example, when you visit an electronic store such as ours a cookie makes it easier to shop by allowing you to place things into a shopping basket; the basket itself is not a cookie; the cookie is placed on your hard drive and keeps track of your basket versus others in use at the same time. 	
We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system. Denial of a traffic log cookie may prevent you from using the Site. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better Site by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you other than the data you choose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced. We know that people have concerns about cookies but we believe that the benefit that you and we gain from their proper use is worthwhile.</p> 

<p>You may set up your web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely (although you acknowledge that declining them may prevent you from being able to use the Site properly or at all). You can delete the files that contain cookies - those files are stored as part of your Internet browser. To remove cookies from your web browser or to obtain further details on cookies including information on persistent and session cookies please go to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="new">www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.</p>
