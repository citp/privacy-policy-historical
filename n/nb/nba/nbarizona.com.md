  FACTS              DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
  Why?               Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
                     consumers the right to limit some, but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you
                     how we collect, share and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to
                     understand what we do.
  What?              The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have
                     with us. This information can include:
                         Social Security number and assets
                         income and account balances
                         transaction history and credit history
  How?               All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday
                     business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their customers’
                     personal information; the reasons we choose to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.
