As stated above, NBA.com does not solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Please review our Note to Parents, if you have any questions regarding our Policy with respect to children. 

NBA.com does not collect personally identifiable information such as name and e-mail address through the site unless you voluntarily provide that information during registration for various features on the site (e.g., site registration, newsletters, sweepstakes, contests, purchases on the NBA/WNBA Store, etc.). Information required to participate in such features may vary but will typically include your first and last name; address including city, state, zip code and country; complete date of birth; and e-mail address; and, in the case of making purchases, a credit card number and expiration date. You may also be requested to provide a member name and password for certain features. 

**2\. The organization collecting the information**

The NBA.com and NBDL.com web sites are operated by NBA Media Ventures, LLC (“NBAMV”). The WNBA.com web site is operated by WNBA Enterprises, LLC (“WNBAE”). NBAMV and WNBAE are located at 450 Harmon Meadow Boulevard, Secaucus, New Jersey, 07094. Please contact [FanRelations@NBA.com](mailto:fanrelations@nba.com) for more information. You can also learn more about any of the teams of the NBA, WNBA or NBDL by referring to their respective Official Web Sites located within the NBA.com network. The NBA/WNBA Store is operated by Amazon.com. Please refer to the section entitled “special policies applicable to the NBA/WNBA Store” below for more information. 

**3\. How the information is used**

We will use your information to provide you with services you have requested or products you have purchased (e.g., e-mail newsletters, NBA/WNBA Store orders). In addition, NBA.com and its affiliates may use information provided by you or information obtained through third parties to offer better targeted products and services to you. We use targeting to customize and enhance your online experience on the site. An NBA.com user may change or update his or her personal information at any time by visiting the registration area. 

NBA.com uses "cookie" technology. Cookies are pieces of information transferred to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Such technology is an industry standard and is used by most major Web sites. In order to effectively use the site and some of its features (e.g., site registration, NBA/WNBA Store), your browser must accept cookies. 

Users should be aware that NBA.com cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting use of information obtained from cookies) by advertisers or third parties that host or provide data, content and services for NBA.com. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept cookies; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., site registration) available on NBA.com. 

NBA.com tracks certain general usage pattern information, such as what pages people visit within the NBA.com network. NBA.com may log users' IP addresses (the group of four numbers separated by periods, such as 123.45.64.89, that identifies a particular host computer) for the purposes of system administration, site tracking and collecting and reporting aggregate usage information. 

From time to time, NBA.com may solicit your opinion to determine your preferences and dislikes in order to provide you with a better product. These surveys are always optional to the user and your decision not to participate in a survey will not affect your status as an NBA.com user. 

**4\. With whom the information may be shared**

NBA.com will not disclose personally identifiable information about you to others, except in accordance with this Policy or as authorized by you at the time the information is collected.

NBA.com may engage third parties to perform certain services in connection with the operation of aspects of NBA.com. Except as noted in the section entitled “special policies applicable to the NBA/WNBA Store” below, these service providers who have access to your personally identifiable information are authorized to use this information only in a manner consistent with this Policy. 

NBA.com may share your personally identifiable information within the NBA family of businesses – including our retail and mail-order catalog operations – as well as our affiliates, such as the NBA, WNBA and NBDL teams. 

In addition, NBA.com has several partners that can offer valuable products and services to our members. From time to time, NBA.com may share or provide non-identifiable aggregated information to these partners, and, in addition, NBA.com may provide them with mailing address and other information so that they may extend offers to you. NBA.com will not disclose your e-mail address to these partners, unless you have consented to receiving information, special offers or promotions from third parties via e-mail. Your information may also be provided to a company that acquires all or substantially all of NBA.com's assets or in a merger or acquisition, in which case, you will be notified of such transaction and advised of any change in the applicable privacy policy.

While NBA.com is careful in choosing its partners and advertisers, we are only responsible for content on our own sites and for use of your personally identifiable information by us. All third parties associated with NBA.com (including, but not limited to, advertisers, sponsors and other Internet sites) with whom we share information have independent privacy and data collection practices. NBA.com does not control this collection of information and is neither responsible nor liable for their policies or actions. 

NBA.com uses DoubleClick, a reputable third party vendor, to serve the advertisements that you see on the pages of our site.

**5\. Special policies applicable to the NBA/WNBA Store**

The practices described in this section apply only to information gathered through the NBA/WNBA Store, and do not reflect practices with respect to information gathered elsewhere on NBA.com. At the NBA/WNBA Store, if you register or order products, you may provide the following types of personally identifiable information about yourself (or about others, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient): name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and credit card information. 

NBA.com has engaged Amazon.com to perform services in connection with the management and operation of NBA/WNBA Store. As such, in connection with NBA/WNBA Store, Amazon.com will have access to and will use the personally identifiable information you provide in connection with your purchases on the NBA Store, subject to the terms of our agreement with Amazon.com. Examples of how Amazon.com may use your data include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, marketing and promotional material distribution, site evaluation and data analysis. Amazon.com has independent privacy and data collection practices. For more information about those practices, please refer to Amazon.com’s [privacy policy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468496/002-4512949-3691234).

**6\. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information**

You are not required to receive any e-mail communications from NBA.com that you do not wish to receive. During the registration process, you will have the option to sign up to receive newsletters, selected sponsor offers, discounts and other promotions by e-mail. Users will receive such e-mails as a result of their use of NBA.com only with their consent (e.g., through opt-in boxes). If, after you choose to receive such information, you wish to discontinue receiving these e-mails, you may change your preferences by visiting the registration area (NBA.com/FanCenter) or by indicating your preference by following the instructions that may be provided within the e-mails received. If a member name and password are required to access the feature, you will need to provide such information to update your registration preferences. If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it by visiting the registration area and requesting that a hint or a newly assigned password be sent to you. 

You may request to be removed from our catalog and mailing lists by writing to us at 450 Harmon Meadow Boulevard, Secaucus, New Jersey, 07094. Attn: NBA.com Network Fan Relations. To obtain information about having your name and home address removed from marketing mailing lists on a national basis, you may contact the Direct Marketing Association at www.the-dma.org. 

**7\. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control**

NBA.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control. The servers for NBA.com are stored in a physically secure and climate controlled off-site facility. Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we protect against data loss by backing up data, performing consistency checks, and restricting access to information on our servers. When receiving financial information (e.g., credit card number, credit card expiration date) for completing online transactions, our site uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer", an industry standard security protocol. In addition, only those trained employees needed to carry out our business functions will be authorized to have access to information on individual NBA.com customers. 

It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. In addition, we may disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials and if asked to disclose it by subpoena, court order or other legal process. 

Your site membership account is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. At no time will any NBA.com employee ask for your password via e-mail. If you ever receive such an inquiry, please notify NBA.com immediately at [FanRelations@NBA.com](mailto:fanrelations@nba.com). Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your member names, passwords and/or other account information.

Any information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on message boards and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used by others. If users post personal information that is accessible to the public online, the user does so at his or her own risk. Users accept that they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 

**8\. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information**

You will also have the option to correct any inaccuracies in your site membership account or other registration by returning to the registration area and updating your profile and preferences. If a member name and password are required to access the feature, you will need to provide such information to update your registration information. If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it by visiting the registration area and requesting that a hint be sent to you at the e-mail address you originally provided during registration.

 **NBA.COM NOTE TO PARENTS**

It is NBA.com's policy not to solicit any personally identifiable information from children. A number of interactive features on NBA.com require registration to participate (e.g., e-mail newsletters, site registration). All registrants will be required to enter their full name, date of birth, complete address and e-mail address. In some cases, users will be required to select a special member name to be used as an identifier for the feature and must also enter a password and a secret hint that will help us verify their identity if they forget their password. If NBA.com determines that a person is under the age of 13, based on the information provided during the registration process, that person will not be permitted to register for features requiring the submission of personal information, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Instead, when a child under 13 years old tries to register for such features on NBA.com, he or she will be directed to content which does not involve the submission of personal information. Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on NBA.com that involve the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes) and they will not be contacted about special offers or promotions. 

NBA.com works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features described on NBA.com. Such third parties may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in accordance with their respective privacy policies and are themselves responsible for ensuring that their sites comply with applicable laws. Features that permit registration by children under 13 years old include fantasy games (e.g., Virtual GM) hosted by ESPN.com and team screensavers hosted by NewTier.com and Websaverlive.com. Registration for these features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third parties operating the web sites on which registration occurs. For more information, please review the privacy policies of each respective third party site. However, NBA.com does not knowingly obtain, retain or use information from anyone who indicates that they are under 13 years old.

If you have any questions or comments, you can contact us at [FanRelations@NBA.com](mailto:fanrelations@nba.com).
