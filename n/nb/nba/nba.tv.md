# NBA.com NBA.com Network Privacy Policy

Please be advised that the NBA.com Privacy Policy has been updated.

The new Privacy Policy, like the old one, outlines how we collect and use information from you based on your activities on the NBA.com Network and from other data sources. We have revised our Privacy Policy to better clarify some of our existing practices, including how we use “cookie” technology, such as combining aggregated and anonymous data with cookies; share personally identifiable information with third parties to perform services on our behalf; use data collected on the site; and collect user preferences and send emails based on those preferences. To update your user preferences at any time, you may visit the registration area at [www.nba.com/fancenter](http://www.nba.com/fancenter). 

If you accept the new Privacy Policy, you don't need to take any action. If you do not wish to accept the new Privacy Policy, you may cancel your NBA.com registration by sending us an e-mail from the account you registered with to FanRelations@NBA.com and include the word 'Cancel' in the subject line or writing to us at 450 Harmon Meadow Boulevard, Secaucus, New Jersey, 07094, Attn: NBA.com Network Fan Relations.

Your use of any part of the NBA.com Network indicates your acceptance of this Policy and of the collection and use of your personal information in accordance with this Policy.

With respect to persons age 13 or older, the NBA.com Network collects personally identifiable information required to participate in certain NBA.com Network features and transactions (e.g., in connection with site registration, newsletters, games, sweepstakes, promotions, purchases on the NBA/WNBA Store, etc.). This information may vary but will typically include your first and last name; address including city, state, zip code and country; complete date of birth; and e-mail address. In case you are making purchases online, a credit card number (including CID number) and expiration date may be required as well as shipping, billing and other information you provide to purchase or ship an item and other transactional information based on your purchase activities on the NBA.com Network. You may also be requested to provide a unique member name and password to access and use certain features of the site.

In addition, the NBA.com Network may solicit from time to time your opinion to determine your preferences and dislikes in order to provide you with a better product or offering. These surveys are always optional, and your decision not to participate in a survey will not affect your status as an NBA.com Network user.

The NBA.com Network also may collect non-personally identifiable information, including traffic statistics regarding page views; other technical information, including IP address and standard web log information; and supplemental information from third parties. The NBA.com Network also uses web beacons and other similar technology to track certain general usage pattern information, such as the web pages people visit within the NBA.com Network. The NBA.com Network also may log users' Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (the group of four numbers separated by periods, such as 123.45.67.89, that identifies a particular host computer) for the purposes of system administration, providing certain site functionality and content, site tracking and collecting and reporting aggregate usage information. We may combine this and other non-personally identifiable information with the personally identifiable information that we have collected.

You may customize the browser settings of your computer to notify you when a browser cookie is sent or to refuse browser cookies altogether. Please check your browser for instructions on how to make these adjustments. 

You also should be aware that the NBA.com Network cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting use of information obtained from cookies) by third parties that host or provide data, content and services for, or advertise on, the NBA.com Network.

**7. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control**  
The NBA.com Network has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control. The servers for the NBA.com Network that contain personally identifiable information are stored in a physically secure and climate controlled off-site facility. Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we protect against data loss by backing up data, performing consistency checks, and restricting access to information on our servers. When receiving financial information (e.g., credit card number, credit card expiration date) for completing certain online transactions, including those in connection with the NBA.com/WNBA Store, the NBA Photo Store, and Audio League Pass, our site uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer," an industry standard security protocol. Other features, like email and contact us are not encrypted. When providing sensitive information on the Internet, you should also look at your browser to determine whether SSL technology is being employed (usually indicated by a image of a lock in the browser frame). In addition, only those trained employees needed to carry out our business functions will be authorized to have access to information on individual NBA.com Network customers. 

It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. 

Your site membership account is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. At no time will any NBA.com Network employee ask for your password via e-mail. If you ever receive such an inquiry, please notify the NBA.com Network immediately at [FanRelations@NBA.com](mailto:FanRelations@NBA.com). Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your member names, passwords and/or other account information. 

Any information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on message boards, web logs, and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used by others. If users post personal information that is accessible to the public online, the user does so at his or her own risk. Users accept that they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

 **NBA.COM NETWORK NOTE TO PARENTS**

It is the NBA.com Network's policy not to knowingly solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. A number of interactive features on the NBA.com Network require registration to participate (e.g., e-mail newsletters, site registration). All registrants will be required to enter their full name, date of birth, complete address and e-mail address. In some cases, users will be required to select a special member name to be used as an identifier for the feature and must also enter a password and a secret hint that will help us verify their identity if they forget their password. If the NBA.com Network determines that a person is under the age of 13, based on the information provided during the registration process, that person will not be permitted to register for features requiring the submission of personal information. Instead, when a child under 13 years old tries to register for such features on the NBA.com Network, he or she will be directed to content which does not involve the submission of personal information. Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on the NBA.com Network that involve the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes) and they will not be contacted about special offers or promotions. 

The NBA.com Network works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features described on the NBA.com Network. Registration for these features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third parties operating the web sites on which registration occurs. Such third party sites may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in accordance with the privacy policies posted on those sites. The operators of those third party sites are responsible for ensuring that their sites comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules. For more information, please review the privacy policies of each respective third party site.
