    <h1>NBA Hoop Troop Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>NBAHoopTroop.com is a web site operated by Turner Digital Basket Services, Inc., a division of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. and its affiliates (“Turner”) pursuant to an agreement with NBA Media Ventures, LLC ("NBAMV"), NBA TV, LLC ("NBATV") and NBA Properties, Inc. ("NBAP") (NBAMV, NBATV and NBAP collectively referred to as the "NBA Entities").  The NBA Entities and Turner collectively are referred to herein as "we", "our" or "us".</p>
<p>The privacy of our visitors at NBA Hoop Troop is important to us. We are providing this summary of our information practices (“Privacy Policy”) because we are committed to helping our visitors understand what information is collected on our websites and online services (“Site” or “Sites”) and how they may control this information while exploring our Sites. This Privacy Policy governs our information practices on NBAHoopTroop.com and any Sites that we operate and link to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be subject to separate or additional privacy notices presented at the point of data collection.</p>
<h2>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p><strong>Personal Information and Account Registration.</strong> Some of our online activities, such as online polls or surveys, ask for a screen name, city or state of residence, age, gender or a favorite basketball team or player.  For sweepstakes and promotions, we may request and use an email address and possibly a first name so that we may respond to visitors’ requests on a one-time basis and then promptly delete the requested information.  Participation in other activities like membership in the Amazing Arena may require account registration, which may request a parent’s email address, password, password hint (a secret question that is a reminder for a forgotten password) and screen name or “troop name”.   The parental email address collected for Amazing Arena Membership is used for the limited purposes of providing parents with notice of the registration, password reminders, and updates regarding their child’s activity on the Amazing Arena account.  A parent can request not to receive this news and these updates regarding their child’s membership on the Amazing Arena account by following the opt-out instructions in the initial parental notice email or by visiting the Parents’ section in the Amazing Arena and clicking the “email removal” link.</p>
<p><strong>Visitor Communications.</strong> Some areas of our Sites allow visitors to contact us or tell a friend about our Sites. These areas may request personal information about the visitor or other people, such as the email address of the recipient. Email addresses provided to us for this purpose are used solely to respond to the child’s request and are deleted from our system once the message is sent.</p>
<p><strong>Device and Usage Information Collected Through Cookies and Similar Online Technologies.</strong>We, our service providers, and third parties collect certain information automatically when visitors use our Sites, such as the type of computer or mobile operating system (e.g., Windows or Mac) and browser (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, mobile Internet browser) used to access our Sites, mobile carrier, domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., AT&amp;T, Earthlink), certain identifiers such as unique device identifier, IP address, and mobile device IP address, and usage information (such as page requests, email open rates, average time spent, video or game player settings, achievements, activities and content viewed on our Sites). We, our service providers, or third parties may use cookies or similar online technologies to collect this information and enhance our visitors’ online experience at our Sites and across the Internet. For example, we place cookies on a visitor’s computer browser or device when they visit our Site so we can store their preferences and analyze their use of the Site, such as how many times someone visits our Sites and various sections of those Sites. For more information about cookies and how browser settings can be changed to reject them, visitors should check their browser’s Help menu or settings. Some of our Sites may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash cookies”) for Adobe’s Flash player and similar applications in order to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. This technology may also remember settings, such as screen size or font selection. Flash cookies are not managed through a visitor’s web browser, but Flash management tools can be accessed from  <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">Adobe's website</a>. We, our service providers, and third parties also may use clear gifs (or “web beacons”), images, or scripts to collect data, such as the number of visitors to a web page or app, or to deliver a cookie or other content to a visitor’s browser or device. If a visitor decides not to accept cookies and similar online technologies from our Sites, that visitor may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of our Site. By using the Sites without rejecting cookies and similar online technologies, visitors consent to our use of such technologies to collect and process information.  At this time, this Site does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include “do not track” instructions.</p>
<h2>HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SITE</h2>
<p>In addition to providing our products, programs, and services, we use visitors’ information to fulfill their transactions and respond to their requests for content and information, such as enabling them to enter our sweepstakes or contests, or play games on our Sites. We also use the information we collect to support our internal operations, including personalizing content and experiences for visitors, authenticating visitors, improving and personalizing the design and content of our Sites, analyzing Site usage, and serving contextual advertising. We may use the information we collect to prevent potentially illegal or offensive activities or to enforce our rights or the rights of other visitors or third parties. We also may use the information for any other purposes disclosed to visitors at the time we collect their information or with appropriate consent.</p>
<h2>HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SITES</h2>
<p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We sometimes use agents, contractors, or other service providers to provide services on our behalf to our visitors, such as helping us administer and fulfill prizes for a promotion, contest or sweepstakes. In these cases, we require service providers to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information. We may also use reputable third parties and service providers for activities in support of internal operations, such as to perform analytics or to serve contextual advertisements.</p>
<p><strong>Co-Branded Sites and Promotions.</strong> Some of our Sites, or portions of our Sites, may be provided with a sponsor or by one or more of our business partners who may also collect or have access to visitors’ personal information. If this is the case, we will provide a notice at a point where the personal information is collected on the Site.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Affiliates.</strong> We may share visitors’ information with our parent company and our affiliated companies.</p>
<p><strong>External Links.</strong>Our Sites may contain links to other websites, services, content, and applications whose information practices may be different from ours. Following these links may interact with or take the user to other party websites, services, content, and applications that may offer content or games, or conduct contests or sweepstakes that are separate from our Sites. We are not responsible for the practices of these third parties, and we recommend that visitors review their privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Process, Law Enforcement, and Corporate Transactions.</strong> We and our agents, contractors, and service providers may disclose information we maintain when required to do so by applicable US or other law, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, legal process, or other claim or inquiry. We also may disclose such information in response to a US or other law enforcement agency’s request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, and to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Sites and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by US or other law or legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer visitors’ information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as the sale of a Site, a merger or acquisition, consolidation, asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
<p><strong>With Consent.</strong> We may disclose visitors’ information for any other purposes with appropriate consent or at their direction. We never sell, rent, or otherwise share our visitors' personal information with third parties without appropriate consent.</p>
<h2>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h2>
<p>We operate globally, so it may be necessary to transfer information we collect internationally. In particular, the information provided likely will be transferred to and processed in the United States by us, our agents or contractors. Our privacy practices are guided by data privacy laws in the United States. The data protection laws of the United States or other countries may not be as comprehensive or equivalent to those in the visitor’s country of residence. By using the Sites, visitors consent to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of their information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and any other privacy notice provided at the time the information is collected.</p>
<h2>OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY</h2>
<p>We maintain procedures intended to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the personal information we collect. Personal information collected at the Sites will not be stored for longer than is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or identified at the time the information is collected or for the purposes of complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, enforcing our agreements, and responding to visitor requests.</p>
<h2>CHOICES; QUESTIONS; CONTACT US</h2>
<p>Visitors, parents or guardians with questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy or who would like to review or update personal information collected on the Sites, have this personal information deleted, or request that there be no further collection, use, or disclosure of this personal information can contact us using the information below.</p>
