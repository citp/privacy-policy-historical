# Privacy Policy

Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:

#### Information Collected and Stored Automatically

This site collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. In addition, we may place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information, although it will enable us to relate a user's use of our site to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided to us.

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does _not_ identify you personally. We automatically collect and store _only_ the following information about your visit: 

  * The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site; 
  * The date and time you access our site
  * The pages you visit
  * If you linked to the NBR website from another website, the address of that website.



We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do _not_ track or record information about individuals and their visits.

#### If You Send Us Personal Information

If you choose to provide us with personal information -- as in an e-mail or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it to us through our website -- we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested.

Please contact [tech@nbr.org](mailto:tech@nbr.org) if you have any questions regarding our Privacy Policy.
