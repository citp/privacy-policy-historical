Privacy Notice
         Norfolk State University provides this Internet site as a public service. We do not obtain
personally identifying information about you when you visit this site unless you choose to
provide such information to us.
         Any information collected within the context of your email inquiry or comment is used
only for the expressed purpose of responding to your inquiry or comment. We collect personally
identifiable information only if specifically and knowingly provided by you.
         For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes. NSU’s computer
system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as
assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design
specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. This information is not
expressed in any form that would reveal personally identifiable information.
         NSU provides numerous online applications, forms and queries. When a user visits the
NSU website to perform a transaction (sending an application, initiating a query, receiving a
query response, etc), the web server receives data or sends a response and then may send a
cookie prior to breaking the connection with the user.
    A cookie is a small piece of software that is placed by a web server on users’ personal
computers and is then used to personalize the site when a visitor returns. A transaction or
session, may involve a number of such information exchanges, each followed by a break in the
connection. In order to maintain the state (where one is in the process) of a transaction, the NSU
websites may place session cookies in memory allocated to users’ browsers. Session cookies
permit the users to perform transactions as if they were connected to the NSU website
throughout the course of the transactions or sessions. Session cookies are erased from the users’
61.001: Internet Website Acceptable Use and Privacy Policy                                         1


systems when they close their browsers; other cookies have an expiration date, or can be cleared
from the users’ cache. We will not use cookies to: acquire information about you, relay your
name to third-party mailing lists, scrutinize your web usage for marketing purposes by third
parties, or penetrate your hard drive.
      I.     Choice to provide information
             There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information at our website.
             However, some services of the website may not be fully functional without providing
             requested information. Failure of your browser to accept cookies will not prevent
             your use of our website, but may prevent certain features from working. If you wish
             to not provide this optional information, a particular feature or service associated with
             that part of the web page will not be available to you.
      II.    Information we collect
             When you access our website the routing or client information and the technical
             information listed below, is automatically collected. No other information is
             collected through our website except when you deliberately decide to send it to us
             (for example, by clicking on a link to send us an email). All information collected by
             the website consists of the following:
             1. Routing or client information: the Internet domain and Internet address of the
                  computer you are using.
             2. Essential technical information: identification of the page or service you are
                  requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using, and the date and
                  time of access.
             3. Nonessential technical information: the Internet address of the website from
                  which you linked directly to our website, and the "cookie information" described
                  below in number 5.
             4. Optional information: when you send us an e-mail- your name, e-mail address,
                  and the content of your e-mail; when you fill out online forms- all the data you
                  choose to fill in or confirm.
             5. Cookies: Our website places a “cookie" on your computer, unless your browser is
                  set to reject cookies. The cookie enables our website to recognize that you have
                  visited our website before and does not contain any personal information.
      III. How the collected information is used
             Routing information is used to route the requested web page to your computer for
             viewing. We send the requested web page and the routing information to our Internet
             service provider or other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you.
61.001: Internet Website Acceptable Use and Privacy Policy                                           2


             We do not control the privacy practices of those entities. Essential and nonessential
             technical information helps us respond to your request in an appropriate format and
             helps us plan website improvements.
             Optional information enables us to provide services or information tailored more
             specifically to your needs or to forward your message or inquiry to another entity that
             is better able to do so, and also it allows us to plan website improvements.
             We may keep your information indefinitely, but we ordinarily delete the transaction
             routing information from our computer within 30 days after the web page is
             transmitted and do not try to obtain any information to link it to the individuals who
             browse our website. However, on rare occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach
             computer security, logs of routing information are retained to permit a security
             investigation and in such cases may be forwarded together with any other relevant
             information in our possession to law enforcement agencies. We use this transaction
             routing information primarily in a statistical summary type format to assess site
             content and server performance. We may share this summary information with our
             business partners when needed.
             Optional information is retained in accordance with the records retention schedules at
             the Library of Virginia.
             Under the “Virginia Freedom of Information Act”, any records in our possession at
             the time of a “Freedom of Information Request” might be subject to being inspected
             by, or disclosed to, members of the public.                   However, all identifiable
             confidential/personal information will be removed prior to releasing the routing
             information.

    IV.      Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
             Web publishers must be aware of the needs of those getting information about NSU
             from our websites—for example, people with color blindness or other visual
             disabilities. Reasonable accommodations for them include good color contrast with
             text, labels for graphics, text descriptions for videos, and support for screen reader
             compatibility.
             Web accessibility improvements have carry-over benefits for all users. Users may
             have different browsers and different monitor resolutions. Accessibility encompasses
             the use of simple orientation tools for all users including site maps, links back to main
             pages, and large file download warnings. Everyone benefits from a well-designed,
             highly accessible web page. When developing pages, web publishers should refer to
             the http://www.section508.gov/ for guidance in creating content that is accessible to
             the widest possible audience.
61.001: Internet Website Acceptable Use and Privacy Policy                                           5


             The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that institutions provide
             "reasonable accommodations" to clients and users with disabilities. It goes beyond
             prohibiting discrimination; it ensures inclusion for everyone in education, work-life,
             and services in their communities. NSU is committed to making all our campus
             activities accessible to users, including those who may be disabled, or differently
             abled.
