  * the previous site visited; and 
  * the type of browser and operating system you have used.



## How do we use the information collected?

The information collected during each visit is aggregated with similar logged information and published in reports in order for GCIO to identify patterns of usage of the site. This will assist us in improving the NSW Government site and the services offered on it. 

GCIO will not disclose or publish information that identifies individual machines, or potentially identifies sub-groupings of addresses, without consent or otherwise in accordance with the New South Wales Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1988.

  * unauthorised attempts to index the contents of the NSW Government site by other sites;
  * attempts to intercept messages of other users of the NSW Government site;
  * communications which are defamatory, abusive, vilify individuals or groups or which give rise to a suspicion that an offence is being committed; and
  * attempts to otherwise compromise the security of the web server, breach the laws of the State of New South Wales or Commonwealth of Australia, or interfere with the enjoyment of the NSW Government site by other users.



GCIO reserves the right to make disclosures to relevant authorities where the use of the NSW Government site raises a suspicion that an offence is being, or has been, committed.

In the event of an investigation, GCIO will provide access to data to any law enforcement agency that may exercise a warrant to inspect our logs.

The provision of personal details on feedback is optional.

Users may provide personal details for the purpose of receiving a reply to their feedback. This information will only be used for the purpose for which it was provided. We will not add your email address or name to any mailing list.

GCIO may publish aggregated information about feedback on the site, to the extent that it does not identify or cannot be used to identify individual users.
