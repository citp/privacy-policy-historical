**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**  
  
NS provides links to external sites as a convenience to the Visitor. The inclusion of any link does not imply NS endorsement of the external site company, its web site, or the products andservices it promotes and sells. When you leave the NS site to visit one of these linked sites, the only information transferred to the third party is the fact that you came from nscorp.com(the refer address). This practice allows the third party to monitor its own Web site traffic, but does not provide them with any information about you. Norfolk Southern is not responsible or liable for the independentprivacy policies of our third party sites. You should consult the privacy policies at those sites to determine how your information may be used.

**WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE WILL USE IT**  
  
Our web servers collect the IP addresses, not the e-mail addresses, of Visitors. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. NS uses this information to measure the use of our site, to improve the content of our site, and to monitor access for security purposes.

Visitors can visit most areas of the NS Web site without revealing who they are or providing any information about themselves or their company. However, some services accessible through the NS Web site require that Visitors identify themselves in order to enable the function. We may ask Visitors to provide some personal and business information in these situations.

Visitors to the NS site can, if they choose, participate in additional secured interactive functions. For access to these functions, Visitors first are required to complete a registration form. This form includes information such as name, address, phone number and e-mail address as well as company related information. We use the information from the registration form to enhance our services, to better meet the needs and preferences of our customers, and to enhance the security of the NS site.  We may also from time to time send information to registered Visitors about NS products, services and system changes that we think may be of interest.

All activities at the NS Web site may be monitored and recorded.  For registered Visitors, we may make this information available to your company.
