# NSF - Information - About NSF's Privacy Policy and Web Site

Thank you for visiting the National Science Foundation web site. Please note that we collect no personal information about you when you visit our web site unless you choose to provide that information to us. 

If you are simply visiting the NSF home page to browse through our site, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store **only** the following information about your visit:

  1. The **Internet domain** (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our web site; 
  2. The type of **browser** and **operating system** used to access our site; 
  3. The **date and time** you access our site; 
  4. The **pages** you visit; and 
  5. If you linked to the National Science Foundation site from another web site, the **address of that web site**. 



We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors -- to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do **not** track or record information about individuals and their visits. 

If you request information or services from NSF and submit personal information to facilitate response to your request, we use the information provided to respond to your message. We will not share the information you give us with another government agency unless your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise provided by law. We do not create individual profiles with the information you provide or collect information for commercial marketing. 

Users of NSF's [Custom News Service](https://web.archive.org/home/cns/) fill out a simple form when setting up their Custom News Service profile. A Custom News Service profile cannot be created without a valid e-mail address. However, NSF makes no attempt to identify individual users or their selections. 

If you conduct business with NSF electronically, such as through FastLane, any information voluntarily submitted as part of that process will be used and protected as explained for the specific function involved.
