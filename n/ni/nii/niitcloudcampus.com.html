                information what you share with NIIT, to any third party for any purposes like marketing
                etc. without your explicit consent. This statement of privacy is applicable to our

                names and applies generally to subsidiaries of NIIT Limited. Your use of NIIT website
                signifies your acceptance of the NIIT Privacy Statement.<br>
                <br>
                NIIT strives to comply with applicable laws that are designed to protect your privacy.<br>
                <br>
                Any interpretation of the terms of this Privacy Policy shall be in consonance with
                the “terms of use”.

                <h4>
                    2. NIIT’s Principles to protect Privacy</h4>
                In order to protect your privacy, NIIT has adopted the following principles:<br>
                <strong>a)Security</strong> <strong>
                    <br>
                    b)Choice</strong>
                <br>
                <strong>c)Notice</strong>
                <br>
                <strong>d)Access/Accuracy</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                (a)Security<br>
                &nbsp;Wherever your Personal Information may be held within NIIT, the company intends
                to take reasonable steps to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. NIIT
                is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety
                of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information
                from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal
                information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located
                in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such
                as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the
                use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
                <br>
                <br>
                (b)Choice
                <br>
                You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to NIIT. The notice
                NIIT intends to provide at the point where it collects Personal Information on the
                Site, should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal
                Information we request, you can still visit most of NIIT's Web sites, but you may
                be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction
                with you. If you chose to have a relationship with NIIT, such as a contractual or
                other business relationship, NIIT will naturally continue to contact you in connection
                with that business relationship.
                <br>
                <br>
                (c)Notice
                <br>
                Where NIIT collects Personal Information on the Site, NIIT intends to post a purpose
                statement that explains why Personal Information will be collected and whether NIIT
                plans to share such Personal Information outside of NIIT or with those working on
                NIIT's behalf. Unless the transfer of Personal Information is legally required,
                NIIT does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your permission to
                third parties who are not bound to act on NIIT's behalf.
                <br>
                <br>
                (d)Access/Accuracy
                <br>
                To the extent that you do provide NIIT with Personal Information, NIIT wishes to
                maintain accurate Personal Information. Where NIIT collects Personal Information
                from you on the Site, its aim is to provide a means of contacting NIIT should you
                need to update or correct that Information. If for any reason those means are unavailable
                or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your Personal Information
                to privacy@NIIT.com and NIIT will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes.

                at the time of collection, how it will use the personal information. Usually, the

                process an order or allow you to access specific account information. Occasionally,

                interesting. In these cases, you will be offered an opportunity to limit access
                to your information. In case NIIT does not receive any response from you to limit
                the access of your information, it shall be deemed that you consent to such distribution
                of your Personal Information as mentioned above.
