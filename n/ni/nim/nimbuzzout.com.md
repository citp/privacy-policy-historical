### 2\. HOW AND WHY DOES NIMBUZZ USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Our reasons for collecting information relating to you or your Device are to enable Nimbuzz (or sometimes other data processors selected by Nimbuzz) to provide the Nimbuzz Services through the Nimbuzz application or other applications provided by Nimbuzz to you in an effective and satisfactory way, as follows:

  * processing your log-ins, messages and calls and enabling the other features of the Nimbuzz Services;

  * resolving disputes;
  * verifying your identity;
  * for legal reasons, e.g., checking that you comply with the Terms of Use and Nimbuzz policies, and preventing crime and fraud;
  * customizing, understanding users’ use of, and improving the Nimbuzz Services and Nimbuzz Website (this includes customization of advertising based on your location, or features such as indicating when you were last online, notifying your contacts when you are playing a Nimbuzz game or permitting you to invite them to participate in Nimbuzz games); and
  * informing you of additional products, services and offers provided by Nimbuzz.



Nimbuzz stores the personal information in different data files kept on servers based in the Netherlands. Nimbuzz will take all reasonable measures to ensure security of the data, including where such servers may be operated by third party data processors under Nimbuzz’s responsibility.

If we provide a method for you to invite friends to join Nimbuzz, then their contact information will only be used for the purposes of automatically generating a message to these potential Nimbuzz users. Nimbuzz Services also have a function that can check the names and phone numbers in your address book against the list of Nimbuzz users and informs you of existing contacts that are already registered for Nimbuzz Services and with whom you may want to connect. If you are already in the address book of other Nimbuzz Services users they be informed that you are a Nimbuzz user you so that they can decide whether to connect with you.

If we process data regarding the location of your Device then (i) in case of services such as allowing location requests from your Nimbuzz contacts, you will be able to switch this functionality on or off at any time within the Nimbuzz Services, and (ii) where this is used in order to provide advertising appropriate to your locality then we may provide this to our third party advertising partners but never in a form that you will be able to be identified from this data; and your acceptance of this privacy statement constitutes consent for this processing.

  


### 3\. DOES NIMBUZZ TRANSFER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANYONE ELSE?

Nimbuzz does not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer any personal information, log-in information, communications data or communications content to any third party without your express permission (unless it is obliged to do so under applicable laws or by order of the competent authorities) except as set out in this Statement.

Nimbuzz needs to provide certain information to third parties who assist Nimbuzz in providing elements of the Nimbuzz Services.

Under their contracts with Nimbuzz they are required to store and process your information in accordance with similar standards of protection of your data as applied by Nimbuzz.

### 4\. WHAT ITEMS ARE PLACED ON YOUR DEVICE WHEN USING THE NIMBUZZ SERVICES OR WEBSITE?

In order to use most of the Nimbuzz Services, you will need to install the relevant software on your Device. This software enables you to make and receive communications using your mobile network or the internet and sends the necessary communications data, and other data that you define (e.g., profile or status updates, community log-in data) between your Device and the network.

In addition, for web-based Nimbuzz Services, “cookies” may be used. Cookies are pieces of information stored on your Device in order to enable web-based applications to recognize who you are or your preferences (e.g., what language version of the Website you usually use) and provide Nimbuzz with information about the use of its Websites).

Most internet browsers allow you to prevent your Device from accepting or using cookies or require your permission each time a cookie is received. Please note that some personalized Nimbuzz Services may not be available if you choose to disable cookies.

Advertisements appearing on Nimbuzz Services or Websites may be provided by Nimbuzz’s advertising partners who may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics. The information obtained in this way (e.g., how many times the Website is visited, how many times you see a particular advert) is used to deliver adverts to you. In addition, we may use profile information about you (e.g., your gender, age or pastimes) to provide advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you, including by combining with other available information about you. We may share your information with advertisers or other third parties that assist us with these types of services, when we have either removed from it anything that personally identifies you, or encoded or combined it with other information so that it no longer personally identifies you.

You can view, manage and block the third party services that use your Nimbuzz ID by logging into your Nimbuzz profile at any time. If your Nimbuzz friends sign up for third party services using Nimbuzz Connect, then the information they share may include your Nimbuzz ID so that they can also connect with you on the third party service.
