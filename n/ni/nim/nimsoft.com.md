# Nimsoft Privacy & Security Policy

**Your Privacy**

Nimsoft is committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers and visitors to our web site. In particular, we want you to know that Nimsoft is not in the business of selling, renting or trading individuals' personal data to other companies for marketing purposes. In this Privacy Policy we provide detailed information on when and why we collect personal information, how we use it, the limited conditions under which we may disclose it to others, and how we keep it secure.

**Collection and Use of Personal Information**

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify you, such as, your name, title, phone number, email address or mailing address.

In general, you can browse our web site without giving us any personal information. Additional activities on our site require you to be registered - for example, to receive white papers, to request a trial version of our software or to register for an event. As part of the registration process, we ask you to fill in a simple html form where we collect additional personal/contact information. We use that information for several general purposes: to tell you about products, seminars and services if you so request; to fulfill your request; to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to verify the accuracy of our records; or to contact you regarding customer satisfaction surveys.

**Use of Cookies**

Part of our data collection process may involve the use of "cookies", which are small pieces of identifying information placed and stored on your computer by our server which enable our system to more readily "recognize" you when you visit. Cookies are frequently used to enable sites to more efficiently provide service, such as to customize the display to suit your interests, note your interests while visiting our site, and store information. It is our policy that any information obtained through the use of cookies will only be used internally by Nimsoft to better provide service to you and to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the Site. Cookies will not be used to track your activities outside of the site or for any purpose not disclosed herein. 

You may elect not to accept "cookies" by setting your Internet options on your computer; however, please be advised that in that case, you may not be able to access part or all of this site, or parts of this site may not operate effectively. 

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

In rare instances we rely on our channel partners to fulfill product trials and information requests, and provide customers and prospective customers with information about Nimsoft and its solutions. To do this, we may pass your information to them for that purpose only, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Nimsoft sometimes hires vendor companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering items, sending postal mail, providing technical support and processing event registrations. In addition, we may use third party information or technology in our products and disclose customer information to such third parties solely for the purposes of fulfillment, support, or audit by such third parties. Because Nimsoft is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other Nimsoft offices or subsidiaries in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere, but will never be sold or traded. The data protection laws in these countries may be more or less extensive than laws in the country in which you are located. However, Nimsoft and its offices and subsidiaries are governed by this Privacy Policy and will use your personal information only as set forth in this policy. At your request, we can provide you with data protection details of the countries relevant to you.

**Children and Privacy**

Our web site does not offer information intended to attract children. Nimsoft does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13.

**Links to Other Web Sites**

Our web site contains links to information on other web sites. We do not have any control over these other web sites, and therefore we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting those sites. Those sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy, and if you have questions about how a site uses your information, consult the linked site's privacy statement.

**Unsubscribing**

Unsubscribing From General Marketing Communications:

Your privacy is important to us. You may “opt out” at any time via the opt-out weblink that appears at the bottom of any marketing emails you receive from us.

**Your Consent**

By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of the information you provide to us as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and without notice. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will publish those changes on this page.

If you have any questions or concerns about our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information, please email [privacy@nimsoft.com](mailto:privacy@nimsoft.com). For more information about this site or your visit, please email us at [webmaster@nimsoft.com](mailto:webmaster@nimsoft.com).
