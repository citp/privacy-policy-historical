Personal information means information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable from the information, whether the information or opinion is true or not and whether it is recorded in a material form or not.

Sensitive information is a subset of personal information which is generally afforded a higher level of protection. It includes your health information, genetic information, biometric information, as well as information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of political, professional or trade associations, or trade unions, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or practices, and criminal record.

For the purposes of this privacy policy, any references to personal information include sensitive information.

We collect personal information primarily to enable us to provide health benefits and related services. nib may also use this information for marketing to you or for any other purpose permitted under the Privacy Act (Cth). You do not have to identify yourself when you deal with us (e.g. to obtain a quote). However, we will in certain situations need to only deal with individuals who have identified themselves to us. Also, if the information provided to us is not accurate or complete, we may not be able to provide an accurate quote, or provide benefits for the requested health or related services.

The personal information nib collects and holds will depend on whether you are a customer or policy holder or a provider or shareholder or job applicant and which services you have used. Information that we collect about customers may include:

### Will my personal information be given to anyone else?

In providing you with nib's health and related services and using personal information in accordance with this Policy, nib may disclose your personal information to other parts of our wider company, or other people and organisations assisting us with our services, located both in and outside Australia (including the Philippines, the USA and Sweden). Those entities include:

When we pass on personal information to others or outside Australia, we take steps to ensure that it is treated in the same way that we would treat it.

nib may also be required to disclose your personal information to other individuals on your nib policy, or to individuals to whom you have granted authority to act on your behalf. For example, at the time of joining nib, the person applying for the nib policy authorises nib, on your behalf, to share information with the policyholder.

Otherwise nib may disclose your personal information if:

  * you authorise nib to do so
  * your health and safety or that of others in the community is at risk
