This page explains our privacy policy and how we will use and protect any information about you that you give us when you visit this website.

## The Data Protection Act

Under the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.

## What information do we collect?

We collect three kinds of information from visitors to nidirect: 

  * feedback (through visitors emailing us)
  * customer satisfaction surveys (via online surveys)
  * site usage information, using cookies and page tagging techniques including JavaScript



## Feedback

We welcome your feedback.

Should you send an email to us seeking advice or information that we are not in a position to give, we may pass your email to the appropriate government department, executive agency or Non Departmental Public Body who may be able to assist you further. An example of an external body that provides services on nidirect is the Driver & Vehicle Agency (DVA). 

Once we have replied to you, we keep a record of your message for a maximum of three months for reference and audit purposes, after which we will delete.
