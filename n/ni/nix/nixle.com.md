****_U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor_**  
Everbridge complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Everbridge has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Everbridge’s certification, please visit <http://www/export.gov/safeharbor>.  

  _Note About Safe Harbor Invalidation:_ In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued a ruling which invalidated the EU-US Safe Harbor Framework as the basis for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States. We know that our customers trust and rely on us for the delivery of critical information to individuals globally, and therefore we have taken action to address the changes that have arisen around the transfer of personal data following the CJEU decision. Everbridge has implemented the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses (also referred to as the Model Clauses) as part of a Data Processing Addendum which is pre-signed by Everbridge and provided through the “Everbridge Data Processing Addendum And Standard Contractual Clauses” link on the bottom of the homepage of [www.everbridge.com](http://www.everbridge.com/). We further note that on February 2, 2016, the US and the European Union announced their agreement to a new framework referred to as the EU-US Privacy Shield. There is more to be done before the Privacy Shield framework can be implemented and therefore we will continue to monitor these developments and will provide updates on [www.everbridge.com](http://www.everbridge.com/) as they become available.

  * Information that you provide by filling in forms on our Website when registering for white papers or webinars, Everbridge University, posting material, or requesting further services and information about our solutions or when you report a problem with our Website. This includes information such as name, email address and phone number.
  * Records and copies of your correspondence (including e-mail addresses), if you contact us.
  * Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research purposes.
  * Your search queries on the Website.

  * Demographic information, such as country and state.



 **  
_Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies._**

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.  We do this to improve our offered services, marketing, analytics, and site functionality.  Please note that Everbridge does not attempt to collect any sensitive information such as personal financial information, social security or driver’s license numbers, or personal health information on our Websites.

Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to and from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our Websites. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to [www.everbridge.com](http://www.everbridge.com/).

 ** _How Do We Collect Information on our Mobile Application?_**  
When you download access and use a Mobile App, it may use technology to automatically collect:

  *  **Usage Details.**  When you access and use the Mobile App, we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the Mobile App, including traffic data, logs and other communication data, and the resources that you access and use on or through the Mobile App.
  *  **Device Information.**  We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the device’s unique device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information and the device’s telephone number.

  *  **Location Information.**  We may ask you for your location when using our Mobile App or text opt-in services in connection with sending or receiving messages from one of our Customers. You will have the option to include your location which will only be used to assist our Customers, with whom you are affiliated generally, either as an employee or citizen, to provide better communication in the event of an incident or emergency. You may opt-out of location based services at any time by editing the setting at the device level **.**
  *  **Mobile Analytics.**  We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile App on your phone. This software may record information such as: how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the Mobile App.



 **  
_How Do We Use Information We Collect?_**

  *  **Customer Data.**  We use Customer Data only for purposes pursuant to the provision of the Everbridge Services and in accordance with the Customer Services Agreement. These uses include, but are not limited to, the provision of our notification services, customer support, notification of new features and services, and changes to the Customer Portal. We may also use Customer Data to contact you regarding administrative notices, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Customer Services Agreement.
  *  **User Data.**  We use User data as described throughout this Privacy Policy.
  *  _ **Nixle® Anonymous Tipping**_ ** _._** The Anonymous Tipping service will allow you to anonymously report information about a crime or highly suspicious activity. No identifying information will be collected or recorded by Everbridge through the online submission unless you specifically provide such information. In connection with an SMS tip submission, Everbridge will store your number to allow for two-way communication and if you are affiliated with a Customer of Nixle Services, a name will be associated with that number, but your name and phone number will not be displayed to enforcement agencies or other third parties. In addition, Everbridge uses industry standard encryption and other safeguards to provide security and anonymity of the information being submitted. Although such encryption and safeguards are utilized, due to the nature of internet and mobile SMS delivery networks, we cannot and do not guarantee 100% security or timely delivery or receipt of the information you submit. Neither Everbridge nor any third party makes any representation as to if, how or when any information you submit may be acted upon by law enforcement agencies or public safety officials. In addition, Everbridge cannot guarantee how often any such agency or official will review and monitor submitted tips. **_Under no circumstances should you rely on the anonymous tip service to report issues of an emergency nature or for conditions requiring an immediate response. If your issue is an emergency, please use a telephone to dial 911._**



 **  
_With Whom Do We Share Your Information?_**  
We may disclose aggregated information about our Users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy:

  * To our subsidiaries and affiliates to provide support to you in connection with our Websites or Everbridge Services. To contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them. Our service providers are authorized to use Customer Data we share with them only as necessary to provide services to us.
  * To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you give us an e-mail address to use the “e-mail a friend” feature of our Website, we will transmit the contents of that e-mail and your e-mail address to the recipients, or if you opt-in to text based notifications we will use your mobile number to send those notifications to you.

We do not sell, trade, or rent Customer or User data to others.
