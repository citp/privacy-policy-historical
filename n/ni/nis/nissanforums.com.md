# GFoS Inc. User Agreement

**Privacy Policy**

Welcome to GFoS Inc. Because we care about your personal privacy, we describe here our information gathering and dissemination practices. Remember, this policy applies only to our site. When you leave our site through linking to one of our advertisers or vendors, you should always check their privacy policies as they may differ from our own 

**What Information Do We Collect?**

**IP addresses and cookies**  
We use your IP address to be sure that we know when a unique visitor is on our site, to diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. We may track the URL of the last website you visited before you came to GFoS Inc., and the URL you went to after leaving our site. We also use cookies to customize your experience on our site so it is compatible with your operating system and to deliver information to you customized to your specific interests. For example, if you visit featured stories about cars and equipment used for camping, we might advise you of products, services or new information geared to camping or other outdoor experiences. Your cookie is stored only on your own machine. It does not contain any credit card, address or other personal information, and is shared only with those vendors with whom you place an order. Some features are available on our site only through use of a cookie. You may usually disable our cookies on your browser, but if you do so, you may not be able to use certain features of our site, and we will be unable to optimally customize your visits to our site. 

Aggregate information on the number of visitors to the site, demographic information (like make and model of car owned, age, gender, and the like), and anonymous user profiles developed using these techniques, may be shared with our advertisers, affiliates and vendors. 

**Personal Information**  
You can visit our site, read articles and other materials, and check on offerings without giving us any personally identifiable information. If you wish to purchase any parts or accessories online, however, you must establish a credit card account with us or our vendors. That necessitates collection of additional personal information, such as your full name, billing address, credit card number and credit card expiration date. 

We may offer you the opportunity to complete surveys online, to enter contests or sweepstakes or participate in polls. While most polls are anonymous, most surveys are not. You must provide personal information, however, to enter contests or sweepstakes in order for us to contact you if you win. Any personal information you provide, such as e-mail address, full name, street address, telephone number, hobbies or interests, type of car you drive, or any other information will be available to GFoS Inc., and may be available to our advertisers, vendors and promotional partners. We may use your personal information to notify you of other publications, products or services from us, our affiliates, vendors or promotional partners which might be of interest to you. If at any time you do not wish to receive such communications from GFoS Inc., you may opt out by e-mailing customerservice@GFoS.com.

  
If you purchase anything from our participating vendors, we and the vendor involved will maintain information about your transactions. We will also provide to all of advertisers, vendors and affiliates anonymous aggregate information about online transactions at this site. 

**How Do We Use Your Information?**  
Personally identifiable information will be used to fill your orders, to contact you in response to your questions; to provide you with notices about new products or services available from GFoS Inc., our vendors, advertisers and affiliates; and to advise you of administrative or other issues related to the site (such as any significant down time associated with scheduled or unscheduled maintenance).
