**Privacy and Cookies**

This page explains our privacy policy and how we will use and protect any information about you that you give us when you visit this website.

This privacy statement only covers the NIHR website. It does not cover all sites that can be linked to from this site, so you should always be aware when you are moving to another site and read the privacy statement on that site.

**The Data Protection Act  
**  
Under the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.

We do not pass on your details to any third party or other government department.

**Changes to our policy**

If our privacy policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on this page. Regularly reviewing the page ensures you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.

The NIHR website contains links to and from websites of other organisations. This privacy policy applies only to the NIHR site.

**Following a link to another website**

When you go to another website, read the privacy policy on that website if you want to know what it does with your information. NIHR does not pass on any of your personal information to other websites.

When you come to the NIHR website from another website, NIHR may get personal information about you from the other website. You should read the privacy policy of websites you visit that link you to NIHR if you want to know about this.

These policies will explain how they collect and use your personal information, and whether they pass this on to websites they link you to.

**Social networking websites**

The NIHR website has a button on the homepage so you can use Twitter with the NIHR website. This website is not controlled by NIHR. By using this button you accept the privacy policies of that website.

Twitter is a social networking service. Users send short updates, or mini-blogs (known as tweets), that are no more than 140 characters long. You can collect followers and follow other users. You can also tag words, and search tags to find out what other people are talking about.

**Use of cookies**

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task 
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested 
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast 
  * analysing anonymised data to help us understand how people interact with govt services so we can make them better 



You can manage these small files and learn more about them from the article, [Internet Browser cookies](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/SiteInformation/Cookies/DG_WP201851?CID=Central&PLA=url_mon&CRE=managing_cookies) – what they are and how to manage them.
