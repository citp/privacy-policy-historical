# Nitro-Pak: Privacy Policy - Customer Service

## What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?

When you place an order, we ask you to provide information to complete your order by filling out and submitting an online form. This information includes your name, telephone numbers, mailing address, e-mail address and credit card information. All information regarding our online customers is stored on a highly secured server that is not accessible through the Internet.

To continuously assess the value of our online shopping experience, we may track the way customers use our site; however, this information is analyzed only in the aggregate and not at the individual level. Nitro-Pak has a strong history of providing excellent customer service and our goal is to continue this tradition online. To this end, the information you provide us will help us tailor our communications and product offerings so that you receive more of what you want and less of what you do not want when shopping with us through nitro-pak.com.

With your permission, from time to time, we may notify you of special offers and/or send you online information that may be of interest to you based on information you have given us and on your buying history at Nitro-Pak.
