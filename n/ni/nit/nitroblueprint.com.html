    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">It 
    is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California Act.&nbsp; 
    Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of 
    the act.&nbsp; In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic 
    information from all visitors.&nbsp; This is not usually personally 
    identifiable.&nbsp; If you purchase a product or service via this website (and 
    thereby become covered by the Act), the purchase agreement you 
    electronically sign prior to purchase allows the website to collect and 
    archive all the personal information you provide and to transmit and/or 
    transfer that personal information to third parties.&nbsp; There is no way you 
    can modify this information and you have no right to do so.&nbsp; Under the terms 
    of the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or receive any 
    information about our database.&nbsp; In the event that the website, under advice 
    of counsel agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must submit 
    whatever information is demanded by the website in insure that the website 
    is releasing information to the correct party.&nbsp; Other provisions of the OPPA 
    may exempt this website from complying.&nbsp; While we take measures to ensure 
    that outside parties do not have access to any information we have about 
    you, we do not warranty that outside parties will not breach our system and 
    thus have access to your information.&nbsp; (You should know that merchant 
    service providers do not allow us access to your credit card information.)&nbsp; 
    This Privacy Policy also is subject to change without notice.&nbsp; You are 
    required to read it prior to using the website.&nbsp; By interacting with the 
    website you agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By 
    using the website or purchasing a product through this website, you waive 
    the right to use state or federal court systems to address complaints and, 
    instead, agree to use the American Arbitration Association located in a city 
    and county specified herein.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">This 
    website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, 
    members, and customers.&nbsp; This information is obtained in various ways, such 
    as:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>
    <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">VISITOR,

    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
    Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes 
    active, positive steps to communicate information to this website.&nbsp; This can 
    include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or subscribe 
    to a mailing list; it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it 
    can include requesting information from the website via email, mail, or 
    courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other membership 
    organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
    Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the website 
    via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service 
    processing.&nbsp; This information is kept at the highest level of security and 
    is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the 
    purpose of communication with the customer.</span></p>

    Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart 
    services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card 
    provides information to the website but does not provide complete credit 
    card numbers.&nbsp; In the process of online ordering, the customer provides, 
    name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, CVV2 (back of card) 
    number, and, occasionally a member password.&nbsp; You should consider all this 
    information available to the website.&nbsp; This information is used to deliver 
    the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for 
    general solicitation purposes.</span></p>

    two, they are subject to any ‘submission’ provisions of the Terms of Use, 
    Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; While your email address may or
