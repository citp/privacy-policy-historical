# NITRC: Privacy

### Privacy Notice

Of the information we learn about you from your visit to "nitrc.org," we store only the following: the domain name from which you access the Internet, the type of browser you are using, the date and time you access our site, and the Internet address of the Web site from which you direct-linked to our site. This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. Unless it is specifically stated otherwise, no additional information will be collected about you. 

When inquiries are emailed to us, we store the question and the email address information so that we can respond electronically. Unless otherwise required by statute, we do not identify publicly who sends questions or comments to our Web site. We will not obtain information that will allow us to personally identify you when you visit our site, unless you chose to provide such information to us. 

#### About "Cookies"

While visiting www.nitrc.org, you may occasionally encounter a Web page that employs "cookies." A cookie is a small file that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk allowing our server to "remember" specific information about your session while you are connected. 

Requests to send cookies from NITRC Web pages are not designed to collect information about you, but only about your browser "session." The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of these Web pages. The cookie and the information about your session will be destroyed automatically shortly after you close your browser—it is not permanently stored on your computer. Unless a NITRC Web page specifically notifies you otherwise, we will not collect and maintain personal information about you. 

Our tool/resource surveys employ persistent cookies. Participation in this data collection effort is completely voluntary, and failure to respond will in no way affect the visitor's ability to access information. This information will be used by the tool/resource administrators solely for the purpose of improving their information. 

To protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after you have finished conducting business with a Web site that uses cookies. If you are concerned about the potential use of information gathered from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you before it accepts a cookie. Most Internet browsers have settings that let you identify and/or reject cookies. 

Questions about NITRC privacy policies should be sent to [nitrcinfo@nitrc.org](mailto:nitrcinfo@nitrc.org).
