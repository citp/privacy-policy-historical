<p><strong>Effective Date: August 7, 2012</strong></p>

<p>This privacy notice covers the collection and use of information for this website, <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/">http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/</a> (“this website” or “we”). This website is owned by The Nielsen Company.</p>

<h2>What information we collect and how we use it</h2>
<p>We ask those interested in obtaining more information about Nielsen's products and services to provide their names, email addresses, name of their company or website, telephone number and industry. Clients may gain access to their information through this site and may use a password or other means of authentication to do so.

We use your contact information to fulfill your request or respond to your inquiry, and may alert you to Nielsen reports, studies, Webinars or publications on related topics in which we think you may be interested. The emails that we send contain links that enable you to “unsubscribe” from future such mailings.</p>

<p>We ask those that seek a career at Nielsen to complete an application and provide related information.

<h2>Cookies and Web beacons</h2>
<p>To keep track of your choice of language and home page preference, we place a cookie on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Our “preference” cookie expires after thirty (30) days. We also use a small piece of code (sometimes referred to as “1x1 clear pixel,” “Web beacon” or “clear GIF”) placed in the pages of our website to help us gather additional information about which parts of the site receive the most visitors and other user traffic patterns, and enable us to administer the site. We also use cookies to understand your Internet usage, including other websites that you visit and, occasionally, your exposure to certain Internet advertisements as you surf the Web. To opt out of this explicitly, please <a href="http://server-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/o?oo=total&amp;tu=http://www.nielsen.com/content/corporate/policy/en/cookie-policy.html" target="_blank">click here</a>. </p>

<p>No personally-identifiable information is contained in our cookies or transmitted through our Web beacons.</p>

<h2>When we may disclose your information to others</h2>
<p>From time to time, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Notice, we may partner with unaffiliated companies or individuals for market research product development or similar purposes. These companies or individuals may be provided with access to personally identifiable information, but we will require by contract that they agree to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of such information. We also may subcontract with other companies and individuals to do work on our behalf; they may be provided with access to personally identifiable information, but only as needed to perform their functions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Notice, we may disclose personally identifiable information to any third party when disclosure is required by law, or desirable to permit us to exercise or preserve our legal rights or take action regarding potentially illegal activities or to protect the safety of any person. In the event that The Nielsen Company is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or in the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</p>

If a parent or guardian believes that this site has collected the personally-identifiable information of a child under the age of 13, please <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/campaigns/privacy-policy-opt-out.html">contact us</a> and we will use our best efforts to remove the information from our records.</p>

<h2>Access to your information</h2>
<p>You may contact us if at any time you would like to see the personally identifiable information we hold about you, or to ask us to correct or update this information, or to ask us to delete it.</p>

<h2>Data storage, transfers and security</h2>
<p>We may store the personal details we hold about you for as long as needed, for the purposes described in this policy, and in accordance with law. Your information may be stored in the United States or elsewhere but in any event will be stored using administrative, managerial and technical measures to protect its confidentiality.

<h2>We may change this Notice and our data collection and management practices.</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to update and make material and non-material changes to this Notice and to our practices in collecting and handling personally identifiable information. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email prior to their implementation and let you decide if you want the material changes to apply to your personally-identifiable information.
