 **Why you can trust Nielsen with your privacy?**

For over 50 years, the Nielsen name has been synonymous with high-quality, comprehensive television audience viewing information.

Through Nielsen Digital Voice panel, Nielsen provides a similar market research service for the Internet industry.

 **What information do we collect?**

During Nielsen Digital Voice initial panel registration processor as part of a Nielsen research survey , we request certain information, such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, date of birth, sex, occupation, level of education, and annual income, about you and other members of your household.

Once you have completed your Nielsen Digital Voice registration and our software has been installed on your computer, we will automatically collect a broad range of other information, including personally identifiable information, from you and all others in your household because our software allows us to comprehensively track members' computers and members' activity on their computers, online and on the Internet. 

For example, we collect information on:

  * The type, name and use of some of the applications, files and hardware on your computer (such as Microsoft Word, Gmail, music and video files, and printers and routers)

  * The date and duration of the web sites you visit
  * Details of certain online transactions, such as retail purchases and banking activity, you enter into on the Internet.
