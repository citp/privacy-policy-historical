Once you register with NigerianNation and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. If you are browsing the Website without registering with NigerianNation, you are anonymous to us, but we will collect the information listed below under Personal Information Collected Via Technology. 

**Use of information**  
Any visitor of the NigerianNation website can view your profile information and photos that you have uploaded to the NigerianNation community. You can control what part of your profile information and photos is visible to visitors of the NigerianNation website and which network of NigerianNation members can see what information. 

To provide you with some of the features that the NigerianNation community offers to its members, we may use Personal Information that is stored in your profile after you have requested such features, for example to send invitation e-mails to people that you specified as being interested in joining the NigerianNation community. In order to provide useful information about social networks to people who might be interested in joining the NigerianNation community, we may use your profile information and photos on the NigerianNation website and when we send emails, for example when we send birthday reminders to NigerianNation members or when we send general newsletters to members of the NigerianNation community. When you decide to view a member's profile, we may show that NigerianNation member that you chose to view their profile. If you don't want us to show to other NigerianNation members that you viewed their profile, you can change this in your privacy settings.

If you decide to use certain features of the NigerianNation network (like journals, testimonials, groups, message boards and the like), some of the Personal Information you entered into your NigerianNation profile and any information, including Personal Information, that you enter using one of these features, might be used and displayed.  
NigerianNation members can use the search feature to search for other members by different criteria, like location or gender. The Personal Information that NigerianNation members enter into the NigerianNation profile will be used for these searches.  
Please be aware that any information that is publicly posted throughout the NigerianNation network can be accessed by every visitor of the Website.

NigerianNation may analyze any collected information for its own internal purposes. In addition, NigerianNation may remove personally identifying information from collected information to render it anonymous. NigerianNation may use Anonymous Information for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Information in its discretion.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
NigerianNation does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or as otherwise described in this privacy policy. 

We provide your Personal Information to third party service providers who work on behalf of or with NigerianNation under confidentiality agreements to provide some of the services and features of the NigerianNation community and to help us communicate with NigerianNation members. These service providers may use your personal information to help NigerianNation communicate with you about offers from NigerianNation and our marketing partners. However, these service providers do not have any independent right to share this information.

If you decide to use one of the additional services that are offered by our partners, such as the e-mail finder service or the electronic fax, we may forward Personal Information to these partners to enable them to provide the services that you requested.  
We also provide information to third-party advertising companies, as described in the next section.  
Please be aware that the handling of your Personal Information by our partners or the third-party advertising companies is governed by their privacy policy, not ours.

We will disclose information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may disclose information, if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities or fraud, situations involving the physical safety of any person, violations of NigerianNation's terms of use, or as otherwise required by applicable law. 

If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you search the NigerianNation community by using a toolbar that NigerianNation, or a third party provides, we may collect Anonymous Information about you automatically, but we will not collect Personal Information.

An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track your IP Address when you login to the Website.

NigerianNation may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website.

Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on webpages within the NigerianNation network. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.

**Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences**

If you would like to opt out of these messages, you may delete your account by sending an e-mail message to support@NigerianNation, subject: account deletion. Please include your full name, e-mail address in the body of the message.

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you and your NigerianNation account information is protected by a password that you select. NigerianNation uses industry-standard SSL encryption in certain areas of the Website to protect data transmissions.  
However, no company, including NigerianNation, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.
