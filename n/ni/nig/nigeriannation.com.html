  and disclose Anonymous Information in its discretion.<br>
  <br>

  We also provide information to third-party advertising companies, as described

  your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, 
  or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Website you clicked. This 
  type of information is collected to make our services and solutions more useful

  or a third party provides, we may collect Anonymous Information about you automatically, 
  but we will not collect Personal Information.<br>
  <br>
  An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically 
  assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address 
  stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer 
  internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. 
  We track your IP Address when you login to the Website.<br>
  <br>
  "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computerýs 
  hard drive while you are viewing a web site. NigerianNation.Com may use both session

  (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more 
  personal and interactive experience on the Website. Persistent Cookies can be 
  removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose 
  to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly.<br>
  Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on webpages within 
  the NigerianNation.Com network. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to 
  their own privacy policies, not this one.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences 
  </b><br>
  We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the NigerianNation.Com 
  service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the NigerianNation.Com 
  Newsletter, that are considered part of your NigerianNation.Com account. If you would 
  like to opt out of these messages, you may delete your account by sending an 
  e-mail message to support@nigeriannation.com, subject: account deletion. Please include 
  your full name, e-mail address in the body of the message.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Confidentiality and Security </b><br>
  We limit access to personal information about you to employees and third parties 
  who we reasonably believe need access to that information to provide products 
  or services to you or in order to do their jobs. <br>
  <br>
  We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal 
  information about you and your NigerianNation.Com account information is protected 
  by a password that you select. NigerianNation.Com uses industry-standard SSL encryption 
  in certain areas of the Website to protect data transmissions.<br>
  However, no company, including NigerianNation.Com, can fully eliminate security risks 
  associated with Personal Information.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Other Sites</b><br>
  Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience 
  and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its 
  contents. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible
