    <h1>Niantic, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: October 6, 2015</strong>  </p>
<p>Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re
providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection,
use, and disclosure of information that we receive through our Services. This
Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party websites, services, or
applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please
note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms
used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of
Service. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of
Service.</p>
<p><strong>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy
Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this
Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this
Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the
Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the
“Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.</p>
<p><strong>Collection and Use of Information</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Information Collected or Received from You</strong><br>
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our
Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you
are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our
Services.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Account Information</span>. If you create an Account with Google,
we’ll be able to access and collect your email address and other PII that your
privacy settings with Google permit us to access. During game play, we will
collect certain information, such as your Agent Name, messages sent to other
users in public COMMS, and Portals that you interact with, that will not allow
others to identify you unless you choose to use your real name and other
identifying information.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies</span>. Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection
tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</p>
<p>“<strong>Cookies</strong>” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web
server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and
persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell
us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to
monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize
and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted
when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most
browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to
stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting
Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be
able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third party
services providers that we engage (including third party advertisers) may also
place their own Cookies on your hard drive.</p>
<p>“<strong>Web Beacons</strong>” (also known as web bugs, pixel tags, or clear GIFs) are tiny
graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for
several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and
measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our
Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies,
which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded
invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</p>
<p><span class="underline">Information Related to Use of the Services</span>. Our servers
automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services
(we refer to this information as “<strong>Log Data</strong>”), including both Account holders and
non-Account holders (either, a “<strong>User</strong>”). Log Data may include information such as
a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web
page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or
features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those
pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked
on, and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we
analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve,
customize, and enhance our Services by expanding their features and
functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use
a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about
how our Services are used.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Information Sent by Your Mobile Device</span>. We collect certain
information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a
device identifier, user settings, and the operating system of your device, as
well as information about your use of our Services.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Location Information</span>. We collect and store information about
your location when you use our App and take game actions that use the location
services made available through your device’s mobile operating system, which
makes use of cell tower triangulation, wifi triangulation, and/or GPS. You
understand and agree that by using our App you will be transmitting your device
location to us, and that location, along with your Agent Name, will be shared
publicly with other Users through the App when you take an in-game action. We
may also use location information to improve and personalize our Services for
you.</p>
<p><strong>Information that We Share with Third Parties</strong><br>
We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as
described below:</p>
<p><span class="underline">Information Shared with Our Services Providers</span>. We may
engage third party services providers to work with us to administer and provide
the Services. These third party services providers have access to your PII only
for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated
not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Information Shared with Third Parties</span>. We may share
aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for
industry research and analysis, demographic profiling, and other similar
purposes.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</span>. Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to
be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a
transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale or if our assets are
acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter
bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or
transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</span>. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or
private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any
information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private
parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (a) to
respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (b) to protect our
property, rights, and safety and the property, rights, and safety of a third
party or the public in general; and (c) to stop any activity that we consider
illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices</strong><br>
We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of
your PII and we’ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide
not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to access
all of the features of the Services.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Opt-Out</span>. We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly
promote our Services. When you receive such promotional communications from us,
you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” (either through your Account or by
following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive). We
do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services and you will
not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding
updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy or information about
billing.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Modifying Your Information</span>. If you want us to delete your
PII and your Account, please contact us at
<a href="https://support.ingress.com/hc/articles/206618198"> https://support.ingress.com/hc/articles/206618198 </a>
with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can,
but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as
otherwise required by law.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to Do Not Track Signals</strong><br>
Our Site does not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals
received from various web browsers.</p>
<p><strong>The Security of Your Information</strong><br>
We take reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to
protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII)
from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no
method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is
completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any
information.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br>
Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or
operated by third parties (each, a “<strong>Third Party Service</strong>”). Any information that
you provide on or to a Third Party Service or that is collected by a Third Party
Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third Party Service
and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not
responsible for the content, privacy, or security practices and policies of any
Third Party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully
review the privacy policies of all Third Party Service that you access.</p>
<p><strong>International Transfer</strong><br>
Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of
your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the
privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re
located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may
transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.</p>
<p><strong>Our Policy Toward Children</strong><br>
Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not
knowingly collect PII from children under age 13. If we learn that we have
collected PII of a child under the age of 13 we will take steps to delete such
information from our files as soon as possible.</p>
