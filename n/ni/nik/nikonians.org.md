# Privacy policies

###  Our privacy policies (updated 21-MAY-2018, in effect 21-MAY-2018)

We know it's very important that each user feels confident in our privacy policies, please take the time to read them. Should you have any questions about our privacy policies or our [terms of use](https://www.nikonians.org/about/terms-of-use), please do not hesitate [contacting us](https://www.nikonians.org/contact).

Our privacy policies relate to our sites, which are

nikonians.org with subdomains and nikoscope.com

We (or "us"), that is Nikonians EMEA Ltd, which operates our sites use "personal information" and "personal data" having the same meaning in the context of these privacy policies.

####  The type of personal information we collect and what we use it for

1\. As a visiting user of any of our sites we collect the following information: Access date & time, type of browser, country, domain name, IP address and which page is viewed. There is no correlation between this data and your registered user name, if you are a member. The data collected is anonymous and is not shared with any third party. This information is used for improving the content and design of our sites.

2\. By visiting Nikonians.org, a cookie will be stored in your browser to support forum related settings such as last read message. Nikonians.org may not provide full functionality if this cookie cannot be stored, specifically login to forums may not be possible.

3\. If you register as a member, we store your username, your full name, a password, state & country, email address, IP address used for registration and browser type. We do this to be able to provide you with the community services and to detect potential misuse.

You must use your real first and last name when you register. Accounts not using a real first and last name will be deleted. If you have strong incentives for not revealing your real name, you should contact us, best if prior to registering and we will help you. We have this real name policy since we launched in April 2000. The reason is that members automatically are more moderate when using a real name and trust is rather being built between members.

4\. If you fill out your user profile, which is optional, we store that information as well. The data in the profile can only be seen by other registered members. No one can see your email address, except administrators. This is done to improve the member-to-member trust and relationships.

5\. If you post a message in our forums, we store the IP address at the time you did the post. Only administrators can see this IP address. This is done to detect potential misuse.

6\. If you post a comment in the galleries, we store and show the IP address at the time of the comment. Any visitor can see this IP address. This is done to detect potential misuse.

7\. If you click on any link in our newsletters, we collect the date & time plus the subscription email address in use. This information is not related to your username in any way. We use this to improve the content of our newsletters, making them as interesting as possible for our readers.

8\. If you have enabled the Nikonians.org feature "Automatically login when I return" (See [My profile > Preferences > Community Settings](https://www.nikonians.org/forums/dcboard.php?az=nik_usermenu)), a cookie will be stored in your browser to allow you to automatically login to the community. If this cookie is not stored, automatic login is not working.
