# Privacy policies at Nikonians

We believe it's very important that each user feels confident in our privacy policies, hence we have compiled this privacy statement.

2\. By visiting any of our sites, a cookie (a small file) will be stored on your computer. Our sites may not provide full functionality if the cookie cannot be stored on your computer, specifically login to forums may not be possible.

3\. If you click on any advertisment or any link on our sites we collect the access date & time and IP address.

4\. If you register as a community member we store your first name, last name and email address.

5\. If you enter data into your user profile we store that information. The data in the profile can only be seen by other registered members. No member can see your email address. Administrators have access to your email address.

8\. As a registered user, you will receive email information from us from time to time, but this is then information pertaining directly to the community. We do not send out emails often, but when we do we feel that the information is important and that all registered users should be informed about that specific issue. If you don't want to receive any emails from our community, you may send us an email and we will remove your account. This also means that your registration at Nikonians is cancelled completely.

9\. If you subscribe to message threads in forums or to our newsletters, you will automatically receive emails. You can unsubscribe to these messages or newsletters at any time by following the directions in the email.

10\. If you request to be informed about answers on a message posted by you, you will automatically receive emails containing those answers.

11\. If you decide to post a comment in our blog system, you must register a username and email address with TypeKey authentication services, a system which is not related to Nikonians. More on their privacy statement at [typekey.com](http://www.sixapart.com/typekey/privacy)
