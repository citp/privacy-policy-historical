**3\. The Information We Collect:**   
We collect both non-personally identifiable information and personally identifiable information that you provide to us through the Communication Points.  
**  
Non-Personally Identifiable Information** is information that cannot be used to identify you or to contact you and is information not associated with a specific personal identity. It includes information that we collect automatically from you by tracking your use of the NIKON Websites by using technology and methodology that enables tracking, such as the use of cookies, and includes but is not limited to information, such as domain type, browser version, service provider, internet protocol address, time spent and web pages visited, as well as information searched for on our NIKON Websites. A “cookie” is a small file that a website transfers to the hard drive of a visitor’s computer for record keeping purposes. This tracking through the use of cookies will not by itself reveal anything to us about you personally or provide us with any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, e-mail address or other personally identifiable information. Non-personally identifiable information may also include information that you, at your option, voluntarily provide us through any of the other Communication Points and includes but is not limited to information such as your hobbies and interests, gender, age, level of education, photographic skill level as well as your purchases of and your experience with our products.

**Personally Identifiable Information** is information collected from the Communication Points that is associated with a person’s name or personal identity and can be used to identify or contact you. It includes but is not limited to such information as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, and credit/debit card information. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen.

**4\. How We Use Collected Information  
**NIKON uses collected information (both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information) to provide you with the goods, services or information that you request, and also to help us better understand the needs and interests of consumers so that we may more closely meet your needs. For example, we may use personally identifiable information to help you complete a transaction or order with us, to respond to your inquiries and requests, to provide and update you on our customer services and support, to notify you of promotional or special offers, to communicate with you about our products and services, to allow you to participate in an interactive feature, and/or to help us determine other NIKON products, services or information that may be of interest to you (see Section 10 below, “Your Privacy Preferences Regarding Personally Identifiable Information-Opting In/Out” regarding communications to you). Personally identifiable information in the form of credit/debit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention. We use non-personally identifiable information to increase the functionality and user friendliness of our NIKON Websites as well as to improve the design, content and visitor experience of all of our Communication Points. We may also use personally identifiable and/or non-personally identifiable information for research purposes such as analyzing how visitors use and navigate our NIKON Websites. In addition, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics, such as your name, that make the information personally identifiable to you, i.e., de-personalizing your information. Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on NIKON’s right to aggregate or de-personalize your personally identifiable information, and use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any way.

**5\. Who We Share Information With**  
NIKON does not sell, rent or lease any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. NIKON also does not share your personally identifiable information with third parties except we may disclose personally identifiable information to companies affiliated with NIKON, such as our parent company, and/or unaffiliated third parties working on our behalf or for us or with us, such as agents, service providers, shippers, vendors and suppliers, for the purposes of enabling them to fulfill your requests to us or your purchase of products, services or information, fulfillment of NIKON-related contests, sweepstakes, promotions and/or NIKON-related offers, assisting us in understanding your needs and interests so that we can better provide you with products, services or information, or for the other purposes discussed above in Section 4 of this Privacy Policy. All such affiliated and unaffiliated parties who have access to personally identifiable information are required by NIKON to keep confidential such information and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for NIKON and as otherwise required by law. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, NIKON will not share personally identifiable information with third parties without your permission, unless to (a) comply with any law, subpoena, regulation or court order; (b) respond to requests from governmental authorities; and/or (c) help prevent fraud or to protect the safety, rights, property or security of NIKON as well as that of third parties.

**6\. Links to Non-Nikon Owned Sites  
**The Communication Points may include links to and/or from other websites which are not owned by NIKON and are owned by companies or parties which are either affiliated or unaffiliated with NIKON (“Third Party Websites”). These links are provided to you as a matter of convenience and for informational purposes only. When you access links to or from a Third Party Website, you are not on a NIKON Website. We do not endorse or make any representations about Third Party Websites, and we are not responsible for and we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, as to the practices, privacy, content or security of such Third Party Websites. You are responsible for reviewing, and we encourage you to review the terms of use, privacy and any other policies of such Third Party Websites.

**7\. Our Commitment To Information Security**   
Information security is important at NIKON, and while no security measure is perfect or impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you provide to us, you can be assured that we maintain physical, electronic and administrative measures and safeguards and periodically review these security measures and safeguards to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized or inappropriate access and use.

**8\. Our Commitment To Children's Privacy**   
Our Communication Points are not directed at children, and we do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children under the age of thirteen. Should any parent or guardian discover that his/her child has provided personal information to NIKON, please e-mail [webmaster@nikon.net](mailto:webmaster@nikon.net) to have such information deleted from our records.

**9\. How To Access or Update Your Information  
**You can access, edit, delete and update any personally identifiable information that you provided to us through the Communication Points by visiting your profile page on [www.nikonusa.com](https://secure.nikonsso.com/). We use this procedure to better safeguard your personally identifiable information. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to edit or update your personally identifiable information.

**10\. Your Privacy Preferences Regarding Personally Identifiable Information-Opting In/Out  
**NIKON may use your personally identifiable information to send you information about NIKON products, services, promotions, events, firmware or software updates, and service advisories, as well as how to get more enjoyment from your NIKON products and photography, and any other purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless you inform NIKON that you do not wish to receive such information by contacting us at [Nikon Email Preferences](https://support.nikonusa.com/ci/documents/detail/2/eof) or by opting out at the appropriate Communication Site or by email communication. In addition, in the event you have opted out but in the future desire to receive information from NIKON, you may opt in by contacting us at [Nikon Email Preferences](https://support.nikonusa.com/ci/documents/detail/2/eof).

**11\. Changes in Policy**  
By visiting any of the Communication Points, or otherwise providing NIKON with your information, you consent to our collection and use of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. NIKON reserves the right to modify or supplement this Privacy Policy, including our collection and use and related business practices, at any time by posting updated text on our NIKON Websites. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective at the time they are posted to our NIKON Websites. For this reason, it is your responsibility and NIKON encourages you to review this Privacy Policy each time you visit any of our NIKON Websites.
