(a) Personal information that individual users provide through registration as paid subscribers and voluntarily at certain other points; and  
(b) tracking information, which is automatically collected about every visitor to the website paid subscribers.

2\. Subscriptions

a subscriber is not entitled to cancel his membership, and claim back his subscription. His membership automatically stands cancelled, once he does not renew his subscription next month.

Personal information is gathered for several ways. First, when a user registers for a paid subscription, he/she is required to provide his/her name, city of residence, email address and to select a login name.

Although all this information is generally entered into fields on a secured area of the website, subscribers can talk offline to our customer service representative and receive a computerized invoice by mail.

Wherever we collect personal information, we make an effort to include a link to our Privacy Policy on that page.
