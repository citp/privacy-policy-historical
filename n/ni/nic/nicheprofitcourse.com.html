Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Last Updated: January 4th, 2010</p>
<p>NicheProfitCourse.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet<br>
technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may<br>
use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street<br>
address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will<br>
never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party.<br>
Period.”</p>
<p>How we gather information from users</p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the<br>
activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For<br>
example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access<br>
to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or<br>
when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate<br>
in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other<br>
interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, NicheProfitCourse.com also collects<br>
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be<br>
transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet<br>
Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information<br>
from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and<br>
password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you<br>
visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular<br>
advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may<br>
also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose<br>
not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse<br>
to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of<br>
the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may<br>
not be able to customize the site’s features according to your preferences.</p>
<p>What we do with the information we collect</p>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and<br>
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and<br>
do not share your information with anyone.<br>
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may<br>
be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your<br>
usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help<br>
enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or<br>
what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be<br>
shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does<br>
not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to<br>
identify you individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on NicheProfitCourse.com to<br>
communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences;<br>
our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by<br>
NicheProfitCourse.com and other topics we think you might find of interest.<br>
Personally Identifiable Information collected by NicheProfitCourse.com may also be<br>
used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,<br>
troubleshooting, processing of ecommerce transactions, administration of<br>
sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third<br>
parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web<br>
hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your<br>
information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we<br>
continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other<br>
companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among<br>
the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a<br>
court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so<br>
by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to<br>
law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary.<br>
Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.<br>
Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements NicheProfitCourse.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the<br>
privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our<br>
partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through<br>
our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.<br>
For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a<br>
frame on a NicheProfitCourse.com page, certain content that is actually created or<br>
hosted by a third party. Also, through NicheProfitCourse.com you may be introduced to,<br>
or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes<br>
offered by other parties. NicheProfitCourse.com is not responsible for the actions or<br>
policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of<br>
those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a<br>
third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may<br>
use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences<br>
or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served<br>
by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine<br>
whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features<br>
available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use<br>
cookies or other technology to gather information. NicheProfitCourse.com does not<br>
control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and<br>
is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.<br>
You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable<br>
Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed<br>
publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge<br>
and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.<br>
Such activities are beyond the control of NicheProfitCourse.com and this policy.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>NicheProfitCourse.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable<br>
Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we<br>
discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of<br>
this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe<br>
NicheProfitCourse.com has any information from or about anyone under 13, please<br>
contact us at the address listed below.</p>

<p>Changes to this Policy</p>
<p>NicheProfitCourse.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please<br>
check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following<br>
the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.<br>
Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used<br>
according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was<br>
collected.</p>
<p>Governing law</p>
<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Washington law. If a dispute<br>
arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the help of a<br>
mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Washington. Any costs<br>
and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be shared<br>
equally by each of us.</p>
<p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through<br>
mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the following<br>
location: Washington, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.<br>
Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any<br>
court with jurisdiction to do so. nicheprofitcourse.com is controlled, operated and<br>
administered entirely within Washington. This statement and the policies outlined<br>
herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights<br>
