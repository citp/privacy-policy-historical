                            information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you 
                            elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked 
                            to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our 
                            site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. 
                            You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, 
                            message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like 
                            most Web sites, Nicheology.com also collects information automatically and through 
                            the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, 
                            we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology 
                            to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the 
                            cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter 
                            that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you 
                            encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional 
                            technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, 
                            you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your 
                            browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access 
                            certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and 
                            password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according
