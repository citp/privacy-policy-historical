# Nick | Privacy policy

Privacy policy

Dated January 2009

## 1\. What Is A Privacy Policy?

Nickelodeon's privacy policy is just Nickelodeon's way of telling you how Nickelodeon UK Ltd (a company incorporated in England registration number 2797365) of 15-18 Rathbone Place, London, W1T 1HU (or any successor and/or associated company) (Nickelodeon) will collect, store and use any information, which you provide to Nickelodeon, such as your name, age, address, and telephone number or anything else. It also tells you the choices you can make about how the information you provide to Nickelodeon is collected and used.

It is important you read through this policy and be sure to get your parent(s)/guardian(s) to read and discuss it with you.

And don't forget, you should always make sure you get the consent of your parent(s)/guardian(s) before giving any information or sending any materials to anyone, including Nickelodeon, whether online, by post or in any other way.

## 2\. The Legal And Important Bit

Nickelodeon promises to look after and control any information you send Nickelodeon, whether it's personal information (such as your name, address, date of birth or contact details) or other non-personal information (such as your nickname, your computer's address known as an IP address, views or comments).

So whether you register your details on Nickelodeon's websites, enter competitions, contact Nickelodeon by phone, send Nickelodeon SMS messages, interact with Nickelodeon through red-button applications, voting for your favourite things online or send Nickelodeon a letter in the post or provide Nickelodeon with your information any other way, this policy will apply, unless Nickelodeon tells you otherwise.

By providing Nickelodeon with your information, you (and your parent(s)/guardian(s)) agree to the terms of this policy. If you (or your parent(s)/guardian(s)) do not agree with this policy, please do not supply any information.

## 3\. Interacting With Nickelodeon

You can interact with Nickelodeon in a number of ways but if you want to interact with Nickelodeon online through Nickelodeon's websites, it is always a good idea for you and your parent(s)/guardian(s) to spend time online together for your safety and it may even be fun!

## 4\. Parent(s)'/Guardian(s)' Consent and Checks

If you are under 18, you will ALWAYS need to get your parent(s)/guardian(s) permission before contacting and interacting with Nickelodeon - whether it's entering one of Nickelodeon's competitions, sending Nickelodeon a letter or accessing Nickelodeon's websites, especially if you are providing Nickelodeon with personal information.

Nickelodeon may need to check that your parent(s)/guardian(s) are happy for you to provide your information to Nickelodeon. Where Nickelodeon does need to check with your parent(s)/guardian(s), Nickelodeon will ask you for your parent's/guardian's contact details (usually an email address or telephone number) so Nickelodeon can then contact them. 

Nickelodeon will always ask for your parent(s)'/guardian(s)' permission where Nickelodeon wants to use your personal information for marketing or research purposes; to send you Nickelodeon's newsletter or whether you are allowed to receive the prize and can comply with the competition terms and conditions, if you're lucky enough to be selected to win a competition.

Nickelodeon may also carry out checks to ensure that the contact details you have provided for your parent(s)/guardian(s) are your actual parent(s)/guardian(s). So no cheating!

## 5\. What Happens If Nickelodeon Does Not Receive My Parent(s)'/Guardian(s)' Consent?

If Nickelodeon:  
(a) finds out you've cheated;  
(b) discovers you've given Nickelodeon fake details for your parent(s)/guardian(s) - very naughty!!; or  
(c) Nickelodeon does not get a reply from your parent(s)/guardian(s) within a reasonable time (being approximately 5 weeks if you've asked to receive Nickelodeon's newsletter but for competitions, this time period will be a lot shorter, sometimes maybe only 24 hours);

Nickelodeon will not be able to use your information and will remove your information from Nickelodeon's database within a reasonable time.

This may affect the way you may interact with Nickelodeon so, for example, you won't be allowed to enter a competition; your use of Nickelodeon's websites may be limited; or you will not be able to receive any marketing materials.

## 6\. Why Does Nickelodeon Need Your Information?

A lot of the information Nickelodeon asks you to provide is to make sure you can enjoy all the benefits of Nickelodeon's websites or red-button applications or so Nickelodeon can tell you if you're lucky enough to win one of Nickelodeon's competitions.

You can, of course, ask Nickelodeon to remove your information at any time by contacting Nickelodeon.

## 7\. What Else Does Nickelodeon Do With Your Information?

The information you provide may be used for marketing and research; to provide and personalise Nickelodeon's service for you; and to send you newsletters and other information about Nickelodeon and our related products and services (marketing materials).

If you'd like to receive marketing materials from Nickelodeon such as Nickelodeon's newsletter, you can either write to Nickelodeon asking to receive marketing materials from Nickelodeon or you can choose to receive it by ticking the appropriate box when providing your details to Nickelodeon - for example, on Nickelodeon's websites, as part of the registration process or when entering a competition or otherwise.

It is your choice whether you'd like to receive these marketing materials or not and you can change your mind at any time by contacting Nickelodeon (as detailed below).

In order to ensure that any marketing materials, which Nickelodeon provides to you are likely to be of interest, Nickelodeon may also use information collected about you from cookies (as described below), surveys, household data and any correspondence between you and Nickelodeon, as well as information you provide when you register your details on Nickelodeon's websites.

Where Nickelodeon uses your personal information for such marketing materials, Nickelodeon will ask your parent(s)'/guardian(s)' permission first BUT where Nickelodeon does not use your personal information and just uses your non-personal information, Nickelodeon will not ask your parent(s)/guardian(s) for their permission.

## 8\. Who Else May Have Access To My Information?

Sometimes Nickelodeon needs third parties to carry out a service for it. For example if you win a competition, Nickelodeon may need to pass your information to a third party to arrange delivery of your prize or need advice from any auditor or legal adviser. Nickelodeon will make sure that these third parties keep your information secure; only keep the information for so long as is necessary; and will comply with all UK and EU legislation. 

Apart from the above, Nickelodeon will only pass on your information to third parties if:

  * Nickelodeon has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary for legal proceedings;
  * the information is generic and doesn't identify you, such as whether you're a boy or girl and how you watch Nickelodeon's programmes. Nickelodeon may use such information (in whole or in part) to identify trends and may pass this to third parties such as advertisers and business partners to give them a better understanding of Nickelodeon's business.



## 9\. International Use Of Your Information

As Nickelodeon and its associated companies operate throughout the world, it may be necessary to transfer your information outside of the UK or even Europe. If Nickelodeon needs to do this, Nickelodeon promises that any of Nickelodeon's associated companies will comply with UK and/or European law in respect of data protection and will comply with the terms of this policy.

## 10\. Cookies and IP Addresses - What Are They?

Cookies are small files of data that are downloaded onto your computer when you visit a website. They allow websites, such as Nickelodeon's websites, to remember your activities on that website and the number of times you have visited. Nickelodeon collects information through this technology to make Nickelodeon's website more interesting and useful to you. For instance, when you come to one of Nickelodeon's websites via your computer, Nickelodeon collects your IP address. At times, Nickelodeon also uses your IP address to collect information about how often you visit Nickelodeon's websites.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser settings. Each browser is different, so you may want your parent(s)/guardian(s) to help you and you'll probably need to take a look at your Help menu. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your web experience smoother and some of Nickelodeon's services may not work properly.

You may also get cookies from Nickelodeon's advertisers. Nickelodeon does not control these cookies, and once you have clicked on the advertisement and left Nickelodeon's website, this policy no longer applies.

## 11\. Links To Other Websites

When you're on one of Nickelodeon's websites, you may be directed to other sites where your information may be collected and this will be outside the control of Nickelodeon. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement on one of Nickelodeon's websites, it may take you from Nickelodeon's website to a third party's website. Nickelodeon cannot be responsible for or control the content on another party's website and don't forget that once you've left Nickelodeon's website, if you provide any information to the third party, you will need to check their privacy policy as this policy only applies to Nickelodeon websites.

It is important that you stay safe online and if you'd like more information about this then please talk to your parent(s)/guardian(s).

## 12\. Changes To This Policy

Nickelodeon may change this policy from time to time and will post the latest version on Nickelodeon's websites. If Nickelodeon wishes to use your information in a way which is incompatible with the information in this policy, Nickelodeon will contact you (and your parent(s)/guardian(s)) to get your consent. 

## 13\. Who Can I Contact?

If you and/or your parent(s)/guardian(s) want to discuss with Nickelodeon how your information is used; wish Nickelodeon to remove your information from Nickelodeon's records; or would like to update your information then please contact Nickelodeon at:
