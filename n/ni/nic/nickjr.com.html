Information Collection Policies<br>

</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NickJr.com’s target audience is parents of preschoolers (excluding the Playtime area, which is intended for preschoolers and their parents and which is governed by special information collection policies--please see below for more on the Playtime area) and the design, content and language, as well as our activities, target a parent audience. We do request personally identifiable information from parents who choose to participate in certain activities available on NickJr.com, as described below. If we were to discover that a child submitted personally identifiable information, NickJr.com would delete the information immediately. 
</font></font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#0066CC"><b>Registered Membership</b></font><br>
NickJr.com provides registered membership for our parent audience. In order to participate in our registered member activities, we ask users to submit personal information (e.g. full name, e-mail address, zip code, birthday.) All such personal information is collected for the purpose of providing our users access to NickJr.com's registered members activities. Once registered, users can participate in registered member activities such as newsletters, message boards, NickJr.com advisory board (where members will be contacted by NickJr.com for feedback and opinions on various subjects), registered member sweepstakes (refers to those sweepstakes that are open only to registered members; for sweepstakes that are open to all grown-up users, please see "General Activities: Online Sweepstakes" section below) and "Third Party" offers (the opportunity for registered members to receive information concerning special offers and promotions sent by either NickJr.com on behalf of or in partnership with other third party businesses selected by NickJr.com or directly by such third parties.) At any time after the registration process, registered members can choose to discontinue participating in some of the registered member activities (e.g. newsletters, NickJr.com advisory board, "Third Party" offers) or altogether unregister by electing to unsubscribe to such activity, which option can be found at the end of each NickJr.com correspondence sent to users. 
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
</font></p><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Use of Registered Members Information</b><br>
All information collected during the registration process is used for the purpose of providing our users access to NickJr.com's registered members activities. For instance, if the registered member selected to receive newsletters, special announcements, offers and promotions from Nickelodeon, we use the information provided by such registered member to send them the requested information which we may send by email and occasionally, by postal mail, for those who have provided us with mailing addresses. The information provided by registered members may also be shared with third parties as more fully described below in "Use of Information" and in the following manner. In connection with registered members who have selected to opt into "Third Party" offers, NickJr.com may sometimes share and transfer the personal information collected from our registered members with and to third party business partners selected by NickJr.com to promote, sponsor and/or fulfill our "Third Party" offers who will use such information to directly contact and send registered members special offers and promotions provided by the third party business partner. Other times, we on behalf of the third party business partner may send registered members third party special offers and promotions, but only if the registered member has selected to opt into "Third Party" offers.

When customers make purchases on NickJr.com (e.g. games from "Nick Jr. Arcade"), we require them to provide us with their full name, billing and/or shipping addresses, email address, and credit card number/expiration date. We also provide our customers the opportunity to send to family and friends gifts items purchased by the customer and will send, on behalf of customers who request it, emails to family or friends notifying them that someone has sent them a gift.
