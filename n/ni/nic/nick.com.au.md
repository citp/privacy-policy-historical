**5\. COOKIES**

  1. In some cases we may also collect your personal information through the use of cookies. Cookies are small text files that websites automatically save to the cookie file of the browser on your computer when you enter the website. When you access our websites, we may send a cookie to your computer.  This enables us to recognize your computer and greet you each time you visit our websites without bothering you with a request to register.  It also enables us to keep track of products or services you view so that, if you consent, we can send you news about those products or services.  We also use cookies to measure traffic patterns, to determine which areas of our websites have been visited and to measure transaction patterns in the aggregate.  We use this to research our users’ habits so that we can improve our online products and services.  If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser so that your computer does not accept them.
  2. We may log IP addresses (that is, the electronic addresses of computers connected to the internet) to analyze trends, administer the website, track users movements, and gather broad demographic information.
  3. We may use third party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our online services. By using such services, you consent to the processing of certain data about you as described within. The ads you receive may be influenced by various factors, including your browsing history prior to visiting this website. Third party advertising companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your use of our online services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements, our third party serving network may place or recognize a unique "cookie" (a text file) on your browser. The information stored in the cookie is used to reference information for standard reporting purposes such as delivered advertising campaigns or banners on websites that are using third party advertising companies as their ad serving system. This is a "persistent" cookie, which means that it is stored on your computer and will remain there until it expires or you remove it. While cookie and IP address information may be transferred to international responding data centres, only the cookie information of the requested ad domain is stored within the standard records. IP address information is obfuscated after being used to identify attributes associated with the IP address such as location (country, city) or bandwidth. The obfuscating of the IP address leads to anonymisation of the data. The ad serving networks may also make use of other technologies, such as "web beacons", in order to improve the relevance of the ads you receive. You have the option not to participate in third party advertising company analysis by selecting the appropriate setting on your browser. By using our online services, you acknowledge the third party advertising companies we use may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). If you are viewing our content from New Zealand, you can opt out of interest-based advertising delivered by such companies using cookies by clicking on <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> 
  4. You can use the "Help" section of the tool bar on most browsers to change the settings on your computer, for example to notify you when you receive a cookie, or to refuse all cookies. However, some of the features of our online services may not work or may be more difficult to access if you refuse all cookies. Further information about how cookies work can be found [here](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).
