	<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p><strong>(Last Revised: August 17, 2010)</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for visiting this web site. We understand the importance that Internet 
users place on privacy, and this Privacy Policy describes how we use personal information 
that is collected at this web site. Please read this Privacy Policy before using 
this site or submitting any personal information. By using this web site, you accept 
the privacy practices contained in this Privacy Policy. These privacy practices 
may change from time to time, but any changes will be posted. You are encouraged 
to review the Privacy Policy whenever you visit the web site to make sure you understand 
how any personal information you provide will be used.</p> 

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>In order to serve our customers, we collect personally identifiable information, like 
names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and sometimes credit card information 
when such information is voluntarily submitted by our visitors. We may use your 
personal information and transfer/exchange your personal information for any legal 
purpose, including, without limitation: (1) to deliver the products and/or services 
to you that you have requested; (2) to validate your compliance with the terms and 
conditions; (3) for content improvement and feedback purposes; (4) to reach you, 
when necessary, regarding your use of the web site or product(s); and (5) to bring 
retail opportunities and promotional offers to you by email, direct mail, telemarketing, 
and/or online banner advertising. When your information is provided to third parties, 
these third parties may include providers of direct marketing services and applications. 
We or these third parties may supplement the information we collect online with 
outside records to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, 
and/or to offer you targeted advertising and other opportunities to purchase products 
and services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p> 

<p>We will NEVER share your credit card information with third parties unless you have given us explicit permission 
to do so, such as in order to fulfill a third party offer that you have accepted 
from us. By permitting us to collect this information, you will be able to receive 
free information on products and services that may be of interest to you. You also 
enable us to personalize your experience with us so that we can provide you with 
the highest quality of service. By submitting your email address on this web site, 
you agree to receive email from us and our third party advertisers. We, and our 
third party advertisers, may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. 
You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking 
the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective 
email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either 
directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, 
because we hate spam as much as you do.</p> 

<p>In addition, you agree that by submitting your email address on this web site and/or registering to receive the product and/or 
service offered herein, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry, and/or an application 
for the purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (ATSR), 16 CFR '310 et 
seq. and any applicable state and local "do not call" regulations. We and our third 
party advertisers retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance 
with the ATSR and the applicable state regulations.</p> 

<h3>Third Party Actions</h3> 
<p>We do not control and are not liable for the actions of our third party marketers or advertisers. 
We pride ourselves in working with quality companies, but have no control over the 
actions of those third parties. While we are not liable for any of the actions of 
those third parties, you should feel free to give us feedback from time to time 
on your experiences with any third parties to whom we work with so that we may enhance 
our future service to all customers.</p> 

<h3>Cookies</h3> 
<p>We may use cookies to deliver content that is specific to your interests. Cookies are text files that are used by your 
computer's web browser to store your preferences, and enable us to enhance your 
user experience with our web site.</p> 

<h3>IP Addresses</h3> 
<p>We may use your IP address to help prevent fraud, to help diagnose problems with our server, to gather broad demographic 
information, and to offer you products and services.</p> 

<h3>Third Party Web Sites</h3> 
<p>This web site and/or the products and/or services offered herein may direct you to web 
sites that are owned and/or controlled by third parties. We have no control over 
those third parties and are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices 
of those sites or companies.</p> 

<h3>Commitment to Data Security</h3> 
<p>All information collected from you is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. We use SSL 
encryption to protect sensitive information online, and we do everything we can 
to protect user information offline. Unfortunately, no transmission over the Internet 
can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we take reasonable measures 
to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the information 
that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p> 

<h3>Contacting Us</h3> 
<p>If you need to contact us, you can email us at respond@nicabm.com, call us at 860-456-1153, or 
send us a letter at: PO Box 523, Mansfield Center, CT 06250.</p>

<p>We strive to provide 
excellent products, along with equally excellent customer service. If you have any 
questions about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please feel free to contact 
us using one of the methods listed above. </p>
