# www.nicksplat.com - Terms and Conditions of Use

**Privacy Policy**  
**Nickelodeon is totally committed to providing the safest and most secure environment for you to interact with us on the Net. That is why we will never give out your information to anyone else and promise to store your personal data in a safe and secure place !

The Nickelodeon website (www.nicksplat.com) is a place specially created for kids on the world wide web where they can get involved with the Nickelodeon Asia Pacific channel, express themselves and above all, play. 

At Nickelodeon, we encourage kids (and their parents or guardians) to get as much out of the website as possible, but want to ensure that all website visitors know as much as they can about protecting their private and personal information. 

********

1\. Do Not Give Out Your Personal Information to Unknown Sources **  
Kids! Never give out personal information to people you don’t know. Check with your parents or guardians before giving out anything you think might be personal information on any website. There’s no harm in checking first if you’re not sure!

**2\. Talk to your Parents or Guardians**  
Talk to them about the release of personal information and make sure you understand what are the reasons for giving it out are. Sometimes you might wish to give out personal information for good reasons. At other times, it might be unnecessary.

**What Information Is Collected At The website?**

  
At Nickelodeon Asia Pacific, it is our policy to create website content which requires minimum collection of information from our visitors. Generally, Nickelodeon Asia Pacific limits collection of information to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. first name, age, birthday, gender, city or town). This information is collected so kids can participate in activities without giving out unnecessary personal information. Where we need extra information, e.g. kids'/parents' email addresses, telephone numbers (as explained below) to run competitions or to offer extra on-line activities, we let kids know the reason for which we are collecting the information and what we will do with it. We do not as a condition to a kid's participation in any of our on-line activity require the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary. 

There are some areas of the website that ask kids to enter personally identifiable information. We have made this safer and easier for the child to use by establishing a Nick Name and Password facility. This requires the Child to enter in personally identifiable information only once at the time of registration, but after that they only require to put in their Nick Name and Password. This personal information is added to the Nickelodeon database and is used for the purpose of fulfilling prizes, mailing/emailing newsletters and birthday cards, emailing our Nicksclusive newsletters and for other Nickelodeon marketing purposes. The personal information is not on sold to any third party. It is not displayed anywhere in the website.

**1\. Registration  
**The main way we collect personally identifiable information is through our registration process. In order to take part in our registered member activities, we ask kids to submit personal information such as full name, email address, postcode and birthday and we ask each kid if they wish to opt-in to receiving emails from us as part of our activities for registered members e.g. our newsletter. We remind them to ask a parent/guardian for permission first. The information is used to allow kids to take part in registered member activities such as message boards, newsletters, any special member competitions and send postcards. Registered kids can unsubscribe at any time. 

All such personal information collected during the registration process is used only for the purpose of providing kids with access to our registered member activities. It is not currently our policy to use such information for general marketing purposes or to share such information with third parties (except in relation to competitions as set out below or where we are required to do so by law or in the context of a business transfer). Should our policy on this change, we will let you know and give you the choice to be included. 

We do not obtain or require disclosure of sensitive personal data (such as ethnic origin or religion) but if you choose to provide us with such sensitive personal data, we may assume such sensitive personal data is provided with your express consent for processing by us for the purposes for which such personal data was provided by you unless otherwise notified by you to us in writing in the ******[feedback form](https://web.archive.org/contact.html)**.

**2\. Competitions  
**We offer the opportunity to all kids to enter competitions on-line. In order to run competitions and send out prizes, it is necessary to collect some personally identifiable information from kids. This can include name, address and telephone number. As a matter of policy, we keep such information only for the purposes of administering the competition and do not disclose such information to third parties except where necessary to fulfill the prizes (e.g. it may be shared with fulfillment houses for processing purposes). We may from time to time offer competitions sponsored by third party businesses and may share entrant information with such businesses in order to fulfill the competition only. We will provide potential entrants with the opportunity to opt-in to such third party sponsored competitions. Once a competition is finished, we will delete any personal information collected via on-line entry forms from our systems and it is not kept for any longer than is necessary.

**3. Nic** **ksplat.com E-cards**   
Nicksplat.com E-cards are animated e-postcards that kids can send to friends and family. We do not collect our visitors' full names, but we do collect email addresses during this process in order to inform the user that their postcard has been read. We also ask users to submit their friends' email addresses so we can send them these e-cards. We think it would be disproportionate to inform user’s friend(s) about our privacy policy and how we will be using their personal data beforehand because it would spoil the surprise of receiving the friend’s electronic postcard. However, we can reassure users that this data is not transferred to a third party or used for marketing purposes and it is not kept for any longer than is necessary. 

**4\. Nick Blogs** **and Message Blogs**  
The Nick Blogs at Nicksplat.com site is intended for kids and we will not knowingly collect personal information from adults who pose themselves as kids. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under age 13 who has become a member of our website, please fill in the **[feedback form](https://web.archive.org/contact.html)** to notify us of a suspected violation.

The nature of blogging is to reach a public audience. Please be aware that any information that you submit to us whether through message boards, picture uploads, blogs, feedback and e-mail, including personally identifiable information, may be publicly displayed on Nicksplat.com, or on websites not within our control. If you don’t want others to see such information, do not submit it. 

**5\. Feedback  
**We provide kids with the opportunity to email us with their opinions and comments. We request no personally identifiable information unless the kid indicates that he or she wants us to reply. In these circumstances, we ask for a first name and email address. This information is used solely by us in order to give requested feedback and is then deleted from our system periodically

**6\. Security  
**We have taken steps to ensure that all personally identifiable information that we collect is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers as well as electronic security systems and password protections, which guard against unauthorised access.
