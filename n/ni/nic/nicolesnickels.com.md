# Disclaimer/Disclosure/Privacy Policy

**Disclaimer**

Many of you will not be surprised that I am including a Disclaimer on my website. Most of this is obvious but this website is intended for personal enjoyment. I will try to post deals and offers that are valid but cannot guarantee that any particular thing that I mention is something that is still available or that you will qualify for. I do not endorse any of the companies I mention but will give background as to whether or not I have been successful and/or had any issues with the company. If you choose to sign up for something I am in no way responsible for your relationship with the company. I am neither the agent, the representative, nor the employee of any company mentioned on this blog and as such am in no way liable for any damages or issues resulting from your relationship with them. I do promise to give the most updated and reliable information as possible and if a link doesn’t work or an offer is dead, please leave a comment or email me through the “contact me” box.

All external links from this website are not in my control or endorsed by me and therefore any and all information you submit on these other sites is at your own risk. I cannot guarantee that the claims made or goods promised on another website are valid and that you will receive what you sign up for.

This site gives no warranties (whether expressed or implied), and is not responsible for damages incurred by the users of this site. All information is provided as is, and all trademarks are property of their respective owners.

Please be advised that when you sign up for offers or freebies you may begin to get many emails for additional offers, freebies, etc. These emails are not spam as you likely requested these emails in your sign-up for the service and are the company’s way to promote their products. If they become bothersome to you, you should check with the service on how to unsubscribe
