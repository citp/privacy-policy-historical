                NiceHash Mining Software and NiceHash Mobile applications (collectively, "    <strong>NiceHash Services</strong>") or otherwise interact with us as
                described below. We are compliant with applicable laws in the countries in
                which we operate. By using the NiceHash Services or interacting with us as

                the Privacy Policy whenever you access or use NiceHash Services to stay
                informed about our information practices and your privacy rights and
                choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect

            </p>
            <p>
                The types of information we may collect are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul type="square">

                    hashing power for order, payments, number, duration, modification and
                    termination of orders and other order parameters;</li>
                <li>All information associated with selling hashing power and the provision

                non-personal information with personal information, the combined
                information will be treated as personal information for as long as it
                remains combined.
