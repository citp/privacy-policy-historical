Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (that is, without identification of the individual user) <br> or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.<br><br>

<b>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? </b><br>We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors.

We do not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information given to them.<br>
