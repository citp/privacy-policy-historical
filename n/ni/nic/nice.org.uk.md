### Adoption and impact reference panel

The Adoption and Impact Reference Panel is an advisory body to NICE. The purpose of the panel is to review and comment on tools and resources produced by NICE and to provide ad-hoc independent expert opinion if needed.

When you join the panel we ask you to provide your name, job details and contact information. We also ask you about your areas of interest so that our contact with you can be tailored to your expertise.

We ask for this information so we can administer membership of the panel and so that we know we have a wide variety of experts to work with to ensure our tools and resources are fit for purpose.

We will use your details to contact you (via email or phone) about one, or more of the following:

  * to provide us with a user perspective on draft resources and other products in line with your interests and expertise;
  * contribute to formal consultation exercises for draft tools and resources and to provide rapid and brief informal feedback;

  * provide us with expert advice on the levers and barriers to implementation of our guidance, we may also;


  * notify you of other opportunities to work with NICE related to your interests.



We ask you to fill out declarations of interest forms as the panel is intended to provide independent and impartial views on tools and resources that have been developed to support specific guidance topics. We also ask you to sign a confidentially form to show you have agreed to what is set out in that particular document.

We will send you an annual statement which you can use in your professional development portfolio to demonstrate your contribution to the development of our guidance.

Any comments you provide during your time on the panel will either be incorporated into the tool or resource or a reason recorded for not including them. We keep a written record of how each comment is dealt with and will make this available to you upon request, following the publication of the tools.

### Audience insight community

The purpose of the audience insight community is to ensure the views, experiences, needs and expectations of NICE's current and potential audiences are systematically gathered and interpreted to support product and service planning, development and evaluation.

If you join the audience insight community you will be asked for your name, email and telephone number so we can contact you. We will also ask you questions about your background, for example, your area of work and job role. We ask for this information so we can inform you about research most relevant to you.

We use third-party supplier SNAP Survey to administer our surveys, for more information about how they process personal data please see their [privacy notice](https://www.snapsurveys.com/gdpr/).

We rely on your consent to process your data – if you no longer wish to participate in the audience insight community you can withdraw consent at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the emails you are sent or contact us at [AudienceInsight@nice.org.uk](mailto:AudienceInsight@nice.org.uk).

### Citizen’s Council

It is important to NICE that the Citizens Council broadly reflects the demographics of the UK adult population. We ask for personal data during member recruitment to assess demographic suitability and ensure Council diversity. We also use personal data to monitor and ensure demographic diversity for individual meetings and other Citizens Council activities.

We use contact information for communications about arrangements for Citizens Council meetings, reports and other Council activities. Names, and occasionally photographs, of members who attend a Citizens Council meeting are published in the corresponding meeting report, available on the NICE website. As Citizens Council reports are prepared by an independent report writer, names or photographs of members who attended that particular meeting may be shared with the report writer prior to publication as part of the drafting process.

The overall demographic profile of the Citizens Council may be shared with third parties, for example in order to respond to general enquiries, Freedom of Information requests, or to share best practice with other organisations. In such cases the data will be anonymised (name and contact information removed) and the profile will not provide demographic information for individual members, only the Council as a whole.

For Citizens Council members, we keep different types of personal data for different lengths of time. Any names and photographs that are publicly available within Citizens Council reports are retained indefinitely. Contact information and unpublished photos are held for up to five years after a member’s last involvement with NICE. Demographic information is held permanently so that we can monitor any changes in the demographic profile of the Citizens Council over time.

The legal basis we rely on to process your data is Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR ‘…exercise of official authority…’ 

### Meetings in public

We hold a number of meetings in public as part of our commitment to having processes in place that are rigorous, open and transparent.

If you register to attend a meeting held in public we will ask for your name and contact details. We need this data so we can provide you with information about the event you are registering for.

We also ask about any special needs or requirements you have (for example any mobility issues or the use of hearing loops) that we should know about to ensure your safety and comfort.

If you are attending a public board meeting, please note that we use a third-party supplier to help us coordinate these events, the information you supply will be passed to them for this purpose. They are required to hold this data securely and cannot use it for any other purpose.

After you have attended a meeting we may also send you a feedback form so you can tell us about your experience and help us make any improvements. The feedback is anonymous and you cannot be identified.

Two months after the meeting we will delete your personal data.

The legal basis we rely on to process your data is Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR ‘…exercise of official authority…’ 

### Registering as a stakeholder and commenting on consultations

All of our guidance, quality standards, and other products are developed taking into account the opinions and views of the people who will be affected by them, including patients, carers and members of the public, as well as health and social care professionals, NHS organisations, industry, social care businesses and local government.

Back to top

### Consultations

Our consultation process allows a range of individuals and organisations to comment on our recommendations throughout the development of our guidance and quality standards.

If you comment via the NICE website, depending on the product you are commenting on may be asked to give your name and your email address.   We may use this data to:

  * send you an email to inform you that you are eligible to comment
  * contact you about the product you are commenting on
  * send you a confidentiality acknowledgement and undertaking form.



### Stakeholders

Our guidance is created by independent and unbiased advisory committees that include a diverse range of experts from surgeons and midwives, to health economists and social workers, as well as patients or carers or other members of the public.

In the case of our technology appraisals and highly specialised technologies guidance, in which we make recommendations about the use of new drugs and technologies within the NHS, we work with manufacturers to ensure that evidence they submit on the effectiveness of their products is the most appropriate to enable an evaluation to be undertaken.

We value the input of patients, carers and the general public in the development of our guidance and other products. By involving the people for whom the guidance will be relevant, we put the needs and preferences of patients and the public at the heart of our work.

Our Public Involvement Programme supports individual patients, carers and members of the public, as well as voluntary, charitable and community organisations involved with NICE's work.

If you register as a stakeholder, we ask for your name, job title, and contact details.  We do this so that we can check your suitability to be a stakeholder, keep you updated on the development of the guidance, and seek your input at key stages.

If you are a manufacturer and register as a stakeholder, we ask for contact details for the person who will be our main contact, and details of the person who we can ask about technical questions about the product.  

We ask for this information so that we can keep you updated on the development of the guidance and seek your input at key stages.  We may share your contact details with colleagues so that they can provide additional support

Once published, all NICE guidance is regularly considered for review, and updated in light of new evidence, if necessary.  When we conduct a review we may email you to:

  * Inform you that the review is starting and see if you would like to register again as a stakeholder. If you do, we will:
  * Send you the review proposal for consultation
  * Send you the review decision



The legal basis we rely on to process your data is Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR ‘…exercise of official authority…’ 

When you register as a stakeholder we will ask you if you would like to hear about other NICE work. This is so we can ensure we only contact you about areas of NICE work that you have an interest in.

### Student champions

As part of our education work, we run the NICE Evidence search student champion scheme (NICE ES SCS). You can find out more about the scheme [here](https://www.nice.org.uk/get-involved/student-champions).

If you are a student champion we ask for your name and email address so that our SCS staff can keep in touch with you and support you throughout your time on the scheme. We also need to be able to send you things like the tools you need to develop, plan and deliver your own hands-on learning sessions for your fellow students.

We ask for your home address so that we can send you hard copy certificates. This is not an essential part of the scheme, so if you do not want to provide this data, you don’t have to, but it will mean that we can’t post certificates to you. You will be asked to opt in to this when you complete your final reflective reports.

If you attend a student champion led session, you’ll be given a link to a pre- and post-session survey by your school’s academic lead or the student champions. These surveys ask for your name and email address, this is so we can email you a certificate of participation. Again this is optional.

As part of the survey we ask if you are happy for us to use your email address to contact you about your experience with Evidence Search, this is optional.

You will also have the option of whether or not your anonymised answers are included in our report

We will hold the information of student champions for 2 years after your participation in the scheme has come to an end.

If you attended a workshop and provided us with your contact details – we will delete these 18 months after sending you a survey and/or contacting you for feedback.

If you fill in one of our surveys please note that we use Survey Monkey, their servers are hosted in the USA – further information about how they process data can be found [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy-policy/).

If you would like more information about the information your University holds about you, please contact them directly.

For student champions we rely on Article 6(1)(b) – ‘processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract’.

If you are a workshop attendee the legal basis we rely on to process your personal data is your consent under article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR.

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at [studentchampions@evidence.nhs.uk](mailto:studentchampions@evidence.nhs.uk)

### Joint Information Group

The Joint Information Group (JIG) brings together information specialist representatives from NICE, organisations contracted by NICE, and from related organisations.

If you join the group as a representative you will be asked to provide your name and email address. This information will be used to subscribe you to the Joint Information Group mailing list (JIG@jiscmail.ac.uk) so that you receive communications about meetings and related activities.

More information about how JiscMail process your data can be found [here](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/policyandsecurity/#10).

If you no longer wish to be part of the group you can unsubscribe from the JIG list at any time [here](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?SUBED1=JIG&A=1) –  if you have changed role/ organisation we would encourage you to contact Janette Boynton at NICE so we can ensure a new representative from your organisation is invited to the group.

#### Stakeholder updates

Twice a year JIG representatives will ask all relevant organisations to supply a ‘stakeholder update’ for the group, for example, about any IS-related projects they have been working on and to include contact details where relevant. Stakeholder updates will be circulated to the full NICE IS network. This includes to ISs working at the following organisations: NICE, EPPI-Centre, External Assessment Centres (medical technologies), InterTASC ISSG/External Assessment Groups (diagnostics), National Guideline Alliance, National Guideline Centre, Public Health England and to members of the Cochrane Information Retrieval Methods Group. The purpose of including a contact name and email address is to enable members of the network to engage with each other about projects and developments.

The legal basis we rely on for processing your personal data is Article 6(1)(f) ‘…for the purposes of the legitimate interests…’

### Field team

We use a Microsoft Dynamics customer relationship management system to process data, including personal data. The types of personal data we collect are name, job title and contact information. This data is used to help us plan, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of our engagement programmes and improve the service we offer.

We may provide anonymised feedback to internal teams within NICE and on occasion may provide personal contact details to internal teams within NICE to:

  * help them to evaluate similar NICE products, services and programmes to those we have engaged with you about
  * raise awareness of and send invitations to events organised, or supported by NICE, again only for related topics



We routinely delete personal data 3 years after the last time that we have engaged with the individual that it relates to.

## Our products

We use lots of data to inform our products and help us make decisions, some of the data we use is personal data. Instances where we use identifiable and/or pseudonymised data are detailed below.

Information about how your confidential patient data is used in the health and care system for reason beyond your individual care, along with the choices you have about whether you want your data to be used in this way can be found in the ‘national data opt-out’ section, under the ‘your rights’ heading.

### Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)

[HES data](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics) contains details of all admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England.

At NICE we use pseudonymised HES data to help inform reports, templates and statements that sit alongside our guidance. These implementation tools detail the potential impact of implementing guidance on NHS finances and other resources (workforce, capacity and demand, infrastructure and training and education). Many of these outputs are published on our website – we do not publish or share it with third parties.

We obtain HES data from [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/) under a Data Sharing Agreement (DSA). We are the data controller for the information we process under this DSA.

The types of data we process include:

  * clinical information about diagnoses and operations
  * patient information, such as age group, gender and ethnicity
  * administrative information, such as dates and methods of admission and discharge
  * geographical information such as where patients are treated and the area where they live



We routinely delete HES data after 12 months, HES data in a publishable format is retained for as long as it has business value.

The legal basis we rely on to process this data is Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR ‘…exercise of official authority…’ 

And for the processing of special category data Article 9(2)(j) of the GDPR ‘…statistical purposes…’

## Working for or with us

NICE is the data controller for the information you provide during the recruitment process and your employment unless otherwise stated.

### Staff

#### Application stage

The information you provide during the recruitment process will only be used for the purpose of progressing your application, or to fulfil legal or regulatory requirements if necessary.

We ask you for your personal details including name and contact details. We will also ask you about your previous experience, education, referees and for answers to questions relevant to the role you have applied for. You will be asked to complete a criminal records declaration to declare any unspent convictions.

We will use the contact details you provide to us to contact you to progress your application.

The other information we ask for is used to assess your suitability for employment. You don’t have to provide what we ask for but it might affect your application if you don’t. 

We also ask for you to provide us with equal opportunities information, this is data about things like your racial or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender and sexual orientation. This is not mandatory information – if you don’t provide it, it will not affect your application. It is not part of the recruitment process and it is used to produce anonymised statistics on our recruitment process as part of our duties under equalities legislation.

#### NHS Jobs

If you submit an application to NICE using [NHS Jobs](https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/) the information you supply will be processed by NHS BSA, who managed this process on behalf of NICE.

More information about how the data you supply on NHS jobs is processed can be found [here](https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/privacy.html).

#### Shortlisting using TRAC

Once you have submitted an application NHS BSA transfer data from NHS jobs onto [TRAC](https://admin.trac.jobs/), a web-based system that we use to manage recruitment.

TRAC, data is shared as follows:

HR recruitment manager – this job role as NICE has access to all the data you submitted as part of your application on NHS jobs, this includes equality monitoring data. Please note the HR recruitment manager is not involved in candidate selection.

The recruitment panel (those who shortlist applicants) will have access to your application apart from your name, contact details, and equality monitoring information. The recruitment panel is usually made up of 3 staff members.

If you are successful at shortlisting and invited to interview, the recruitment panel will then have access to your name and contact details. At no point does the recruitment panel see the equality monitoring information.

#### Assessments

We might ask you to participate in assessment days; complete tests and/or to attend an interview – or a combination of these. Information will be generated by you and by us. For example, you might complete a written test or we might take interview notes. This information will be collected in hardcopy and then scanned and uploaded to TRAC.

In the case of recruitment to some senior posts, you may be asked to participate in a psychometric test. We use 3rd party ERAS to carry out these tests. The reports generated by ERAS are shared with NICE’s senior HR business partners, these are distilled into a short summary before being shared with the recruitment panel.

If you are unsuccessful following assessment for the position you have applied for your data will be deleted from TRAC 200 days after the after the post you have applied for has been filled. Any other data we hold will be deleted after 6 months.  We may ask if you would like your details to be retained, if you say yes, we may contact you should any further suitable vacancies arise. 

If you are successful, data collected at your assessment and uploaded to TRAC will be shared with NHS BSA. We do this so NHS BSA can include this data in your recruitment file which they send to relevant staff in the NICE HR and payroll team.

#### Offer of employment

If we make a conditional offer of employment we will ask you for information so that we can carry out pre-employment checks. You must successfully complete pre-employment checks to progress to a final offer. We are required to confirm the identity of our staff and their right to work in the United Kingdom. We also need to check that you hold the relevant qualifications required and our Code of Conduct requires all staff to declare if they have any potential conflicts of interest, or if they are active within a political party. You will be required to provide: 

  * Proof of your identity and right to work in the UK– you will be asked to attend our office with original documents and we will take copies of these.
  * Proof of any essential qualifications – you will be asked to attend our office with original documents and we will take copies of these.
  * A declaration of interests
  * We will contact your referees, using the details you provide in your application, directly to obtain references.



We will also ask you to complete a questionnaire about your health. This is to establish your fitness to work –see the  occupational health  section for more information.

If we make a final offer, we will also ask you for the following:

  * Bank details – to process salary payments
  * Emergency contact details – so we know who to contact in case you have an emergency at work
  * Membership of an NHS Pension scheme – so we can send you a questionnaire to determine whether you are eligible to re-join your previous scheme.



If you accept a final offer from us, some of your personnel records will be held on the Electronic Staff Record (ESR), this is a HR and finance records system. The rest of your data will be held on NICE’s network drive with restricted access.

#### Occupational health

We are joint data controllers with our use third-party supplier Health Assured to supply our occupational health service. They also supply our employee assistance service. If we make you a conditional offer, we will ask that you complete a questionnaire which will help to determine if you are fit to undertake the work that you have been offered, or advise us if any adjustments are needed to the work environment or systems so that you may work effectively.

We will send you a link to the questionnaire which will take you to Health Assured’s website. The information you provide will be held by Health Assured who will provide us with a fit to work certificate or a report with recommendations. With your consent this report will be shared with relevant members of staff.

If an occupational health assessment is required, you will be asked to provide your consent before being referred.

If during your employment with NICE you access our employee assistance programme Health Assured may ask for your name and email address – none of this data will be disclosed to NICE. Health Assured only supply us with anonymised, usage statistics.

For more information about how Health Assured process your data, please see their [privacy notice](https://www.healthassured.org/gdpr/).

#### Agency workers

For temporary vacancies, we use relevant recruitment agencies approved by Crown Commercial Services.

As the employment relationship is with the agency, we only hold limited data about agency workers – this may include CV’s sent by your agency and notes made about you if you attended an interview with us.

Data relating to HR and payroll is held by the agency. For more information about how individual recruitment agencies process your data, please visit their websites or contact them directly.

## Your rights

Under Regulation 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) and other information rights laws, you have rights as an individual which you can exercise in relation to the information we hold about you.

You can read more about these rights [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/).

## Access to your personal data

We will be as open as possible when it comes to giving you access to your personal data. You can find out if we hold any personal data about you by making a ‘subject access request’ under the General Data Protection Regulation. If we do hold information about you we will:

  * give you a description of it;
  * tell you why we are holding it;
  * tell you who it could be disclosed to; and
  * let you have a copy of the information in an intelligible form.



To make a request for any personal data we may hold you need to put the request in writing addressing it to our [Data Protection Officer](mailto:DPO@nice.org.uk), or writing to the address provided below.

If we do hold information about you, you can ask us to correct any mistakes by, once again, contacting the [Data Protection Officer](mailto:DPO@nice.org.uk).

## Disclosure of personal data

In most circumstances we will not disclose personal data without consent. However, there may be circumstances when we need to, for example to comply with the law.

We will not share your information with any third parties for the purposes of direct marketing.

We use data processors who are third parties who provide some service for us. We have noted above where we use third parties. We have contracts in place with our data processors. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will not share your personal information with any organisation apart from us. They will hold it securely and retain it for the period we instruct. 

## Freedom of Information

The Freedom of Information Act 2000 provides a right of access to recorded information held by public authorities and sets out exemptions to that right of access, for example, if the information is confidential.

If you would like to find out more, please see our [freedom of information page](https://www.nice.org.uk/freedom-of-information).

## National data opt out

We are one of many organisations working in the health and care system to improve care for patients and the public.

Whenever you use a health or care service, such as attending Accident & Emergency or using Community Care services, important information about you is collected in a patient record for that service. Collecting this information helps to ensure you get the best possible care and treatment.

The information collected about you when you use these services can also be used and provided to other organisations for purposes beyond your individual care, for instance to help with:

  * improving the quality and standards of care provided
  * research into the development of new treatments
  * preventing illness and diseases
  * monitoring safety
  * planning services



Most of the time, anonymised data is used for research and planning so that you cannot be identified in which case your confidential patient information isn’t needed.

You have a choice about whether you want your confidential patient information to be used in this way. If you are happy with this use of information you do not need to do anything. If you do choose to opt-out your confidential patient information will still be used to support your individual care.

To find out more or to register your choice to opt out, please visit [www.nhs.uk/your-nhs-data-matters](http://www.nhs.uk/your-nhs-data-matters).

We do not process any identifiable patient data at NICE and are in compliance with the national data opt-out policy.

Information about how we use pseudonymised data can be found under the ‘our products’ section of this privacy notice.
