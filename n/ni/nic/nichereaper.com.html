<div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>The
 following describes the Anti-Spam Policy for our 
https://mattg.com website which is owned/operated by Matt Garrett Ltd..</strong></p><p></p><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>What Is Spam?
</strong></div><div><strong></strong><br></div><div>Spam is unsolicited 
email, also known as junk mail (received via email), or UCE (Unsolicited
 Commercial Email). Virtually all of us have opened the inbox of an 
email account and found emails from an unknown sender. By sending email 
only to those who have requested to receive it, we at Matt Garrett Ltd.
 are following accepted permission-based email guidelines.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What About The Laws Against Spam?
</strong></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>They exist. However, as with any body of laws,
 any individual State spam statutes can and will vary. The spam laws of 
each State can not only vary, but also have different definitions of 
unsolicited commercial email. Additionally, there may be various federal
 agencies keeping track of spam, including the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC). At the Federal level, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 promulgates some 
attempt at a coherent and unified approach to unsolicited commercial 
email. Ultimately, it would be difficult to enforce spam law violations 
on any consistent or pervasive basis, so your own vigilance is your own 
best first line of defense. </div><div><br></div><div>Beyond that, we 
protect you by ensuring that you are 100% in control of whether or not 
you ever hear from Matt Garrett Ltd. by email initially or in the 
future, as detailed in our “No Tolerance” policy below.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Our No Tolerance Anti-Spam Policy
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><strong></strong></div><div><strong>WE HAVE A NO TOLERANCE SPAM POLICY. </strong>We
 do not email unless someone has filled out an "opt in" form or 
"webform" expressing an interest in our information or products and/or 
services, or otherwise directly and proactively requesting it. News of 
the features and benefits of Membership is spread through advertising, 
joint venture marketing, and word of mouth, so we are only building 
relationship with folks who wish to learn more about what we have to 
offer and willingly subscribe to our content and contact through email. 
You are always completely in control of whether you receive email 
communication from Matt Garrett Ltd., and can terminate at any time.
</div><div><br></div><div>NOTE - Every auto-generated email contains a 
mandatory unsubscribe link that cannot be removed. Therefore, each 
communication generated by Matt Garrett Ltd. carries with it the option
 to "unsubscribe" and never receive another email communication from Matt Garrett Ltd..

 with any of our administrative and legal notice pages, the contents of 
this page can and will change over time. Accordingly, this page could

<div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>The
 following describes the Federal Trade Commission Compliance for our 
https://mattg.com website which is owned and operated by Matt Garrett Ltd..</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We make 
every effort regarding any products or services we use, recommend, or 
otherwise make mention of at Matt Garrett Ltd.. We strive to clearly 
differentiate between our own products or services versus those of third
 parties, to facilitate inquiries, support, and customer care. Likewise,
 just as we (and any other legitimate business) may profit from the sale
 of our own products or services, we may also profit from the sale of 
others’ products or services (like any retailer) at Matt Garrett Ltd.. 
Additionally, wherever products or services may give rise to income 
generation, we endeavor to provide realistic and factual data, but 
highlight the fact that the variables impacting results are so numerous 
and uncontrollable that no guarantees are in any way made. It is our 
goal to embrace the guidelines and requirements of the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) for the benefit of all, and with that in mind provide 
the following disclosures regarding compensation and disclaimer 
regarding earnings &amp; income.&nbsp;</span></p><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>Note that material connections may not be made known
 at every single advertisement or affiliate link. Thus, to be safe, you 
should simply assume there is a material connection and that we may 
receive compensation in money or otherwise for anything you purchase as a
 result of visiting this website, and also that we may be paid merely by
 you clicking any link.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Amazon</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><br></div><div>One or more parties affiliated or 
associated with our Matt Garrett Ltd. website in some way may be an 
Amazon affiliate. This means that links to products on Amazon.com, as 
well as reviews leading to purchases, can result in a commission being 
earned. Again, disclosure of this material connection and the potential 
for compensation may not be made at every single possible opportunity. 
To be safe, simply assume there is a material connection and potential 
for compensation at all times. While this does not imply skewed or 
unduly biased reviews, full disclosure calls for this warning.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Compensation &nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 should assume that we may be compensated for purchases of products or 
services mentioned on this Matt Garrett Ltd. website that are not 
created, owned, licensed, or otherwise materially controlled by us. 
Stated differently, while most people obviously understand that 
individuals make a living by way of the profit that remains after the 
costs associated with providing their product or service are covered, at
 least theoretically there may be someone out there who does not 
understand that a third party can "affiliate" someone else's products or
 services and be compensated by the product or service creator/owner for
 helping spread the word about their offering. Just compare it to 
retailers. They seldom produce anything, but rather make their money 
connecting product and service creators with end users.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>Admonition
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Having said that, you cannot count on
 anyone looking after your interests but you. So, you ought to always do
 your own research into various offers and opportunities, to the extent 
that leaves you comfortable, doing your own due diligence prior to 
making any purchase of any product or service from this Matt Garrett Ltd. website or any other. Here is a great set of guidelines for you
 to keep in mind:
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">First,
 just always operate from the position that any website proprietor, 
including us at Matt Garrett Ltd., will have a material connection to 
the product or service provider, and may be compensated as a result of 
your purchase, unless expressly stated otherwise. Aside from your 
purchases, note that even you actions could result in earnings for this 
website. For instance, there could be ads displayed on this Matt Garrett Ltd. website that we are compensated for displaying whenever a 
website visitor clicks on them.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Second,
 to the extent that we have every interest in positively furthering our 
business relationship with you, we certainly desire to share only those 
offerings that we believe will benefit you. Just because we are not the 
founder or originator of the product or service, we are not going to 
withhold knowledge of this offering from you. If you can get some 
benefit from it, regardless of whether or not you've taken advantage of 
our own products and/or services, we want you to do well. Thus, we make a
 good faith effort to only present to you items that we either 
personally use, have actually tried, or else have faith in the 
reputation of the provider or concept. You can count on us making this 
determination based on all relevant and applicable information at the 
time of the recommendation.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Third,
 despite the fact that it would be counterproductive to mention products
 or services that you'll find disappointing or inferior, not only are 
people different, but it’s also possible for us to have a lapse in 
judgment. Thus, to be extra cautious, even if you believe in our good 
faith motives, you may as well go ahead and keep in mind that we could 
be at least partially influenced by the monetization factor of listing 
various products or services on our Matt Garrett Ltd. website. 
Furthermore, in that vein, the reality is that there are sometimes other
 connections between parties that are not monetary, such as personal 
capital, goodwill, or otherwise, that could be an underlying 
undercurrent swaying the decision to promote a particular offering. Due 
to this hypothetical possibility, you should again simply nor rely 
solely on what we have to say, but rather just form your own independent
 opinion just to be safe. Finally, bear in mind that we might also 
receive free products or services, gifts, or review copies of items 
too.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Testimonials
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Testimonials
 regarding the outcome or performance of using any product or service 
are provided to embellish your understanding of the offering. While 
great effort is made to ensure that they are factually honest, we at Matt Garrett Ltd. are not liable for errors and omissions. Aside from 
human error, some information may be provided by third parties, such as 
customers or product/service providers. The best results are not 
uncommonly correlated with the best efforts, discipline, diligence, and 
so on, and thus the results depicted cannot, in any way, be construed as
 common, typical, expected, normal, or associated with the average 
user’s experience with any given product or service. Exceptional results
 may be depicted by our website as highlights, but you are responsible 
for understanding that atypical outcomes may not reflect your 
experience. Aside from market conditions, products and services change 
over time. Older products may lose effectiveness. Newer products may not
 have a reliable track record.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Where
 products or services might pertain to earning money, the same 
safeguards about use of testimonials apply. Additionally, note that any 
related income figures are highly specific to the individual or entity 
that produced those results, and there can be no assurance that you will
 be able to leverage the same, or similar, products or services to 
achieve comparable results. The results, though real, may be the result 
of the conflation of a number of favorable circumstances that would be 
difficult to replicate, and so you must proceed with the knowledge that 
your outcome can differ from any shared on our website.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Professional Consultation &nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Many
 products and services are designed to solve problems. Common problem 
areas include legal, financial, and medical. We are in no way purporting
 to counsel you on issues related law, finances, or health. If you 
require guidance in these arenas, you should consider securing your own 
counsel from lawyers, accountants, tax professionals, investment 
advisors, or medical professionals before taking any action. Nothing we 
may ever communicate at Matt Garrett Ltd., in print or spoken word, 
will ever be intended to constitute any such counsel, as we do not claim
 to be professionals in any of those disciplines. You assume all risk 
for actions taken, losses incurred, damages sustained, or other issues 
stemming from your use of any product or service in any way connected 
with or mentioned on this website. Indeed, such decision is solely your 
own, or else determined in conjunction with the professional guidance of
 the advisor of your choosing.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Use Of Products &amp; Services
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The following are facts you should be advised of if you intend to take advantage of any products or services:&nbsp;</span></div><div>The
 price paid for products and services change over time. Even the prices 
of staples and basic commodities change, and there are many factors such
 as supply and demand, sales and other customer acquisition incentives, 
and more. Price, and value, can be quite relative. Technology, 
innovations, product improvements, market penetration, and numerous 
other factors all weigh in. It is impossible to define the “right” price
 for any product and service. Willing buyers and willing sellers 
determine price at any given time. You accept the fact that your 
purchase reflects your own attribution of value at the time of purchase,
 and that the price may increase or decrease in the future.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The
 outcome you experience is dependent upon many factors. Aptitude and 
attitude go a long way towards success with products and services in 
virtually any niche, whether fitness or making money. Circumstances, 
experience, innate abilities, personality, education, time commitments, 
and perseverance are just a few factors. Given the smorgasbord of 
interrelated variables, there is no way to reasonably predict your 
specific outcome with any degree of reliability or certainty.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><strong>Income-Producing Products &amp; Services &nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><strong></strong></div><div>Income-producing
 products &amp; services are likewise subject to the above cautions. In 
addition, however, there are additional factors we like to point out at 
Matt Garrett Ltd.. Unlike weight loss products or self-help materials, 
income-producing methods are influenced by the overall health of the 
economy in which one operates. In times of liquidity, money flows freely
 and commerce is easier. In times of perceived scarcity, fear, 
recession, depression, or otherwise, commerce is stymied. Results can be
 influenced by market sentiment, just as the stock market indices around
 the world are swayed heavily on news.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Income-producing products 
&amp; services purchased should be viewed as just that – purchases. 
Though they can be investments in one’s business, it is not unreasonable
 to expect that there may not be an express return on that investment, 
per se. Often, business success is the convergence of a number of 
factors, methods, strategies, and so on. It can be hard to peg success 
to one method or machination. This does not necessarily undermine value 
of any given product or service, as it can have an additive effect. Or, 
it may have no effect. Since it can be difficult to tell, you should 
operate on the assumption that your outcome could be zero. We make no 
guarantees and you should only risk what you can afford to lose on any 
purchases on or through Matt Garrett Ltd..
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Earning &amp; Income &nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In
 light of all of the factors above, impinging on the very nature of 
income-producing products and services, there is no way to guarantee 
results of any kind whatsoever. Accordingly, we affirmatively declare 
that we make no guarantees as to your earnings &amp; income of any kind,
 at any time.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>As 
with any business endeavor or investment, past performance is no 
guarantee or predictor of future performance. Any testimonials or other 
representations of results are for illustrative purposes only and, 
though every effort is made to ensure they’re factually honest, they are
 not intended to imply or insinuate what is likely to happen with you. 
Your reliance on them as such is not advised.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>It should be noted that “earnings &amp; income” is 
so phrased with specific intent. While income may typify the earnings 
most either seek or are accustomed to, earnings can come in non-monetary
 forms. These include some forms that are abstract or intangible, and 
thus not even readily converted to currency or a common medium of 
exchange. Thus, note that all manner of compensation, including earnings
 of a non-income yet nevertheless beneficial form, are covered by these 
provisions.
</div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Affiliates &amp; Other Third Parties
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><br></div><div>It should also be noted that we only 
have control over, and thus only accept responsibility for, the content 
of this Matt Garrett Ltd. website authored by us. Any representations 
made by others should be considered prima facie unauthorized. You may 
also read, hear, or otherwise come into contact with commentary about 
any of our products &amp; services or offerings, and should assume those
 have likewise not been authorized.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">While
 information, in any form, can arise, at any time, regarding our 
products &amp; services, there may be times when this results from an 
affiliate relationship. In other words, we may permit our products &amp;
 services to be marketed through other individuals, businesses, 
websites, and otherwise, just as providers of goods and services use 
retailers and other vendors to make available what they offer.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 should not construe a third-party offer as an endorsement by that third
 party of any product or service. You should, more conservatively, view 
it as an offer to buy something. Likewise, as alluded to previously, 
note that we cannot fully control all marketing practices by all 
parties. With the use of “mirror” sites, indirect or unauthorized 
affiliates, “tiered” affiliate structures, and so on, policing the world
 wide web with any modicum of thoroughness is unlikely. We make 
reasonable efforts to ensure our affiliates comply with our policies and
 represent our products &amp; services consistent with our guidelines. 
However, at Matt Garrett Ltd. we cannot always guarantee they will do 
so. You are always free to report concerns or abuses via our Contact 
information.</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Customer Care &nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Last, but not least, please note that
 our role in briefing you on products and services other than our own is
 simply as a "matchmaker." We do not provide any support or customer 
service for those items and you should always contact the owner or 
provider of those products or services to have any and all questions 
answered to your satisfaction before purchasing.

 site. The tool uses “cookies,” which are text files placed on your 
computer, to collect standard Internet log information and visitor 
behaviour information in an anonymous form. The information generated by
 the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) is
 transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate 
visitors’ use of this website and to compile statistical reports on 
website activity.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We
 will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical 
analytics tool to track or to collect any Personally Identifiable 
Information of visitors to our site. Google will not associate your IP 
address with any other data held by Google. Neither we nor Google will 
link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a computer 
user.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on 
your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be 
able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this 
website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in 
the manner and for the purposes set out above.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Other Collection of Personal Information&nbsp;</strong></span></div><div>
</div><div>When visiting our website, the IP address used to access our 
website may be logged along with the dates and times of access. This 
information is purely used to analyze trends, administer our website, 
track users movement, and gather broad demographic information for 
internal use such as statistical assessments and website improvement. 
Most importantly, any recorded IP addresses are not linked to personally
 identifiable information.
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Other
 information may be collected as well, which is rather typical of most 
websites. For instance, the source that referred you to our website is 
generally known. Likewise, your duration on our website, and your 
destination when you leave our website can also be tracked. Other common
 data collected includes the type of operating system the computer you 
are using to access our website has. Similarly, the type of web browser 
is often noted. Again, this is common data collection, and helps 
ultimately produce a better end-user experience.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Cookies
 are another common internet practice. Cookies are a key means of 
improving user experience by allows us to customize your use of our 
website. Simple information is transferred to your computer to allow the
 content and experience to reflect your actions, preferences, and so on.
 You should simply make the assumption our website uses cookies, and 
note that you are free to make adjustments in your web browser to 
disable these or otherwise receive notification of cookies so you can 
take whatever desired action you so choose. Please understand that 
refusing cookies may cripple some of our website features and render 
some aspects useless to you.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">At
 times, you will be fully aware of information received, as you are the 
direct source providing it. For instance, you may comment on a blog 
post, reply to an email (whether broadcast message or autoresponder), 
provide an email address, complete a survey, requests SMS, or otherwise.
 Likewise, purchases necessarily involve collecting certain information,
 such as credit card information, Paypal addresses, your physical 
address for billing and/or shipping, phone number, and so on. Refusing 
to provide some of this information may lead to us being unable to 
provide you with the products or services you’ve requested.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A
 prime example of limited access to our website is where content may be 
protected by a username and password. Whether a username and password is
 generated by our website, or created by you, these will almost always 
be connected with some other information related to or connected with 
you. This is true since much content that is protected on the internet 
is subscription based, often paid for. Thus, the username and password 
must necessarily be tied to your other account data. Usernames and 
passwords, by their very nature, should be kept private.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Website Cookies</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><br></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You

 may also process Aggregated Data from your personal data but this data 
does not reveal your identity and as such in itself is not personal 
data. An example of this is where we review your Usage Data to work out 
the percentage of website users using a specific feature of our site. If
 we link the Aggregated Data with your personal data so that you can be 
identified from it, then it is treated as personal data.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Sensitive Data
</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;

</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>How we use your personal data</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We will only use your personal data when legally permitted to do so. The most common uses of your personal data are:

 that any personal information you provide to others apart from us or 
our vendors is wholly optional. As an example, you might disclose 
something in a blog post comment. That “private” information is now 
“public,” and we have no control over that. In like fashion, you sharing
 information with any other third party not functioning as a service 
provider to us puts that information beyond our control and becomes 
subject to the policy that party has in place.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Our
 primary intention for collecting personal and private information from 
you is simply to conduct our business. We can use this internally to 
better serve you. Accordingly, we see no reason to share your personal 
information to other parties and outside interests unless you have 
authorized us to do so.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Of
 course, there are instances where your information is stored with third
 party service providers, such as email service providers, as they 
provide services that are industry-leading in quality and security and 
are far more beneficial to our end user than attempting such services 
“in-house.” However, you are never required to deal with any such third 
party directly, they are limited in how they use your information, and 
they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any way.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div>However,
 of course, your information does comprise part of an overall whole. 
This aggregate of information, by contrast, may be used to understand 
our overall user base. Further, we may share this information about our 
website visitors as a whole, not individually, with third parties for 
various purposes, in our sole discretion.
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">While
 we are staunch privacy advocates, there are times when even we may be 
forced to abandon these ideals. Just as major search engines face 
ongoing compulsion to provide data against their will, so too may the 
same occur with our website. Illegal activity or other serious acts or 
allegations could create legal liability for our website. In those 
cases, we reserve the right to share your information, or else may 
simply be compelled to do so by law.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">On
 the other hand, there may be times when we would need to share your 
private information in order to protect our own interests. For instance,
 in cases of suspected or alleged copyright infringement or other 
intellectual property violations, it may be necessary to share personal 
information.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Disclosures of your personal data.</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We may have to share 
your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set 
out in the section above titled "Lawful basis and purposes for 
processing personal data"</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•
 Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the 
United Kingdom and other relevant jurisdictions who require reporting of
 processing activities in certain circumstances.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We only permit such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You can ask us or third
 parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following
 the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you OR by emailing

</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Where you opt out of 
receiving our marketing communications, this will not apply to personal 
data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty 
registration, product/service experience or other transactions.

</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We will only use your 
personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we 
reasonably consider that we need to use it for another purpose and that 
purpose is compatible with the original purpose.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If we need to use your 
personal data for a purpose unrelated to the purpose for which we 
collected the data, we will notify you and we will explain the legal 
ground of processing.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><br></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Third party service providers outside of the European Economic Area.</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><br></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Many
 of our third parties service providers are based outside the European 
Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will 
involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Whenever we transfer 
your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar 
degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following 
safeguards is implemented:
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	We will only transfer
 your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an 
adequate level of protection for personal data by the European 
Commission; or
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Where we use certain 
service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or 
certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give 
personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Where we use 
providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if 
they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide
 similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the

any time.

</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We have in place 
appropriate security measures to protect your personal data and to 
prevent it from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an 
unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. Additionally, we limit access to
 your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other 
third parties who have a business need to know such data. They will only
 process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a
 duty of confidentiality.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We have put in place 
procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will 
notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally
 required to do so.

</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Retention of Data</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We only retain your 
personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we 
collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, 
accounting, or reporting requirements.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">To determine the 
appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, 
nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm
 from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes
 for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve 
those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal 
requirements.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We are legally required
 to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, 
Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease
 being customers for tax purposes.

</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We reserve the right to
 anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated 
with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use 
this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

 you know, Web 2.0 is all about the conversation. But without a few 
simple ground rules, that conversation can turn into a shouting match 
that discourages others from entering into the fray.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div>So here is Matt Garrett Ltd. comments policy. By posting on my blog, you agree to the following:
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 may comment without registering. You can log-in via Disqus, OpenID, 
Twitter, Facebook—or not at all. It’s up to you. You may post 
anonymously. I don’t recommend this, but you may do so if you wish. I 
may change this rule if it is abused.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 may post follow-up questions. If you have a question, chances are you 
are not alone. Others are likely thinking similarly. Therefore, I would 
rather receive your comments on Matt Garrett Ltd. than via email. It is
 a better use of my time to address everyone at once rather than answer 
several similar emails.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 may disagree with me. I welcome debate. However, I ask that if you 
disagree with me—or anyone else, for that matter—do so in a way that is 
respectful. In my opinion, there is way too much shouting in the public 
square to tolerate it here.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Matt Garrett Ltd. reserves the right to delete your comments. This is my 
blog. I don’t have an obligation to publish your comments. The First 
Amendment gives you the right to express your opinions on your blog not 
mine.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Specifically,
 I will delete your comments if you post something that is, in my sole 
opinion, (a)snarky; (b) off-topic; (c) libelous, defamatory, abusive, 
harassing, threatening, profane, pornographic, offensive, false, 
misleading, or which otherwise violates or encourages others to violate 
my sense of decorum and civility or any law, including intellectual 
property laws; or (d) “spam,” i.e., an attempt to advertise, solicit, or
 otherwise promote goods and services. You may, however, post a link to 
your site or your most recent blog post.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 retain ownership of your comments. I do not own them and I expressly 
disclaim any and all liability that may result from them. By commenting 
on my site, you agree that you retain all ownership rights in what you 
post here and that you will relieve me from any and all liability that 
may result from those postings.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 grant Matt Garrett Ltd. a license to post your comments. This license 
is worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, and royalty-free. You grant me
 the right to store, use, transmit, display, publish, reproduce, and 
distribute your comments in any format, including but not limited to a 
blog, in a book, a video, or presentation.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In
 short, my goal is to host interesting conversations with caring, 
honest, and respectful people. I believe this simple comments policy 
will facilitate this.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Your Legal Rights</strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><br></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Under
 certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in 
relation to your personal data. These include the right to:
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Request access to your personal data.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Request correction of your personal data.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Request erasure of your personal data.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Object to processing of your personal data.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Request restriction of processing your personal data.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Request transfer of your personal data.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">•	Right to withdraw consent.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">These rights are explained in detail here:</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/" target="_blank">https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/
</a></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please email us at email@mattgarrett.com.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You will not have to 
pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other 
rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is 
clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse
 to comply with your request in these circumstances.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We may need to request 
specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and 
ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of 
your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal 
data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We 
may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to 
your request to speed up our response.
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;
</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We try to respond to 
all legitimate requests within 30 days. On occasion it may take us 
longer if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number
 of requests.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><br></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><br></strong></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>CHANGE NOTICE:</strong>

<div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>The following describes the Social Media Disclosure for our Matt Garrett Ltd. website.
</strong><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Social Media Issue
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">We
 live in an interesting time when privacy rights are championed 
alongside an unprecedented voluntary willingness of people to share 
their most intimate and superfluous life details with the world, even in
 places such as our Matt Garrett Ltd. website. While apparently benign 
on the surface, the dangers of unrestrained public disclosure of 
sensitive information is beginning to surface.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Key
 social media players are being sued for unauthorized or abusive 
use/misuse of personal information. Failure to protect and warn are 
likely going to be focal factors. Lawsuits are filed seeking damages for
 statements held to be responsible for people's death or suicide. 
Bloggers presuming to operate under an unfettered freedom of speech or 
greater latitude offered to members of the press are losing civil cases 
for defamation, slander, libel, and so on.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">As
 social media rapidly advances to allow more technologically 
sophisticated and easy dissemination, the simultaneous fallout of 
revelation without boundaries is mounting. Thus, a sober approach to the
 benefits of social media, while sidestepping the perils of imprudent 
disclosure, can facilitate an enjoyable online experience, without the 
consequences of excess, in settings such as our own Matt Garrett Ltd. 
website.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><strong>Presence/Scope of Social Media&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 should assume that social media is in use on our Matt Garrett Ltd. 
website. A simple click of a button to endorse a person, product, or 
service is building a cumulative profile about you, which you should 
always assume can be discovered by others. Attempting to share a website
 with someone, whether by direct press of a button or else by email 
forwarding facilitated on a website, you should assume that this may not
 stop with the intended recipient, and that this can generate 
information about you that could be seen by a veritable infinite number 
of people. Such a domino effect could initiate right here on our Matt Garrett Ltd. website.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Something
 as simple as a blog comment provides the opportunity for knee-jerk 
reactions that can become public and may not truly represent a position 
(at least in strength or severity) that you might hold after a period of
 more reasoned contemplation. You should also note that the ease of 
accessing one site through the login credentials of another, or the use 
of a global login for access to multiple sites can accumulate a dossier 
on you and your online behavior that may reveal more information to 
unintended parties than you might realize or want. Any or all of these 
features could exist on our Matt Garrett Ltd. website at one time or 
another.
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">These
 few examples illustrate some possible ways that social media can exist,
 though it is not an exhaustive list and new technologies will render 
this list outdated quickly. The objective is to realize the reach of 
social media, its widespread presence on websites in various forms 
(including this website), and develop a responsible approach to using 
it.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><strong>Protecting Others&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 should recognize the fact that divulgences made in and on social media 
platforms on this website and others are rarely constrained just to you.
 Disclosures are commonly made about group matters that necessarily 
affect and impact other people. Other disclosures are expressly about 
third parties, sometimes with little discretion. What can appear funny 
in one moment can be tragic in the next. And a subtle "public" 
retaliation can have lifetime repercussions.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Ideal
 use of social media on our website would confine your disclosures 
primarily to matters pertaining to you, not others. If in doubt, it's 
best to err on the side of non-disclosure. It's doubtful the disclosure 
is so meaningful that it cannot be offset by the precaution of acting to
 protect the best interests of someone who is involuntarily being 
exposed by your decision to disclose something on our Matt Garrett Ltd.
 website (or another).
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Protecting Yourself&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 should likewise pause to consider the long-term effects of a 
split-second decision to publicly share private information about 
yourself on our Matt Garrett Ltd. website. Opinions, likes, dislikes, 
preferences, and otherwise can change. Openly divulging perspectives 
that you hold today, may conflict with your developing views into the 
futures. Yet, the "new you" will always stand juxtaposed against the 
prior declarations you made that are now concretized as part of your 
public profile. While the contents of your breakfast may hold little 
long-term impact, other data likewise readily shared can have 
consequences that could conceivably impact your ability to obtain 
certain employment or hinder other life experiences and ambitions.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">As
 with sharing information about other people, extreme caution should be 
used before revealing information about yourself. If in doubt, it's 
likely best not to do it. The short term gain, if any, could readily be 
outweighed by later consequences. Finally, you should note that we are 
not responsible for removing content once shared, and we may not be able
 to do so.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><strong>Restrictions on Use of Social Media Data&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You,
 as a visitor to our Matt Garrett Ltd. website, are not permitted to 
"mine" social media or other platforms contained herein for personal 
information related to others. Even where people have publicly displayed
 data, you should not construe that as though you have the liberty to 
capture, reproduce, or reuse that information. Any use of social media 
or related platforms on our website are for interactive use only, 
relevant only during the website visit.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Accuracy of Social Media Data
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>As any social media 
platform is built on user-generated content, you should consider this 
fact in seeking to determine the authenticity of anything you read. We 
are not responsible for verifying any user-generated content for 
accuracy. A best practices policy would be to view all such content as 
strictly opinion, not fact.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Potential Issues of Liability
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>You should also be 
mindful of the fact that your words could trigger liability for harm 
caused to others. While you have the right to free speech, you do not 
have the right to damage other people. Under basic principles of tort 
law, you are always responsible, personally, for situations where 
either:</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>1. you were required to act, but did not (i.e. - some "duty of care")
</div><div><br></div><div>2. your were required to refrain from acting, but did not (i.e. - slander, defamation, etc.)
</div><div>
</div><div>These "sins of omission and commission" could cause problems 
for you, irrespective of whether you assert you are conducting business 
under the guise of one or more business entities. Illegal and unethical 
conduct, when done in the name of a corporation or LLC, is still illegal
 and unethical conduct. As it is rarely part of a business plan to 
engage in illegal and unethical conduct, you are doubtfully operating in
 any official capacity, but rather, perhaps, leveraging that capacity to
 effectuate personal wrongdoing. You should consult a licensed attorney 
if you wish legal advice as to the (potential) ramification of your 
situation or legal problems stemming from this website or another.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>CHANGE NOTICE: </strong>As
 with any of our administrative and legal notice pages, the contents of 
this page can and will change over time. Accordingly, this page could

</div><div><strong><br></strong><strong>Social Media Warning (Divulgence of Personal &amp; Private Information)&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Social
 media has provided a platform for internet users to disclose much 
personal information about themselves, in a way that seems innocuous, if
 not proper and expected. However, more than a few folks have already 
lived to regret personal information that was shared either by them or 
others. This has long been true of simple email. It is exponentially 
true of social websites and applications for social media on any other 
website, including this one. You are cautioned against carelessly 
disclosing information.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>3. Indemnification.
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless our
 Matt Garrett Ltd. website, its members, officers, directors, 
employees, agents, licensors, suppliers and any third party information 
providers to our website from and against all losses, expenses, damages 
and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any use 
of our website or violation of this Agreement (including negligent or 
wrongful conduct) by you or any other person accessing our website.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>4. Third Party Rights.
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The
 provisions of paragraphs 2 (Use of the Service), and 3 
(Indemnification) are for the benefit of our website and its owners, 
officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers, and any 
third party information providers to the Service. Each of these 
individuals or entities shall have the right to assert and enforce those
 provisions directly against you on its/their own behalf.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>5.Term; Termination.
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>We reserve the right to investigate complaints or 
reported violations of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use and 
to take any action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to 
reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, 
regulators, or other third parties and disclosing any data necessary or 
appropriate to such persons or entities relating to your profile, email 
addresses, usage history, IP addresses and traffic data.
</div><div><br></div><div>This Agreement, in whole or in part, may be 
terminated by Matt Garrett Ltd. without notice at any time for any 
reason. The provisions of paragraphs 1 (Copyright, Licenses and Idea 
Submissions), 2 (Use of the Service), 3 (Indemnification), 4 (Third 
Party Rights), 6 (Hiring an Attorney / No Attorney-Client Relationship),
 and 7 (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, 
in whole or in part.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>6. Hiring an 
Investment Advisor, Attorney, or Medical or Other Professional / No 
Attorney-Client Relationship or Fiduciary Capacity. &nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Choosing
 a lawyer, doctor, or investment advisor is a serious matter and should 
NOT be based solely on data contained on our website or in 
advertisements.&nbsp;</span></div><div>The law is constantly changing 
and the data may not be complete or accurate depending on your 
particular legal issue. Each legal issue depends on its individual facts
 and different jurisdictions have different laws and regulations. This 
is why you should seriously consider hiring licensed, professional 
counsel in your jurisdiction.
</div><div>
</div><div>Medical issues are complex, and can often stem from both 
organic and psychological factors. Never should a website be used as a 
source of diagnosing or treating medical problems.
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Financial
 matters are highly individualistic. Risk tolerance is just one factor 
to consider before making any investments or financial decisions. For 
these, and other, reasons, you should look to the guidance of a trained 
professional, not a website.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">You
 may send us email, but in no instance will this communication in any 
way be construed as initiating an attorney-client relationship, or other
 professional relationship, and so the contact should not include 
confidential or sensitive data because your communication will not be 
treated as privileged or confidential.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>7.Miscellaneous.
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><strong></strong></div><div><strong>Disputes</strong><br></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Any
 cause of action by you with respect to our Matt Garrett Ltd. website 
must be instituted within one (1) year after the cause of action arose 
or be forever waived and barred. All actions shall be subject to the 
limitations set forth in these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use. 
Any legal claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service and
 Conditions of Use or our website, excluding intellectual property right
 infringement and other claims by us, shall be settled confidentially 
through mandatory binding arbitration per the American Arbitration 
Association commercial arbitration rules. The arbitration shall be 
conducted in California. Each party shall bear one half of the 
arbitration fees and costs incurred, and each party shall bear its own 
lawyer fees. All claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and 
shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or 
controversy of any other party.&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Modification
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>Neither the course of conduct between the parties 
nor industry trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this 
Agreement.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Assignability
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Our website may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Contra Preferentum
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><strong></strong></div><div>The
 language in these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall be 
interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any 
party. Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be
 resolved against the drafting party (i.e. – “contra preferentum”) shall
 not apply in interpreting these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use,
 as the Agreement shall be construed as having been co-authored by the 
parties.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Severability
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Should
 any part of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use be held 
invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed as much as 
possible consistent with applicable law and severability shall apply to 
the remaining portions, so that they remain in full force and 
effect.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span><strong>This Agreement Prevails&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">To
 the extent that anything in or associated with our website is in 
conflict or inconsistent with these Terms of Service and Conditions of 
Use, these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall take 
precedence.&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Waiver
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Our
 failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Service and 
Conditions of Use shall not be deemed a waiver of the provision nor of 
the right to enforce the provision.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div>Our rights under these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall survive any termination of this agreement.
