## What about cookies?

This web site may use cookies to keep track of your choices, or to keep track of the fact that you have signed in so you don't have to continually enter your username and password. Also, we use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and for other purposes. (Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to track movements within web sites.) Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However some areas will not function properly if you do so. There are many sources for additional information about Internet cookies, and we encourage anyone concerned about the use of cookies to do more research on the topic so you can make an informed decision about accepting them from any site.

## What about web beacons?

In addition to cookies, Nintendo uses a common Internet technology called "Web beacons" (a.k.a. "Web bugs," "action tags," "pixel trackers," or "clear GIFs") on some of its sites. Web beacons are small graphic images placed on a Web page, Web-based document, or in an e-mail message that are designed to allow us or a third party to collect certain information and monitor user activity on our sites. Web beacons are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document or e-mail message. We do not use Web beacons to collect or to link to personal information. We may use Web beacons to collect non-personal information such as the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web user comes from, and the time the Web beacon is activated (such as when you view the Web page, advertisement, or e-mail that contains the Web beacon). We may also use Web beacons to display e-mails in the appropriate HTML or text format. From time to time, we may permit third parties to place Web beacons on our sites or in e-mails sent on our behalf for purposes of collecting the same types of information specified above, but these Web beacons do not collect and are not linked to personal information either.

## E-mail correspondence to Nintendo

Nintendo will respond to e-mail correspondence if such correspondence includes a return e-mail address. Because an e-mail address is personal identifying information, Nintendo protects the privacy of the sender by limiting access to these e-mail messages and keeping them in a secure e-mail system. Most e-mail messages are deleted after they are responded to, however in certain cases hard copies or data from certain e-mail correspondence may be kept on file. Any such copies will also be stored in a secure location, and information from these messages will not be used for marketing purposes. In the event that Nintendo becomes legally obligated to disclose information obtained from consumers on its web site to another pursuant to legal or administrative process, Nintendo will take all reasonable steps to redact personal information from the data where possible.

## Removal from Nintendo's e-mail list

If you do not want Nintendo to send you e-mail you can unsubscribe via selecting the unsubscribe option when you receive an email from Nintendo or by unsubscribing via the unsubscribe option in the registration section. If you have opted-in and at a later date you choose to have your name removed from our e-mail database, you can do so from the Members section.

Nintendo reserves the right to unsubscribe details when an email address supplied is invalid.
