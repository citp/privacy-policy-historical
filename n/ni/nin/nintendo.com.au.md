## What information is collected?

Nintendo will only collect Personal Information from our online visitors to the website for (1) contest registration; (2) newsletter registration; (3) surveys; (4) registration for games or special game-specific promotion participation; (5) and to enable you to join specific groups such as My Nintendo. Personal Information will only be collected with your consent. Personal Information collected may include your name, nickname, e-mail address, mobile phone number and birth date. We do not generally require this information to allow access to this website; however, there may be some areas of the site that you will not be able to access unless you register. For example, "Members Only" areas will require you to register before you can access them.

Nintendo also may collect demographic information from visitors, such as age, gender, geographic location, game genre interests, what platforms you own and stores you usually purchase Nintendo products from. This information helps us improve our online offerings and allows us to tailor information to your preferences.

Normally, Nintendo does not collect Sensitive Information (as defined in the Act). If Nintendo does collect Sensitive Information, it will only do so with consent, and as specifically permitted by APP 3.3.

## What happens to the Personal Information collected?

The Personal Information you provide will allow us to alert you to new products, features and enhancements, special offers, upgrade opportunities, and contests and events of interest. From time to time, Nintendo is approached by companies and organisations that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and we may send out notices on behalf of these companies. We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. You may opt out if you do not wish to receive such material.

We may use your Personal Information for internal demographic studies, so we can improve our websites and products to better meet our visitors' needs. In some cases, we may merge your Personal Information with data collected from other sources.

Nintendo occasionally uses outside agencies for market research, and may provide these companies with your Personal Information. These companies will be required to comply with Nintendo's privacy practices, the Act and the APPs in handling this information.

Nintendo may also disclose Personal Information to government, law enforcement and regulatory bodies where this is necessary for Nintendo to comply with its legal obligations. We will notify you where we are required to make such disclosures. Nintendo may also disclose Personal Information to other organisations with which Nintendo has a business relationship (including other companies within the Nintendo Group provided that such organisations have agreed to treat the Personal Information in accordance with the Act and the APPs).

Nintendo may disclose personal information to overseas recipients including Nintendo Co. Ltd (Nintendo’s parent company located in Japan), Nintendo of America Inc. (an affiliated company located in the United States) and Nintendo of Europe GmbH (an affiliated company located in Germany).
