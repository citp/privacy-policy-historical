  * at the 'Contact Us' section of the website, which enables you to use the online form to submit an enquiry and any specific question to Ninefold. In order to process your enquiry, we request that you complete the online form by providing certain personal information, such as contact details. If you send an email, we require the same information;

Before you gain access to these services, we collect some personal information; such as the names of individuals, their contact number, credit card details and position, who are authorised by their organisation to use the access user identification and password and the online facilities associated with these services. Our server tracks the user identification and passwords that are used. In turn, this usage provides information about an individual's use of the online services.



#### What do we do with the information?

Once collected, the personal information is stored in our databases. Some information relating to billing or other contract management is handled through our Software as a Service (SAAS) partners and may be stored and processed offshore. However, if you choose to purchase cloud virtual servers and storage services from us, all of your cloud data is hosted in Australian data centres.

Your personal information may be used to:

  * handle orders
  * verify your identity;
  * assist you in the provision of our services;
  * administer and manage those services, including charging, billing and collecting debts;
  * conduct appropriate checks for credit-worthiness; and
  * deliver targeted and non-targeted marketing information to you about our services. When we first contact you for the purpose of direct marketing however, we will give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving any further marketing communications from us. You can also contact us as outlined below, to request that we do not send you any further information;



If we wish to use any of your personal information for purposes other than those listed above, we will only do so with your prior consent.

#### Do we disclose your personal information to others?

Ninefold understands that any personally identifiable information that it collects from you is strictly confidential. We do not share, sell, rent or otherwise disclose your personal information except in the following circumstances if applicable:

  * contractors / providers: In order to provide the services to our customers, we may exchange information with contractors, suppliers, carriers or carriage service providers;
  * to conduct credit checks; and
  * where we are required by/or allowed by law, regulation or industry codes, for safety reasons or where we reasonably believe that you are in breach of the terms of use of our website or are engaging in unlawful activities.



#### How do we protect your personal information?

We take all reasonable steps to maintain the security of your personal information that we collect. We use a variety of secure techniques to protect your information from unauthorised access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. For information that is stored on electronic databases, we use secure servers, firewalls, and restrict access by only allowing those personnel that 'need to know' the information, access to that information using passwords. Credit card information is stored on a PCI compliant billing system. For information that is not stored electronically, Ninefold ensures that our employees and contractors understand that personal information is only to be reproduced strictly where necessary and always stored and treated confidentially.

Online or electronic data transmission (whether information you transmit to Ninefold or that we transmit to you using your personal information) is not 100% secure. Therefore, any online activity by you in connection with the website is conducted at your own risk, despite our best endeavours to ensure the security of the information that is transmitted between us.
