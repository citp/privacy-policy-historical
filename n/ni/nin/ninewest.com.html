			<div class="contHeader"><a name="info" id="info"></a>What information does Nine West collect?</div>
			<div class="textBlock">
			  Nine West collects data that you provide to our sales associates in our company-owned Nine West stores and outlets and the stores and
			  outlets of our affiliated brands (including Nine West, Bandolino, Kasper, Anne Klein, and Jones New York); on ninewest.com and the websites
			  of our affiliated brands through transactions, email registration, sweepstakes, contests, or online membership; or through phone, mail and
			  fax interactions or paper registrations that you submit.
			  <br><br>
			  Nine West may collect and store two types of information: "personal information" and "automatic information."
			  <br><br>
			  Personal information tells us who you are such as your name, gender, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number,
			  date of birth or age, any personal preferences you choose to provide, transaction details such as style, size, price, discount, date, store,
			  your credit card number and expiration date used for transactions, and an assigned password to protect your privacy.
			  <br><br>
			  Automatic information is information that we collect automatically whenever you interact with this website such as your IP address, the type
			  of computer you use, and the web browser you use. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. Each
			  time you visit this site, our web server may automatically recognize and collect this information.
			  <br><br>
			  Automatic information also includes "cookies" and "web beacons". A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web
			  server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Among other things, cookies provide a means for us to keep track of your online patterns and
			  preferences. By understanding which areas of the site you visit, cookies allow us to present information, products and services that are of
			  personal interest. A cookie will not allow us to learn any personal information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise
			  disclosed. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can change your browser so that it will not automatically accept cookies.
			  However, if you do so, it is possible that some portions of the site may not function as intended. "Web beacons", also known as clear GIFs or
			  single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that we may place on web pages and within web-based email newsletters that we send. Working in
			  conjunction with cookies, web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific page and the number
			  of times those pages are displayed. We can also use web beacons to let us know how many people opened a web-based email newsletter.
			  <br><br>
			  We may associate automatic information with your personal information. In the event of such association, such automatic information will be considered personal information.
			  <br><br>
			  Finally, Nine West occasionally obtains email addresses of active Nine West store customers who requested fashion emails on other websites.
			  Nine West also reserves the right to obtain publicly accessible customer demographics.
			</div>
			<div class="contHeader"><a name="use" id="use"></a>How does Nine West use this information?</div>
			<div class="textBlock">
			  Nine West uses this information to confirm and process sales transactions or to contact you with questions or communications about your order,
			  or to respond to your customer service inquiries.
			  <br><br>
			  Nine West also uses this information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience, both online and in our stores, to communicate with
			  you for marketing and promotional purposes via targeted postal pieces, phone messages, or personalized emails, and to improve the effectiveness
			  of our websites and business activities. You may indicate your contact preferences regarding promotional communications either directly to us
			  online or to customer service representatives.
			</div>
			<div class="contHeader"><a name="access" id="access"></a>How can you access your information?</div>
			<div class="textBlock">
			  You may access and edit the information that you provide online by signing in at ninewest.com. Simply click on the "<a href="http://www.ninewest.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-ninewest-Site/default/Login-Show">Sign in or sign up</a>" link
			  from the home page and enter your email address and password to access your information. You can request password help at any time by clicking
			  on the "<a href="http://www.ninewest.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-ninewest-Site/default/Login-Show">I don't have/know my password</a>" link, at which time ninewest.com will email a password to the associated email address. Currently, we
			  do not provide online access to information that you provided to Nine West offline. But at any time you may request access to your information
			  from our customer service representatives.
			</div>
			<div class="contHeader"><a name="protect" id="protect"></a>How does Nine West protect your information?</div>
			<div class="textBlock">
			  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be unconditionally guaranteed to be secure. Therefore any information you transmit to us is sent at your own risk.
			  <br><br>
			  However, when you place an order online, we use encryption technology, such as Secure Socket Layer Technology ("SSL"), to protect your personal information
			  during data transport. SSL encrypts your order information, including your name, address, and credit card number, before it is transmitted to us to avoid
			  the decoding of your information by anyone other than Nine West.
			  <br><br>
			  In addition, when you create an online account on ninewest.com, you must select a personal password. As a member of Nine West's website, you will be able to view,
			  among other things, your account profile, contact preferences, order history, and address book. We store this type of information so that you do not have to reenter it
			  each time you make a purchase or visit the website. Should you decide to become a member of Nine West's website, you will be asked to provide an accurate email address
			and create a password. In order to help protect your personal information, you should be careful about maintaining the secrecy of your password.			</div>
			<div class="contHeader"><a name="disclose" id="disclose"></a>Does Nine West disclose your information to others?</div>
		  <div class="textBlock">
			 Jones Apparel Group, Inc. is the parent company for Nine West. <a href="http://www.jonesapparel.com/" target="_blank">Jones Apparel Group</a> maintains a single database of customer information for several brands owned by the
			 Jones Apparel Group family of companies, including <a href="http://www.ninewest.com/" target="_blank">Nine West</a>, <a href="http://www.easyspirit.com/" target="_blank">Easy Spirit</a>, <a href="http://www.bandolino.com/" target="_blank">Bandolino</a>, <a href="http://www.kasper.com/" target="_blank">Kasper</a>, <a href="http://www.anneklein.com/" target="_blank">Anne Klein</a>
			 and <a href="http://www.jny.com/" target="_blank">Jones New York</a> brands. For each customer in this database, Jones Apparel Group maintains a separate set of contact preferences for each brand to which that customer
			 has provided her customer information. When you establish or update your customer profile information with one of the Jones Apparel Group brands, whether through a purchase, registration
			 or email sign-up at a company-owned or operated website, specialty store or outlet store for one of the Jones Apparel Group brands, through a customer service representative, or in any other communication
			 you may have with us, we will update your customer record on the Jones Apparel Group database. We may disclose personal information to our affiliates (including, without
			 limitation, our parent, Jones Apparel Group) that either are subject to this privacy policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this privacy policy.
			 <br><br>
			 Except as described in this privacy policy, Nine West does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any personal information you provide to us online or at our stores, nor do we
			 share such information with third parties. We may disclose personal information about you to third parties who provide services to us and who agree to maintain the confidentiality
			 of such information in accordance with this privacy policy and use the information only in connection with the services they provide. These third parties may provide a variety
			 of services to us including, without limitation, assisting us in fulfilling your transactions and customer service inquiries, updating your customer information record in our
			 database, deploying our promotional offers to you, or fulfilling your request to <a href="http://www.ninewest.com/UNSUBSCRIBE/UNSUB_PRIVACY,default,pg.html">unsubscribe</a> from our email. We do not authorize those third parties to make any
			 other use of your information.
			 <br><br>
			 We may use and/or disclose to others information about your demographics and use of our website in a manner that does not reveal your identity.
			 <br><br>
			 We may disclose personal information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring
			 legal action against someone who may have breached our <a href="http://www.ninewest.com/Terms/TERMS,default,pg.html">Conditions of Use</a> or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally
			 or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users of our website, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.
			 <br><br>
			 We may also disclose personal information when we reasonably believe that the law requires it. We might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions,
			 personally identifiable information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy. Also,
			 in the unlikely event that assets of Nine West are sold, personal information may be one of the transferred assets.
			 <br><br>
			 Nine West honors every request to <a href="http://www.ninewest.com/UNSUBSCRIBE/UNSUB_PRIVACY,default,pg.html">unsubscribe</a> from receipt of emails within ten (10) days of receiving the request, not only for promotional emails
			 that Nine West sends, but also for emails about Nine West that we permit other companies to send to their own list of subscribers.
