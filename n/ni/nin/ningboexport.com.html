  <p align="center" class="STYLE1">PRIVACY POLICY (Updated on June 8, 2000) </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">This is the Privacy Policy governing your use of the NingboExport Site. By   using this Site, you consent to our Privacy Policy set out below. All terms not   defined in this document have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use   Agreement between you and NingboExport which by use of this Site you agree to   accept. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">1. The Information We Collect </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">1.1 Registration Information. At the time you register to become a Registered   User of the Site, you will be asked to fill out a registration form which   requires you provide information such as your name, address, phone/fax number,   email address and other personal information as well as information about your   business ("Registration Information"). </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">1.2 Publishing Information. If you submit any information to NingboExport to   be published on the Site through the publishing tools, including but not limited   to Company Profile, Product Catalog, Trade Leads, TrustPass Profile and any   discussion forum, then you are deemed to have given consent to the publication   of such information ("Publishing Information"). </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">1.3 Statistical Information. In addition, we gather aggregate statistical   information about our Site and Users, such as IP addresses, browser software,   operating system, pages viewed, number of sessions and unique visitors, etc.   ("Statistical Information"). </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">1.4 Registration Information, Publishing Information, Statistical Information   and any information we may collect from you through the use of cookies (see   Section 5 below) or any other means shall collectively be referred to as   "Collected Information". </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">2. How We May Use Information </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">2.1 General. We use your Collected Information to improve our marketing and   promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content   and product offerings and to customize our Site's content, layout and service   specifically for you. We may use your Collected Information to service your   Account with us, including but not limited to investigating problems, resolving   disputes and enforcing agreements with us. We do not sell, rent, trade or   exchange any personally-identifying information of our Users. We may share   certain aggregate information based on analysis of Collected Information with   our partners, customers, advertisers or potential Users. We may use your   Collected Information to execute marketing campaigns, promotions or advertising   messages on behalf of third parties; however, in these circumstances, your   Collected Information will not be disclosed to such third parties unless you   respond to the marketing, promotion or advertising message. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">2.2 Registration Information. We may use your Registration Information to   provide services that you request or to contact you regarding additional   services about which NingboExport determines that you might be interested.   Specifically, we may use your email address, mailing address, phone number or   fax number to contact you regarding notices, surveys, product alerts, new   service or product offerings and communications relevant to your use of our   Site. We may generate reports and analysis based on the Registration Information   for internal analysis, monitoring and marketing decisions. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">2.3 Publishing Information. All of your Publishing Information will be   publicly available on the Site and therefore accessible by any internet user.   Any Publishing Information that you disclose to NingboExport becomes public   information and you relinquish any proprietary rights (including but not limited   to the rights of confidentiality and copyrights) in such information. You should   exercise caution when deciding to include personal or proprietary information in   the Publishing Information that you submit to us. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">2.4 Statistical Information. We use Statistical Information to help diagnose   problems with and maintain our computer servers, to manage our Site, and to   enhance our Site and services based on the usage pattern data we receive. We may   generate reports and analysis based on the Statistical Information for internal   analysis, monitoring and marketing decisions. We may provide Statistical   Information to third parties, but when we do so, we do not provide   personally-identifying information without your permission. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">3. Disclosure of Information </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">3.1 We reserve the right to disclose your Collected Information to relevant   authorities where we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to   identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be infringing or   threatening to infringe, or who may otherwise be causing injury to or   interference with, the title, rights, interests or property of NingboExport, our   Users, customers, partners, other web site users or anyone else who could be   harmed by such activities. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">3.2 We also reserve the right to disclose Collected Information in response   to a subpoena or other judicial order or when we reasonably believe that such   disclosure is required by law, regulation or administrative order of any court,   governmental or regulatory authority. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">3.3 If we have reason to believe that a User is in breach of the Terms of   User Agreement or any other agreement with us, then we reserve the right to make   public or otherwise disclose such User's Collected Information in order to   pursue our claim or prevent further injury to NingboExport or others. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">4. Co-Branded Relationships </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">We have established relationships with other parties to offer you the benefit   of other products and services which we ourselves do not offer. We offer you   access to these other parties either through the use of hyperlinks to their   sites from our Site, or through offering "co-branded" sites in which both   ourselves and these other parties share the same uniform resource locator,   domain name or pages within a domain name on the Internet. In some cases you may   be required to submit information for purposes of registering or applying for   products or services provided by such third parties or co-branded partners. The   privacy policy of such other parties may differ from ours, and we may not have   any control over the information that you submit to such third parties or   co-branded sites. We therefore encourage you to read that policy before   responding to any offers, products or services provided by such other parties. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">5. Cookies </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">5.1 We use "cookies" to store specific information about you and track your   visits to our Site. It is not uncommon for web sites to use cookies to enhance   identification of their users. A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent   to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can be sent   to your computer's hard drive only if you access our Site using the computer. If   you do not de-activate or erase the cookie, each time you use the same computer   to access our Site, our web servers will be notified of your visit to our Site   and in turn we may have knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage.   Generally, we use cookies to identify you and enable us to access your   Registration Information, Publishing Information or Payment Information so you   do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by Users;   research visiting patters and help target advertisements based on User   interests; assist our partners to track User visits to the Site and process   orders; and track progress and participation in promotions. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">5.2 You can determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring   your browser's which is installed in the computer you are using to access the   Site. If you desire, you can change those configurations in your browser. By   setting your preferences in the browser, you can accept all cookies, you can be   notified when a cookie is sent, or you can reject all cookies. If you reject all   cookies by choosing the cookie-disabling function in your browser, you may be   required to re-enter your information on our Site more often and certain   features of our Site may be unavailable. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">6. Minors </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">The Site and its contents are not intended to be targeted to minors under   applicable law and we do not intend to sell any of our products or services to   minors. However, we have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who   access our Site and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of   all ages. If a minor has provided us with personal information without parental   or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the   information. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">7. Security Measures </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">7.1 We employ commercially reasonable security methods to prevent   unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of   information. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">7.2 As a Registered User, your Registration Information, Publishing   Information and Payment Information (if any) can be viewed and edited through   your Account which is protected by Password. We recommend that you do not   divulge your Password to anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your   Password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. If you share   a computer with others, you should not choose to save your log-in information   (e.g., User ID and Password) on the computer. Remember to sign out of your   Account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">7.3 No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be   guaranteed to be perfectly secured. As a result, while we try to protect your   information, no web site or company, including ourselves, can absolutely ensure   or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at   your own risk. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">8. Changes to Privacy Policy </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated through our posting   an amended and restated Privacy Policy on our Site. Our posting the amended and   restated Privacy Policy will make such new Privacy Policy immediately effective.   You agree that all Collected Information (whether or not collected prior to or   after the new policy became effective) will be governed by the newest Privacy   Policy then in effect. If you do not agree to the new changes in our Privacy   Policy, you should contact NingboExport in writing (at the address set out in   the Notice provision of the Terms of Use Agreement) and specifically request   that NingboExport return and/or destroy all copies of all or part of your   Collected Information in NingboExport's possession. This Privacy Policy was last   amended on April 10, 2003. </p>
  <p class="STYLE1">9. Correcting Your Information </p>
