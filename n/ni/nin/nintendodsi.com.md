We use the information that you give us and the information we collect to deliver, maintain and improve our services. We also use this information to provide you with services that you request, develop new services, suggest personally relevant features, offer you customized content, provide you with tailored advertising, protect Nintendo and our users, and investigate and prevent activities that are potentially illegal or that violate our user agreements or terms of use.

Whenever you contact us, we use the information that you provide to us to help resolve issues you might be having when you use our services. We also use information, such as your email address, to respond to you when you contact us, to let you know about changes to our policies and terms, to let you know about changes or improvements to our services and to inform you about other services that we offer.

We may use cookies, or other similar technologies, on some of the features of our services. Cookies are small files that are typically downloaded to the browser application on your device. Cookies help us to ensure the safety and smooth functioning of certain features of our services and they also help us to collect information about your user preferences. We sometimes use information collected from cookies to improve your user experience and the quality of our services. For example, by saving your user preferences, we may be able to customize our services in ways that you prefer. You may be able to disable cookies in your browser settings or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being used. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of our services. Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals.

Analytics providers are third-party companies that collect information when you use some of our services. These companies use cookies, web beacons, software development kits (SDKs), and similar technologies to collect and analyze crash reports, keep track of what content or ads you view, how long you spend on different pages, how you arrived on a particular page and how you respond to the ads we show you. Analytics providers may combine the information they collect from our services with other information they collect from other sites and services.  The practices of these third-party analytics providers are governed by their own privacy policies.

We also may permit our third-party partners to set cookies and use web beacons, SDKs, and similar technologies within our services to help us perform various internal functions necessary to operate our business and to collect information about your use of our and others’ services across your devices. These third parties may use that information to provide you advertisements, across the Internet and mobile applications and devices, about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Some of these third parties may offer you a way to opt-out of this type of targeted advertising through industry choice mechanisms.

* ### How your information is shared

We sometimes share your information within our family of Nintendo companies and with trusted third-party partners outside of Nintendo for processing. We may also share your information for other legal and business purposes, such as complying with legal process, responding to claims or inquiries, enforcing our terms, or protecting the rights, property or personal safety of our operations, our users, or the public. Your information may also be shared as part of any sale or transfer of company assets, if legally permitted.

If you choose to connect with a third-party service through our services, we may share your information with that service and that service may share your information with us. The use of your information, and the use of cookies, web beacons, or other technologies, by these third-party providers is subject to their own privacy policies.

Some of our services allow you to share information and content with others. When you decide to use these services, the information or content that you share, your online status, and your gameplay information may be visible to Nintendo and its trusted business partners, other Nintendo users, and in some cases the public. Please keep in mind, when you use these service, that the information and content that you choose to share can be read, collected, or used by others.

We have implemented administrative, physical and technical security measures that are designed to protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. You should understand though that, despite our efforts, no security can be guaranteed as impenetrable.

* ### Information about children

We do not knowingly collect, use or share personal information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent or as permitted by law. Where a parent or legal guardian has provided consent, the child may be able to use his or her Nintendo Account to play certain third-party games and applications that are not published by Nintendo. Parents or guardians may review, modify, or delete the child’s personal information, or withdraw consent, by contacting us using the contact information provided at the end of this privacy policy, and may manage which third-party games and applications can access and use the child’s Nintendo Account information through parental controls.
