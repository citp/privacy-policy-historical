# Terms of Use, Privacy Policy & GDPR Compliance statement - Nintendo Enthusiast

**House rules: Please be nice**

Basically, don’t do anything you wouldn’t do in real life. People come to our sites to kick back, not debate the failings of humanity, politics, religion, and everything else that the average person would not define as their “hobby”.  This is a place to relax and celebrate our video game hobby.  Naturally, when there are passionate fans some arguments arise and passions can run deep. You’re not expected to agree with everything or everyone all the time, but there’s never a reason to make a discussion on this site  _personal_.  There’s also no need to be vulgar. If you’re a dick you’ll be banned swiftly and without notice, so be cool, yeah?  _“Ain’t nobody here got time for no jibba-jabba and foolishness”._

 **Your privacy is important**

We run a trusted community site, so we hold ourselves to the highest privacy standards. Simply put — We would never sell your email address, nor share it with with anyone, or ever spam you — ever, end of story. We also have everything in place to keep the bad guys out. We would also never ask you for your passwords, credit card, phone, etc.

 _In fact,   **don’t use your real name on our site** , so you don’t have to worry too much about your privacy. You can edit your customer info and profile at any time._

By becoming a member of our web site community, you are only agreeing to become a virtual person in our world . Seriously, that’s all there is to it. Easy, eh? Yes, as it should be. (ahem!) We allow the use of [burner email addresses](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=burner+email&oq=burner+email&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1821j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) too, but note that you won’t be able to recover your password if you forget it.

 **[GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/) Compliance**

Our site uses a basic PHP login script that stores your customer number and username and login state … that’s it.  We make no attempt to figure out who you are in real life nor do we care. Even our login page asks you to create a fake persona here because sometimes people say dumb things when gaming on the internet. Setup a fake avatar on our site and forget about it, done, easy.  Furthemore, you can block/delete all cookies from our site that you won’t find anything different about our site, as we don’t have creepy feeds or target you in any way.

We do serve ads using Google Ad server, which issues its own cookies.  For these ad-related cookies, you’ll be able to use Google’s own tools to access the data of that cookies.  These tools are to be released after May 15, 2018.  For more info, [check this resource](https://adexchanger.com/privacy/this-is-how-google-is-preparing-for-gdpr/).

 **Financial Information:**

We don’t host any financial information on our servers, period. We use third-party commerce partners for memberships and merchandise sales. If you need a refund or have privacy concerns about something you bought in conjunction with us, please contact them directly or ask our moderators to help point you in that direction.

 **The Long Version:**

Our site is part of the Enthusiast Gaming network, and we’re very committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. The following statement details our ongoing support for the responsible collection and management of Internet user information. We also follow all rules set forth by the Online Privacy Alliance.

 **Internet User Information**

When we display an advertisement on your computer, we do not collect any personal identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number or email address. Destructoid.com  does, like other Internet advertisers, collect certain information which can not personally identify you. (Specifically: Cookies!)

This category of information is generally referred to as non-personally-identifiable information includes information like the server or internet service provider you use, type of browser used. There are some cases where you, the Internet user, may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a particular ad (a survey or purchase order form). In such cases the third party advertising with our site may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. The advertiser in turn uses this information to reply to your request.

Furthermore, Enthusiast Gaming  does not divulge any information regarding the users who use email for correspondence with the webmaster or any representative of our company.

 **Online Advertising**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect information when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on our Web Site, other web sites and other forms of media about goods and services of interest to you.

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, check out:

<http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>

In layman’s terms: many advertisers use cookies for stuff like “hey you saw this ad already” or “ok, he clicked on a banner ad for leather pants, lets show this guy more of those as they travel around the web.” That’s all coming through Google’s Ad software – Destructoid doesn’t pass any behavioral data directly, period. We don’t share any information from your personal account with advertisers.

 **HEY YOU – USE COMMON SENSE IN ALL YOUR ONLINE ACTIVITIES**

Even the best policy can’t protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Unscrupulous advertisers, hackers, and scam artists are constantly searching the Internet looking for new targets. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your on-line activities.

Be aware that e-mail is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that third parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages, including online greetings. Anytime you visit a chat room or post a message to an on-line bulletin board, your e-mail address can be accessed by advertisers looking to compile lists for unsolicited commercial e-mail (also known as spam).

Be sure that you only disclose your e-mail address in circumstances in which it is safe to do so. Beware of scams in which persons unknown to you request your screen name, password, or credit card information. Make sure you verify the identity of anyone asking for personal information. Always monitor your children’s on-line activities and educate them as to the rules for safe Internet use.
