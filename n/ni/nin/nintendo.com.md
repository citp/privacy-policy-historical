**INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU**

In order to give you the best experience on our website, we may collect personal and non-personal information. Non-personal information includes anonymous information such as demographic data. Under all circumstances, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives. Please read below for a description of each type of information collected. 

·       **Personal Information** is information that can be used to identify you such as your name, address, telephone number, or email address. We do not collect any Personal Information about you unless you choose to provide it to us. If you choose not to provide Personal Information, you may be unable to use certain features on our website. 

·       **Demographic Information** is **anonymous** information such as a person’s age, date of birth, gender, hobbies, interests, zip/postal code or country.  Demographic Information is not considered Personal Information unless it is linked to Personal Information about a specific user.  Demographic Information may be collected for an activity that also requires Personal Information, in which case we may combine the Demographic Information with your Personal Information. Combining data allows us to customize the notices we send you and the content we provide you according to your interests and preferences.  If we do combine your Demographic Information with your Personal Information, we then treat all of that data as Personal Information. If you choose not to provide certain Demographic Information, you may not be able to use certain features on this website.

·       **Aggregate Information** is anonymous data about individuals that is grouped together to study a group or category of services or users. Aggregate Information is not considered Personal Information unless it is linked to Personal Information about a specific user. 

**COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We request Personal and Demographic Information to respond to your requests and provide services to you such as: registering for and participating in Club Nintendo; sending email newsletters; participating in online contests and sweepstakes; sending e-cards and wish lists; processing orders through our online store; setting up repair orders; posting online resumes and using media applications; and sending email correspondence.   Please note that information you submit may be sent to or shared with Nintendo of America Inc. in the United States.  Each category below describes how we handle the requested information. 

**"Club Nintendo" Registration**

Individuals at least 13 years of age may register for a Club Nintendo account on [**https://club.nintendo.com/**](https://club.nintendo.com/). **  **All information you submit on Club Nintendo will be provided directly to Nintendo of America Inc. in the United States.  Certain Personal Information will be requested during registration. For children under the age of 13, we have developed a Family Account system. In order for a child under 13 to have a Club Nintendo account, the child's parent or guardian must register for Club Nintendo and create a Family Account. That parent or guardian can then create sub-accounts for other family members. Thus, Club Nintendo registration does not collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. 

For further information regarding our children's online privacy, see the section "[ **COLLECTION**](http://www.nintendo.com/corp/privacy.jsp#children_privacy) **OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN** " below.  For additional information regarding Club Nintendo go to [**https://club.nintendo.com/**](https://club.nintendo.com/) **** and click on “How It Works”. 

**Newsletter(s)**

To subscribe to our newsletters, you can either provide your email address and country on various pages on our website or on the Nintendo.ca website.  You can also receive such newsletters by registering for a Club Nintendo account on [**https://club.nintendo.com/**](https://club.nintendo.com/) , as described above.   Please note that by subscribing to our newsletters, your information will be shared with Nintendo of America Inc. in the United States.  To receive communications from Nintendo concerning repairs or other transactions, you do not need to register for Club Nintendo. 

**Product Registration**

Only Club Nintendo members can register products to earn Coins.   Club Nintendo members under the age of 13 can register products to their Family Account but cannot spend or redeem Coins. More information regarding Coins is available in the Club Nintendo Terms and Conditions, available at http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/club/en/terms.jsp. 

**Online Contests and Sweepstakes**

To enter our online contests and sweepstakes, you may be required to provide us with certain Personal and/or demographic information about yourself. To learn more about the information collected and used for a specific contest or sweepstake, please see the official contest or sweepstakes rules. 

**Demographic and Opinion Information**

Club Nintendo surveys may request demographic or opinion information, such as your favorite games or which Nintendo systems you own. Responses will be linked to your Club Nintendo account and may be used to provide a more personalized online experience and, if your email and message settings allow, send you product newsletters and other communications we think you will enjoy. 

**E-cards and Wish Lists**

Web users who wish to send an e-card or their wish list to a friend or family member are required to give us their first name and the email address(es) of the person(s) to whom they wish to send the e-card or wish list. In general, we delete the senders' and recipients' email addresses after we send the e-card or wish list. Please note that some activities on our website allow registered Club Nintendo members and users 13 years or older to send game challenges to other users via e-cards. In such cases, we may store the senders' and recipients' email addresses until the game challenge has been completed, but we do not permanently store these email addresses or use them for any other purpose. 

**Repair Orders**

If you set up a repair order on our website, you will need to provide your name, mailing and billing addresses, phone number and email address. You may also need to provide a valid credit card number, expiration date and credit card security code. All financial information is transmitted by SSL protocol via our secure server. 

**Email Correspondence and Other Communication**

We may respond to email correspondence and communications you send to us. Because an email address is Personal Information, we protect the privacy of the sender by limiting access to these email messages. Only employees with a legitimate business need to access the emails are allowed to do so. For quality control purposes, email messages may be kept for a period of time. There may, however, be certain cases where hard copies may be kept on file, such as emails concerning product safety or consumer complaints. Information from email messages will not be used for marketing purposes and will be maintained in a secure location. 

**Online Interaction**

This website may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or newsgroups (“Public Forums”) available to users. Please remember that any information disclosed in Public Forums becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding whether to disclose your Personal Information in these Public Forums. 

**Linking Accounts**

If you have a Wii console, Nintendo DSi, Nintendo DSi XL or Nintendo 3DS system and are at least 13 years of age, you may link one of each product line to your Club Nintendo account.  Doing so will automatically register your Shop Account purchases so that you may receive surveys and coins. 

**DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We do not sell or rent Personal Information to third parties. We may share Personal Information with vendors who help us perform various internal functions necessary to operate our business. We may disclose Personal Information (a) in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law; (b) if doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to any claims; (d) to enforce the terms and conditions of our or other Nintendo owned websites; or (e) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Nintendo, our customers, or the public. We also may disclose your email address to our partners solely to send you email messages you have requested, or to ensure that you do not receive such messages if you have opted out of receiving them. Any vendors or partners with whom we may share Personal Information are permitted to obtain only the Personal Information they need to deliver the services requested. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. In addition, information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, sale, transfer of company assets, or acquisition, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable laws. 

**USE OF COOKIES, IP ADDRESSES AND WEB BEACONS**

We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files that a website places on your hard drive whenever you visit the website. These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit so that when you return to the website, it knows who you are and can personalize your visit. Cookies may be linked to Personal Information about you. Specifically, we use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and wish lists and to prevent you from having to reenter your registration data (such as user name and password) at each connection. In addition, we may use information collected by cookies, as well as other tools such as log files or Web beacons, for other purposes, such as helping us determine how to improve our website by seeing which areas, features, and products are most popular; personalizing the website and making recommendations based on products you have linked to in the past; and completing transactions you have requested. Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. If you disable this function, some areas of our website will not function properly. 

Please note that cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. 

We maintain log files, which contain Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. We do not link IP addresses to Personal Information, unless we notify you or unless necessary to enforce our website’s terms and conditions. In general, we use log files to monitor traffic on our website and to troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of abuse, however, we may block certain IP addresses. 

We may use a common Internet technology called "Web beacons" (also called "Web bugs," "action tags," "pixel trackers," or "clear GIFs") on our website. Web beacons are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message that are designed to allow us or our vendors to collect certain information and monitor user activity on our website. Web beacons are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We do not use Web beacons to collect Personal Information about you. We may use Web beacons to collect non-personal information such as the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web user comes from, and the time the Web beacon is activated (such as when you view the Web page, advertisement, or email that contains the Web beacon). In general, we do not link such non-personal information to Personal Information; however, we may use Web beacons to record whether individual users view emails from Nintendo. This allows us to more effectively manage our database of active registered members. We may also use Web beacons to display emails in the appropriate HTML or text format. From time to time, we may permit vendors to place Web beacons on our website or in emails sent on our behalf. Web beacons used by our vendors collect the same types of information and are treated in the same manner as specified above. 

**SECURITY**

The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. That's why we have technical, administrative, and physical security measures in place to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access and improper use. Personal Information is stored in firewall-protected servers. We will notify users of a data breach involving unencrypted Personal Information by email or by posting a notice on the affected website. We also strive to limit access to Personal Information to employees performing a legitimate business function. We review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods. Despite our efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. 

It is your responsibility to keep your Club Nintendo password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users. 

If you forget your Club Nintendo password, we will authenticate your identity by sending an email to the address in your account profile. For children under 13, we will send this email to the Family Account Administrator. 

**OPTING OUT**

If you do not want us to send you email, regular mail, or other messages about our products and services, you can opt-out at the time you register for Club Nintendo or other information collection. If you have opted-in and, at a later date, wish to have your name removed from our email or regular mail databases, you can log on to Club Nintendo and update your preferences by going to My Account Settings, Newsletters and Communications and then Communication Central.

If you would like to be removed from our mailing lists at any time, please send an email to [**remove@cmail.nintendo.com**](mailto:remove@cmail.nintendo.com). Put the word "REMOVE" in the subject line. In the body of the email, please include your name and address and the database(s) from which you would like your information to be removed. You may also remove yourself from our mailing lists by contacting our Privacy Administrators located in the United States at (888) 977-7627. Please note that in some instances, despite your opt-out selections, we may send you email communications regarding transactions or services you have specifically requested or to inform you of important changes to our website, products or policies. 

**CHECKING ACCOUNT INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY**

As a member of Club Nintendo, you may access your Personal Information by logging in and going to the "Club Nintendo" section of www.nintendo.ca. Once there, you may view and change your Personal Information at "My Account Settings." If you are not a registered member of Club Nintendo, access to your Personal Information is available by contacting us via email at **privacypolicy@noa.nintendo.com** or by phone at (888) 977-7627and we will review or update your information as appropriate. Please be aware that you will need to provide the updated information to our Online Administrators; to protect your privacy, we will not disclose information that we have on file. If you would like to delete your Personal Information, please contact us and we will delete it unless we have a good faith belief that we are legally required to retain the information. 

**COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN**

NOCL recognize a special obligation to protect Personal Information obtained from young children.  As such, we encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and instruct their children to never give out their real name, address or phone number, without their parent’s permission, when using the Internet.

**THIRD PARTY WEB SITES**

If you decide to provide Personal Information to any third party website linked from this website, the sharing of such information will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, not our privacy practices. Be cautious before providing any Personal Information to any third party. 

**INTERNATIONAL USERS**

Visitors to NOCL's web sites from outside of Canada are advised that this Privacy Policy is intended to meet the laws and requirements of Canada, which may not necessarily be the same as the laws and regulations of your home country. Nintendo of Canada Ltd. recommends that you **NOT** provide personal information if you are not a resident of Canada. Any information that you provide to NOCL online will be treated in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Provinces and the applicable laws of Canada.
