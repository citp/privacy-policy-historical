You will need to supply us with your PIN, your case reference number and a link to the information you want removed.

#### Disclosing personal information to third parties

We may be required to disclose personal information in response to requests from a court, tribunal, regulator, or otherwise as part of the litigation process or to protect the health and wellbeing of the public. Where possible, we will consult with you prior to making such a disclosure and, in order to protect your privacy, we will ensure that we will disclose only the minimum amount of your information and only as necessary in relation to the required purpose.

We may share your personal information with third parties such as law enforcement agencies, safeguarding bodies, other healthcare regulators, employers or potential future employers where this is necessary in the public interest to protect public safety, health and wellbeing or in the context of an investigation about your conduct.

We may share information relating to the status of your registration with the NMC with other EEA competent authorities if required. However, we will do this in line with relevant EEA legislation, particularly relating to data protection.

#### Research

We may ask whether you wish to take part in a research project. Participation is entirely voluntary and any information is collected with your consent.

Research related information may be held by external researchers with whom we are working. If you choose to provide us with information that identifies you, this will not be published in any reports.

#### Equality and diversity information

We are committed to treating everyone fairly and meeting our legal responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 and related legislation (such as the Human Rights Act 1998). One of the ways we do this is by asking people to provide information about their protected characteristics (such as ethnicity, disability, gender, sexual orientation, religion, beliefs).

Providing us this information is optional. If you choose to give it to us, we will keep it confidential and hold it securely in line with data protection and other relevant legislation. We will use the information you give us to analyse and report on nursing and midwifery education and practice in the UK. We will anonymise any data we publish so you cannot be identified and will only publish this data in aggregate form.
