## How long we retain your data

We generally store information about you for as long as we need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it, and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

If you create any forum posts, the post and its metadata are retained as long as your user account exists on our website, or until you or an administrator deletes it.

## What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments or forum posts, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

## Where we send your data

New Masters Academy uses data hosting service providers in the United States to host collected information, and we use technical measures to secure all data. Despite the thorough security measures and safeguards that New Masters Academy implements to protect data, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, New Masters Academy cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. New Masters Academy has policies in place in case of such situation and will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe.

Visitor comments and reviews may be checked through our automated spam detection service, [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) You can read about Askimet’s privacy policy [here](https://automattic.com/privacy/).
