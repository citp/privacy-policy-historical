# NMFN: Online Privacy Statement

When you would like to have a Northwestern Mutual Financial Network Representative or a Northwestern Mutual Financial Network recruiter contact you, we will ask you for:

  * your name
  * your street address
  * your phone number
  * your email address



Since life insurance is primarily state-regulated, and our Financial Representatives are licensed by state, we need your street address so that we may forward your information to the Network Office nearest you. Your name, phone number and/or email address enable you to be contacted, per your request.

This information is routed to our Financial Representatives via a third-party marketing firm, which is under contract to maintain this information in confidence. The Northwestern Mutual Financial Network does not share this information with any other party.

| 

We want to provide our customers with a means to communicate with us 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We do this through our Customer Service email forms.

In order to provide you with the service you need the most efficient way possible, we will ask you for:

  * your name
  * your social security number
  * your street address
  * your policy/annuity/IRA number
  * your Insurance Service Account number (if applicable)
  * your phone number
  * your email address



This information is for our internal use to service your request, so that we may access your customer information. It is not shared with any third party, unless permitted or required by law.

| 

Any other interactive forms or calculators on this Web site, including the Longevity Game, are there for your information only. Northwestern Mutual does not track, retain or use any of the data input into these forms, nor is the data in any way linked to you as an individual.

| 

To enable us to continually improve on the content we offer our users, as well as for systems administration purposes, we collect aggregate information site-wide. This gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

A cookie is a small piece of information a Web site can store on your computer. This small text file contains a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the Web site. This unique number identifies your Web browser to our computer system whenever you visit our site. A cookie will not allow a Web site to learn any personally identifiable information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed.

Cookies are currently used on most major Web sites and have become an industry standard. Most Web browser preferences can be adjusted to alert you that a cookie will be sent to your hard drive, or you can refuse to receive a cookie. While this Web site does not require you to use cookies, it is possible that certain services may not function properly if you choose to refuse to receive a cookie.

Clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, known as Web beacons, are small files that are placed on Web pages. Web beacons work with cookies and assist in gathering Web site statistics such as unique visitors and the number of times individual pages are displayed.

This site uses two types of cookies. We use session cookies to ensure better performance and a more enjoyable and consistent user experience from your entry point into our site. Session cookies are also used on the password-protected area of www.northwesternmutual.com, an area that can be accessed through this site. A session cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser when you access the site and is then stored temporarily in memory. The session cookie is available only during the course of the browser session; the information is not sent to or stored on your computer's hard drive. Closing your browser or logging off will invalidate the session cookie.

In addition, this site uses machine cookies, also known as persistent cookies, in connection with our voluntary "Tell Us What You Think" and "Customer Service on the Internet" surveys. When you take one of these voluntary surveys, a cookie is sent to and saved on your machine. This cookie will prevent you from again being asked to complete this survey when you revisit this site anytime during the subsequent six month period. This information is only collected in aggregate form. No personal information is collected.

Web beacons allow us to track audience size, to measure demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Web site, and analyze how and where we can best improve on the content we offer our users. This information is only collected in aggregate form. No personal information is collected.
