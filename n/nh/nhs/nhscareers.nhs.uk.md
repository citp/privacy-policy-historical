**Your rights as a data subject**

The General Data Protection Regulation includes a number of rights that are more extensive than those in the Data Protection Act 1998. We must generally respond to requests in relation to your rights within one month, although there are some exceptions to this.

The availability of some of these rights depends on the lawful basis that applies in relation to the processing of your personal data, and there are some other circumstances in which we may not uphold a request to exercise a right. Your rights and how they apply are described below.

**_Right to be informed_**

Your right to be informed is met in the main by the provision of this privacy notice. We may also provide you with certain information about our use of your data when we communicate with you directly.

**_Right of access_**

You have the right to obtain a copy of personal data that we hold about you and other information specified in the GDPR, although there are exceptions to what we are obliged to disclose.

**_Right to rectification_**

You have the right to ask us to rectify any inaccurate data that we hold about you. You can do this contacting us by [contacting us](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/contact-us). 

**_Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)_**

You have the right to request that we erase personal data about you that we hold. If you believe we have information about you, you can [contact us](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/contact-us) to find out. 

The right to erasure is not an absolute right, and depending on the legal basis that applies, we may have overriding legitimate grounds to continue to process the data.

**_Right to restriction of processing_**

You have the right to request that we restrict processing of personal data about you that we hold. You can ask us to do this for example where you contest the accuracy of the data.

**_Right to data portability_**

This right is only available where the legal basis for processing under the General Data Protection Regulation is consent, or for the purposes of a contract between you and us. For this to apply the data must be held in electronic form. The right is to be provided with the data in a commonly used electronic format so that you can transfer the data elsewhere. 

**_Right to object_**

You have the right to object to processing of personal data about you in certain circumstances. The right is not absolute and we may continue to process the data if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds to do so.

**_Rights in relation to automated individual decision-making including profiling_**

You have the right to object to being subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling. We do not currently have any automated decision-making processes, but in future should we perform any automated decision-making, we will record this in our privacy notice, and ensure that you have an opportunity to request that the decision involves personal consideration.

**_Rights in relation to direct marketing_**

We will only use your data for marketing purposes if you have subscribed to receive certain information or opted to receive marketing material. You can do this by logging into your account and updating your details, or you can also [contact us](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/contact-us), if you have previously consented by calling us or email.
