> **What are your rights under the Privacy Act of 1974?**  
>  The Privacy Act of 1974 protects the personal information the federal government keeps on you in “Systems of Records (SOR)” (information an agency controls that can be retrieved by name or some other personal identifier). The Privacy Act regulates how the government can disclose, share, provide access to, and maintain the personal information that it collects. Not all information collected online is covered by the Privacy Act.
> 
> The Act’s major provisions require agencies to:
> 
>   * Publish a Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register explaining the existence, character and uses of a new or revised SOR;
>   * Keep information about you accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to assure fairness in dealing with you; and
>   * Allow you to, upon request, access and review your information held in a SOR and request amendment of the information if you disagree with it.
> 

> 
> When the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) collects information from you online that is subject to the Privacy Act (i.e., information to be kept in a SOR), we will provide you, through a link on the web page from which we collect information, access to our **Privacy Act Notice** . This **Privacy Act Notice** will inform you what portion of the information is maintained and retrieved by your name or other personal identifier.
> 
> Each Privacy Act Notice will also notify you of the following:
> 
>   * The authority for and purpose and use of the collection of information subject to the Privacy Act;
>   * Whether providing the information is voluntary or mandatory; and
>   * The effects on you if you do not provide any or all of the requested information.
