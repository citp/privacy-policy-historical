**NOTICE TO PARENTS OF YOUR CHILDREN'S PRIVACY RIGHTS AND OUR INFORMATION COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND MAINTENANCE PRACTICES**

**An Important Note to Parents**

We are a **general audience web site** with a children's section. Because we understand that our entire web site may be appealing to children, we seek to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which requires parental consent before we collect personal information from any child under the age of 13 or disclose such information to any third parties. More information about this law can be found at [http://www.ftc.gov/.](http://www.ftc.gov/)

Children under the age of 13 are not authorized to submit personal information online without first getting the permission from a parent or guardian.

We encourage parents to take an active interest in their children's use of the Internet. Parents should be aware that software tools are available online that permit them to screen objectionable content and to prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission. However, the best protection for your child is for you to supervise your child's online activities.

If you have any questions about this policy or about how personal information collected on our website is used, you can contact us by e-mail at [policyquestions@nhra.com](mailto:policyquestions@nhra.com), or by regular U.S. mail to:

This notice explains what kind of information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it to others. If you give us permission to collect or use personal information from your child under age 13 and we make any material changes in how we plan to use that information, we will notify you of this change and require that you give us renewed permission for these new uses.

**What is Personal Information?**

When Do We Collect Personal Information from Your Child and What Kind of Information is Collected?

There are several forum in which we may actively collect information from your child under age 13, including: Jr. Membership, E-Newsletter, Contests and Polls, and the NHRA Store.

**1\. Jr. Membership**

We collect personal information from your child when your child registers to become an NHRA member. Specifically, we collect your child's name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, and gender, and may obtain credit card information to process the membership application. We also collect personal information from your child (i.e., name and mailing address) when your child requests that NHRA's Jr. Membership driving participants waiver forms be sent to them by mail.

**2\. E-Newsletter**

We collect personal information from your child when your child requests to be added to the NHRA E-Newsletter mailing list. Specifically, we collect your child's name and e-mail address. 

**3\. Contests and Polls**

We collect personal information from your child for participation in contests or sweepstakes. For our Jr. Dragster contest(s), we collect your child's name and e-mail address, and may collect your child's age, address, and phone number. From time to time, we offer polls or surveys on the NHRA website. Our site will prevent multiple votes made by the same IP address, but no personal information is collected. 

**4\. NHRA Store**

When your child wants to buy a product offered from our online NHRA store, we also collect the personal information necessary for the transaction such as name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card information.

**What Do We Do With the Personal Information We Collect?**

We may use the personal information we collect from your child to respond to user requests (e.g., to be added to the E-newsletter mailing list, to contact the winner of a prize, to keep membership records, or to verify or process transactions), or to provide children with information requested in a one-time transaction (e.g., responding to an inquiry about NHRA's next race event or location to purchase products). Personal information collected to comply with a child's one-time request will be discarded after NHRA has responded to the child's request. Non-personally identifying information, such as session cookies, will be used to help us improve and update our site based on recorded use. NHRA cannot, and does not, condition a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.

**Do We Disclose Personal Information About Your Child?**

We may disclose information we collect about your child from a membership transaction in the form of a member/subscriber record to other third party companies by way of sale, lease or rental agreement. The types of businesses in which such third parties are engaged include the following: racing, mail order parts, apparel, publishing, and other or related similar third-party marketers.

We may disclose the name and age of a winner of a NHRA contest in NHRA's print newspaper, Jr. DRAGSTER or displaying it on our website.

Should any child's parent not respond within ninety days thereafter, then we will delete that child's and his/her parent's information at that time.

We may collect your child's name and online contact information in order to respond on a one-time basis to a specific request from your child (i.e., upon request from the child, we may e-mail to the child information about our website). After responding the child's name and information will be deleted.

We may collect your child's and parent's name and online contact information in order to respond directly more than once to a specific request of the child (i.e., to provide membership publications, or a contest entry and subsequent award), but in these cases the child must first be registered with us as a Jr. Member as required under this policy before we will respond.
