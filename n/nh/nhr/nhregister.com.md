# New Haven Register - News - Privacy Policy

**Our Commitment to Privacy**  
Journal Register Company is committed to protecting your personal privacy. We provide this notice to explain the type of information we collect on Web sites owned by the Journal Register Company (www.journalregister.com) and how we use this information. Our Privacy Policy is available for you to review on the home page of every Journal Register Web site. 

**The Information We Collect**  
You may be asked to provide personal information to participate in programs or features of the site. These may include but are not limited to coupons, contests, surveys, forums and/or subscription. Your participation is voluntary and we will not require you to provide more information than is necessary to participate in any of our current or future Web site activities. In some instances, we may ask you questions on an aggregate basis (we don't identify you personally with the information) and such questions will be identified on the Web site. In all other instances, you should assume that we will track any information you provide on a personally identifiable basis. 

**Parents and children**  
Journal Register Company does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Children ages 13 to 17 must get the permission of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) before making purchases, including subscriptions, on Journal Register Company sites. 

**The Way We Use Information**  
Journal Register Company Web sites may provide you with the opportunity to register on the site. Registration may be required to be eligible to receive savings offers, enter online contests or sweepstakes or receive specialized content. Journal Register Company may use the information you provide when registering to fulfill prizes.

When you register with our Web site, you may elect to receive information and updates on our products and services. You will always have an opportunity to decline receiving such communications.

We may use information that you provide (individual and aggregate) to better design our Web site and to improve our marketing strategy and our products. One method through which this Web site collects aggregate information is the collection of IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from this Web site, our servers or third-party servers contracted by Journal Register Company may log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. To the extent such information is shared with third parties, please see "Our Privacy Practices With Third Parties" below.

Occasionally, you will have the opportunity to forward pages or information on the site to friends. The information you provide to facilitate this email communication is used on a one-time basis and is not collected or retained by Journal Register Company. 

We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so.

**Unsubscribe/Delete**  
Journal Register Company gives users the following options for managing or removing their information from our database:

1\. Send us an email: Send an email to webmaster@journalregister.com. Be sure to include your name and clear instructions on what you would like us to do. 

2\. Send us mail, or call us: Send us your request via the mail. Be sure to include your name and clear instructions on what you would like us to do. Send to: Journal Register Company, Online Privacy Policy, 50 W. State St., Trenton, NJ 08608. Telephone: 609-396-2200.

**Use of Cookies**  
Cookies are files or pieces of information that may be stored in your computer's hard drive when you visit a Web site. We may use cookies to better tailor our site and our products to your interests and needs. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities or to improve your user experience by remembering the information that you have already provided to us. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during membership registration or a contest). The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most Web sites. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent so that you can flush them from your browser if you object to their presence. 

Our Privacy Practices with Third Parties We may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. We do not provide any identifiable personal information to any third party for any purpose whatsoever unless you register or subscribe for their services.

Our intention is never to use or share personally identifiable information provided to us in ways that are different than the ways described above without also providing you with an opportunity to "unsubscribe" or prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Links to Other Sites**  
You should be aware that when you are on Journal Register Web sites you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There may be links to other sites that take you outside our service. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors, and partners that may use the Journal Register logo. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, or otherwise collect data or solicit personal information. Always be aware of where you end up. Check the linked site to locate its Privacy Policy, which may be different from our own. If the Journal Register Web site links you to any third party Web site, Journal Register makes no representation as to the existence, sufficiency, accuracy or completeness of its Privacy Policy. 

**Our Commitment to Data Security:**  
We take reasonable precautions to keep your personal information secure. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk. 

**Changes in Our Policy**  
We reserve the right to change or remove this Privacy Policy at our discretion. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy we will post those changes here. We encourage you to visit this area frequently to stay informed. We will not make any changes, which allow us to give personal information to a third party without obtaining permission from you first. 

**Your Consent To This Privacy Policy**  
By using this Web site, you signify your assent to the Journal Register Company Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any term in this Policy, please do not use this site or submit any personally identifiable information.
