  3. **_How We Share the Information We Collect or Receive._**

We may share information that we collect or receive with third parties when we have your consent or as described below.

We may share information with the following types of third parties:

    * **Our affiliates**. We may share information with current and future "affiliates", a term that includes our parent and subsidiary companies, joint venture partners, or other companies we control, are controlled by, or with which we are under common control. Such affiliates may include those listed here.
    * **Our service providers**. We may provide information about you to service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf (for example, hosting our Services, storing our data, fulfilling orders, providing products and services, managing databases, performing analyses, administering our contests and sweepstakes, collecting location data, providing location-based services, processing credit card payments, providing customer service, or sending communications for us). These companies are contractually limited in the ways in which they may use this information.
    * **Operational partners**. We partner with third parties to operate certain of our Services. From time to time, in accordance with applicable laws, we may provide information about you to these operational partners to use for their own purposes. For example, we partner with MLB Advanced Media, L.P. ("MLBAM") to operate certain Services, and we therefore may share information about you with MLBAM, its successors and permitted assigns, and their affiliates in connection with the operation of our Services and where it is otherwise permitted by applicable law. 

While these operational partners may use information about you to operate the Services, you should presume that these operational partners may use your information for their own purposes in accordance with their respective privacy policies. You can view a list of some of our key operational partners [here.](https://web.archive.org/info/nhl-affiliates-member-clubs#operational)

    * **Business partners.** With your consent, we may share information about you with other select business partners that are not service providers, such as our sponsors, other retailers, and broadcast partners, so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional materials, and other materials that may be of interest to you. 

These other business partners are expected to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of any information we share with them. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners, which may use your information for their own purposes. You can view a list of some of our key business partners [here.](https://web.archive.org/info/nhl-affiliates-member-clubs#business)

    * **Member Clubs**. We may share information about you with our Member Clubs (including your contact information, demographic information, and information about your interactions with the NHL), and our Member Clubs may use this information for purposes including: providing you with special offers, promotional materials, and other information that may be relevant to you, improving their products and services, and performing internal analysis. Where required by applicable law, we will seek your consent before sharing your information with the Member Clubs for promotional purposes. Please note that Member Clubs' websites and services are not controlled by the NHL and are subject to their own individual privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Member Clubs. You can view a list of our Member Clubs [here.](https://web.archive.org/info/nhl-affiliates-member-clubs#member)
    * **Other parties in response to legal process or when necessary to protect us or our Services.** We or our service providers may disclose your information -- including the contents of your communications -- to other parties when required or permitted by applicable law, such as when we have a good faith belief that: 
      * Doing so is necessary to respond to lawful governmental requests or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena);
      * The information is relevant to a crime that has been or is being committed;
      * An emergency exists that poses a threat to your safety or the safety of another person or persons; or
      * Doing so is necessary to protect our rights or property or to enforce our Terms of Service.
    * **Other parties in connection with certain business transactions**. In the event that the ownership of the NHL (or any portion of our assets) changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, your information may be transferred to another entity. If such a transaction occurs, we will notify you in an update to this Privacy Policy or through another appropriate means.
    * **Interactive features**. We may share information with third parties when you post information to a public user profile or a public area of our Services, such as a chat room, forum, blog, or other community tool. If you post information to these interactive features, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. We cannot ensure that parties who have access to such information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when using these features.

We also may share other information with third parties in a manner that does not identify particular users, including, for example, aggregated information.

  4. **_Third Parties That Provide Content, Advertising, or Functionality On Our Services._**

Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. Such third parties include, for example:

    * **Content providers** , which may operate contests, sweepstakes, fantasy or interactive games, or public forums on our Services;
    * **Retail and other companies** (such as those that operate our Shop and Auctions Services and those that operate other Services), which may process transactions, provide customer service, and perform other related functions;
    * **Advertising providers** , which help us and our advertisers provide ads (on our Services or elsewhere online) that are tailored to users' interests and understand users' response to those ads;
    * **Audience-measurement companies** , which help us measure the overall usage of our Services and compare that usage to other online services; and
    * **Social networking services** (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+), which enable you to log in to certain of our Services, to comment on content available on our Services, and to share things you find on our Services with your social network.
    * **Mobile location analytics providers** , which use location-specific data to facilitate the transmission of informational, marketing, and public service communications to you.

These and other third parties may collect or receive information about your use of our Services, including through the use of **cookies, web beacons, and other technologies** , and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services, including, for example, to deliver ads that are more relevant to you, both on and off our websites. Social networking services may be able to collect information about you, even if you do not click on or interact with their content on our Services or have an account with the social networking service.

Note that some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads. To learn more and to opt out of such targeted advertising from participating companies, please visit the websites of the [Network Advertising Intiative](http://www.aboutads.info/)[, Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/), and [the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada.](http://youradchoices.ca/)

The third party social networking services with which we partner may notify your friends and other connections, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your friends and other contacts on those social networking services. We may use the information pursuant to this Privacy Policy, but the main purpose for our use is to enhance your personal and social experience on our Services. For example, we might show you content that is popular among your friends or connections on a social networking service or provide you with a snapshot of the responses of your friends and other connections to that content.

You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign in to certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.

  5. **_Notice to Rogers Communications Subscribers._**

If you access NHL.TV or Rogers NHL GameCentre LIVE by logging into your account with Rogers Communications Partnership, Rogers Communications Partnership and its affiliates ("Rogers") may receive information from the NHL about your use of NHL.TV, such as the type of content watched, dates of activity, amount of time spent on NHL.TV, and type of device used to access NHL.TV. Rogers will use this information for the purposes of offering and operating NHL.TV in Canada, tailoring communications to you, and understanding and improving its products and service offerings. Rogers will use and handle the information it receives in connection with NHL.TV in accordance with the Rogers privacy policy available at <http://www.rogers.com/web/content/Privacy-Policy> and not with this Privacy Policy. In addition, when you use your MyRogers login to access NHL.TV, Rogers NHL GameCentre LIVE, or other NHL content, the NHL will receive certain account-related information from Rogers (such as your name, username, contact information and type of subscription) and will use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including to identify you as a NHL.TV user, to tailor content and communications, and to better understand and improve its products and service offerings.

  6. **_"Do Not Track" Signals._**

Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites and online services should do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals.

These technologies are similar to cookies in that they are stored on your device and can be used to maintain information about your activities and preferences.

However, these other local storage technologies may use parts of your device other than your browser, which means you may not be able to control their use using the browser tools and settings you use to control browser cookies. For more information about managing Flash cookies, please visit the [Adobe Flash Player website](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html).

 ** _Web Beacons_**

Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on Web pages, videos, and in emails that can communicate information about your browser and device to a server. Beacons can be used, among other things, to count the users who visit a Web page or read an email, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a user viewing a Web page or email.
