## Nevada Health Link Privacy Policy

Nevada Health Link will collect sensitive information from consumers in order to perform Nevada Health Link functions, such as enrollment in qualified health plans (QHPs) and eligibility for advance payments of the [premium](https://www.nevadahealthlink.com/glossary/premium/) tax credit ([APTC](https://www.nevadahealthlink.com/glossary/advance-premium-tax-credit-aptc/)) and cost sharing reductions (CSR). Personally-identifiable consumer information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) are protected by federal law and state laws. This Privacy Policy describes how information about covered persons or Nevada Health Link applicants may be used, disclosed, and accessed.

### What information will be collected?

Nevada Health Link will only collect the minimum information required to achieve its mission of providing affordable health insurance to individuals and small businesses in the State of Nevada.

This information will not be shared with any other person or entity unless it is required to determine eligibility or to enroll in a qualified health plan.

In order to facilitate enrollment in Nevada Health Link, and to determine eligibility for enrollment in qualified health plans (QHPs), advance payments of the [premium](https://www.nevadahealthlink.com/glossary/premium/) tax credit ([APTC](https://www.nevadahealthlink.com/glossary/advance-premium-tax-credit-aptc/)), and cost sharing reductions (CSR), Nevada Health Link must collect information necessary to authenticate identity, citizenship status, residency, income, and incarceration status.

• **Citizenship Data:** Social Security Number, Resident Alien Number, Native American Tribe ID Number, Incarceration Status

This information is captured during the application and enrollment process and is used during annual open enrollments to provide an expedited enrollment experience.  To improve the Nevada Health Link portal and the overall usability of the site, some data regarding page views, browsing behavior, and system response times may also be collected. All personal data changes, eligibility results, plan selections, and any other action performed by the user will be tracked for audit and appeals purposes.

Each interaction between an individual and Nevada Health Link or the Customer Contact Center will also be documented along with any communications, notifications, or emails.

**How do I know my information will be protected?**

Information collected by Nevada Health Link during the enrollment process is protected by several federal and state laws, including provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), IRS Code, and Nevada regulations. In addition, Nevada Health Link has policies and procedures in place to ensure information security and privacy.  The following laws and guidelines are important safeguards in the protection of information shared with the Nevada Health Link:

45 CFR § 155.260 states that Nevada Health Link may only use PII to determine eligibility for enrollment in qualified health plans, to determine eligibility for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and to determine eligibility for exemptions from the [individual mandate](https://www.nevadahealthlink.com/glossary/individual-mandate/) to maintain health insurance coverage.  Nevada Health Link will fully comply with this federal regulation. Nevada Health Link will not create, collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information for any purposes that are not authorized under this regulation.1  The following principles are outlined in the regulation:

  * **Individual Access:** Individuals will be provided with a simple and timely means to access and obtain their personally identifiable health information


  * **C** **orrection:** Individuals will be provided with a timely means to dispute the accuracy of their personally identifiable health information and to have erroneous information corrected


  * **Op** **enness and transparency:** All policies, procedures, and technologies that affect individuals and their personally identifiable information are fully disclosed to the public


  * **Individual choice:** Individuals will be provided a reasonable opportunity and capability to make informed decisions about the collection, use, and disclosure of their personally identifiable health information


  * **C** **ollection, use, and disclosure limitations:** Personally identifiable health information will be created, collected, used, and/or disclosed only to the extent necessary to accomplish the goals of Nevada Health Link


  * **D** **at** **a quality and integrity:** Persons and entities will take reasonable steps to ensure that personally identifiable health information is complete, accurate, and up- to-date to the extent necessary to provide services to the members of Nevada Health Link


  * **S** **af** **eguards:** Personally identifiable health information is protected with reasonable operational, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability and to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure


  * **Accountability:** These principles are implemented, and adherence assured, through independent security audits by a third party.



**Nevada Health Link will maintain operational, technical, administrative and physical safeguards**

Consistent with all applicable laws and regulations, Nevada Health Link will ensure that all information is protected through effective administrative and operational procedures maintained by Nevada Health Link.

  * Nevada Health Link will ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all personally identifiable information that is created, collected, used, or disclosed by Nevada Health Link.


  * Personally identifiable information will be used by, or disclosed to, only those authorized to receive or view it. PPACA section 1411 states that “an applicant for insurance coverage or for a [premium](https://www.nevadahealthlink.com/glossary/premium/) tax credit or cost-sharing reduction shall be required to provide only the information strictly necessary to authenticate identity, determine eligibility, and determine the amount of the credit or reduction.” It also states that this information must be used only for Nevada Health Link operations (such as verification of eligibility for enrollment, cost-sharing reduction, or [premium](https://www.nevadahealthlink.com/glossary/premium/) tax credit). Penalties of up to $25,000 per violation exist for anyone who knowingly and willfully violates this restriction.2


  * Tax return information will be kept confidential in accordance with section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS will disclose certain available items of federal tax return information to the Data Services Hub after an individual submits an application for financial assistance in obtaining health coverage with Nevada Health Link or state agencies that administer Medicaid, CHIP, or basic health plans. The items that will be disclosed through the Data Services Hub are described under Internal Revenue Code section 6103(l)(21)(A) and the regulations issued under that section. Internal Revenue Code section 6103 protects the confidentiality of federal tax return information.3  Disclosure of federal tax return information to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is allowed in order to implement eligibility determinations for health insurance affordability programs, within the confidentiality requirements in Internal Revenue Code section 6103.4


  * Personally identifiable information will be protected against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such information.


  * Personally identifiable information will be protected against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures that are not permitted or required by law.


  * Personally identifiable information will be securely destroyed or disposed of in an appropriate and reasonable manner and in accordance with retention schedules.



**Nevada Health Link will maintain appropriate security controls**

  * Nevada Health Link will ensure that its workforce complies with all information safeguards and security controls.
  * Nevada Health Link will monitor, periodically assess, and update security controls to ensure the continued effectiveness of those controls.
  * Nevada Health Link will require, as a condition of contracts and agreements, the same or more stringent privacy and security standards and controls to Navigators, agents, brokers or other contractors authorized to access any personally identifiable information.
  * Nevada Health Link will use secure electronic interfaces when sharing personally identifiable information electronically. PPACA section 1413 requires the establishment of secure electronic interfaces with state health subsidy programs allowing the Nevada Health Link to be consistent with privacy and security standards in section 1942 of the Social Security Act. Nevada Health Link will ensure that all data matching and data sharing arrangements between Nevada Health Link and agencies administering the Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program meet all requirements applicable to Nevada Health Link as well as all requirements applicable under Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.



**Nevada Health Link Will Comply With Nevada Privacy and Information Security  ** **P** **olicies and Standards**
