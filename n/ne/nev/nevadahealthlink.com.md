# Privacy Policy

Nevada Health Link will collect sensitive information from consumers in order to perform Nevada Health Link functions, such as enrollment in qualified health plans (QHPs) and eligibility for advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC) and cost sharing reductions (CSR). Personally-identifiable consumer information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) are protected by federal law and state laws. This Privacy Policy describes how information about covered persons or Nevada Health Link applicants may be used, disclosed, and accessed.

Nevada Health Link will only collect the minimum information required to achieve its mission of providing affordable health insurance to individuals and small businesses in the State of Nevada. The information collected during the application process, enrollment, customer support, and renewals will only be used to ensure the efficient operation of the Nevada Health Link, verify the eligibility of an individual to enroll through Nevada Health Link or to claim a premium tax credit or cost-sharing reduction, and the amount of the credit or reduction. This information will not be shared with any other person or entity unless it is required to determine eligibility or to enroll in a qualified health plan.

In order to facilitate enrollment in Nevada Health Link, and to determine eligibility for enrollment in qualified health plans (QHPs), advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC), and cost sharing reductions (CSR), Nevada Health Link must collect information necessary to authenticate identity, citizenship status, residency, income, and incarceration status. This data includes, but is not limited to:

  * **Demographic Data:** Name, Address, Phone Number, Email, Age
  * **Income Data:** Tax Filing Status, Marriage Status, Tax Dependents, Employer, Annual or Monthly Income
  * **Citizenship Data:** Social Security Number, Resident Alien Number, Native American Tribe ID Number, Incarceration Status

  * **Payment Information:** Credit Card Numbers, Checking Account Numbers
  * **Health Insurance Coverage Information:** Past and current health insurance coverage, tobacco use, consumer plan selections, and other information necessary to facilitate enrollment
  * **Pre-Authorizations, Current Episodic Status, Continuity of Care, etc:** For individuals and families enrolling in Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO) Transition Qualified Health Plans who were formerly enrolled in a MCO Medicaid Plan, pre-authorized care and prescriptions, current treatment plans, and other continuity of care information will be transferred between the MCO Medicaid Plan and that MCO’s Transition Qualified Health Plan to ensure continuity of care for this special population.



This information is captured during the application and enrollment process and is used during annual open enrollments to provide an expedited enrollment experience.

To improve the Nevada Health Link portal and the overall usability of the site, some data regarding page views, browsing behavior, and system response times may also be collected. All personal data changes, eligibility results, plan selections, and any other action performed by the user will be tracked for audit and appeals purposes.

Each interaction between an individual and Nevada Health Link or the Customer Contact Center will also be documented along with any communications, notifications, or emails. The primary purpose of recording this information is to help improve the efficiency of the Customer Service Center, Nevada Health Link Operations, and to support the appeals process.

Nevada Health Link will only share information with insurance carriers, and state and federal agencies as required to process requests for enrollment in QHP’s and to determine eligibility for health coverage, advance payments of the premium tax credit, and cost sharing reductions. The following table outlines the entities Nevada Health Link will share data with, and how that data is used. All entities that receive data from Nevada Health Link are required to support the same level of data security standards as Nevada Health Link itself.
