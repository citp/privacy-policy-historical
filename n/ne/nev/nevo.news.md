# Privacy Policy – Nevo News

Nevo News (“ **Nevo News** “) operates Nevo News and may operate other websites. It is Nevo News policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Nevo News collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Nevo News purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Nevo News visitors use its website. From time to time, Nevo News may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
