We encourage you to read our privacy statement to understand what types of personally identifiable information we collect and how we use this information.

**Information collected by NewsYaps and how it is used**  
NewsYaps only collects the necessary personally identifiable information in order to respond to your requests for our customized products and services. Personally identifiable information includes, but is not limited to, first and last name, physical address, e-mail address, phone number, birth date, and any other information that itself identifies or when tied to the above information, may identify you as a specific individual.

NewsYaps may also carefully select other companies to send you information about their products or services which are related to the site’s service but are not necessary to its operation (an “Extended Service”). If NewsYaps intends to use personally identifiable information for an Extended Service, the NewsYaps site will provide you with the ability and requisite instructions to decline this service. You may also stop the delivery of informational or promotional mail from NewsYaps by following the instructions on the mail.

Your use of such features and disclosure of any personal details (e.g. e-mail address) by you through these features are at your sole risk and NewsYaps accepts no responsibility for the same. However, if your privacy has been intruded as a result of participating in such features, you could notify us by e-mail at privacy.newsyaps [a t] techmonkey [d o t] in
