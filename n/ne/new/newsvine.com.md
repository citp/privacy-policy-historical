# Newsvine - Newsvine Privacy Policy

(Last Updated: November 15, 2005)

At Newsvine, Inc. (" ** _Newsvine_** ", " ** _we_** ," or " ** _us_** "), we are committed to ensuring the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy (" ** _Policy_** ") describes how personal information is collected from users of the Newsvine's Web site located at `www.newsvine.com` (" ** _Site_** "), and how that information is used and disclosed. By using our Site, you consent to the terms of this Policy.

## What is Personal Information?

Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as a user's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number, and information about that individual's activities when directly linked to that person such as information about his or her purchases or use of services. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you.

Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services to user desires.

## Personal Information We Collect

You provide personal information to us in a number of ways when you visit our Site or use the various services and activities available on our Site.

We also collect personal information from you if you submit a job application or resume to us via email. Personal information collected in this regard includes your name and email address, as well as other employment related information that you provide to us in the resume and/or application.

When you visit our Site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type and the time and date of your visit. This information is collected through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by a Web site to give you a unique identification. We also use cookies on our Site to keep track of services you have used, to record registration information regarding your login name and password, to ensure you do not repeatedly see advertisements, to record your user preferences and to keep you logged into the Site. We treat automatically collected information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the personally identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.

Additionally, we use, and allow third parties to use, Web beacons on the Site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes.
