Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are “session cookies”, meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end on a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may mot be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently.

 **3\. Our Disclosure of Your Personal Information.**

We do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. The following describes some of the ways in which your personal information may be disclosed in the normal course of business as we provide our users with our services.

 **Community Marketplace.** After registration, every user has the ability to determine the extent to which they would like their personal information shared on the website. Users may choose to keep their entire personal information private (except mandatory-shared information such as user screen name, city, state, country, or share all of their personal information. Your mandatory-shared information is displayed on the website when you are logged in and is therefore available to the public. Your personal information that is optional to share is: first name, last name, address, postal code, phone number, and email address. You do not have to share your optional personal information on the website(s). Also, your user name and password are never displayed to the public. However, you have the ability to change your password if necessary. The “Edit My User Account” link of the user’s Account Preferences section is the place where changes to personal information can be made.

 **Social Network.** As with the Marketplace Network, every user has the ability to determine the extent to which they would like their personal information shared on the Social Network (such as blogs) of this website (s). The “Edit My User Account” link of the user’s Account Preferences section is the place where changes to personal information can be made. Should a user choose to send personal information, of any kind, whether it be information contained in the “personal information” section of the user account page or any other personal information that the user deems to share with other users of this website(s); user holds the owner of this website harmless and releases it from consequences of dissemination of personal information sent freely by user. This company has no control over personal information disseminated other than such personal information contained on the user’s “personal information” section of the users account page.

 **Internal Service Providers.** We may use third parties to help facilitate certain aspects of our business that we provide for you and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose or reason other than the specific service they are providing for us. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is regulated by their applicable privacy policy.

 **Third Party Advertisers** We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.

 **Legal Requests.** Due to subpoenas, court orders, government regulations and our rights to defend against legal claims, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Although we strive to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee, nor should you expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

Under no circumstances, except as defined in this section, can you disclose information about another user to any third party without the consent of that user. You agree that other users may use your personal information to communicate with you in accordance with this section. You agree to give users an opportunity to remove themselves from your database and review what information you may have collected about them.

The Company will not tolerate spam. You are not authorized to add a user or users to your mailing list without their express consent.

 **6\. Changing your Personal Information.**

We give you the ability to review and change the personal information you have submitted to us. This is done by logging into this website and entering your new information.
