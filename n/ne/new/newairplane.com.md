# Privacy Policy | Boeing Commercial Airplanes

### General Privacy Policy

Thank you for reviewing the Privacy Policy for NewAirplane.com (the "Site"). Boeing is sensitive to confidentiality in online dealings and is committed to protecting individual privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform users about the general approach Boeing uses in collecting, using and disseminating user information by means of NewAirplane.com. 

**What data do we collect automatically and why?**   
When you visit NewAirplane.com and you have not otherwise identified yourself (for example, by joining the World Design Team), our web server automatically recognizes your domain name, but not your e-mail address. We collect the domain name and monitor general site use and traffic patterns to improve our web site and the products and services we offer. Boeing uses web server logs to collect data for metric purposes. Examples of the types of data collected on the logs are IP addresses, referral pages, date and time of Site access, and Site visited. We may use collected data to customize the content or layout of our pages for each individual visitor. Boeing may use the information you provide to send you future communications about Boeing and issues that may be of interest to you.

**Do we use cookies or tracers?**   
Cookies are small data files placed on your hard drive by a website server when you visit the site. NewAirplane.com uses cookies for tracking purposes (for example, to personalize your experience of the Site) and to make the Site easier to use. Cookies are currently the only way to effectively identify a unique anonymous visitor and understand how the visitor navigates our web site. An anonymous visitor to our site remains anonymous in all cases. We do not attempt to identify visitors if they do not voluntarily submit personal information to us. With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Cookies offer enhanced functionality to the user, but whether you allow a cookie to be placed on your computer is up to you! 

In some instances, we use tracking scripts or "tracers" that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on your hard drive when you register for the World Design Team. For example, when you visit the Site home page, a tracer recognizes whether you've previously signed up for the World Design Team. For Design Team members, we also use tracking scripts or "tracers" to determine what links are clicked by users from the Flight Log newsletter. For instance, we use tracking scripts or "tracers" to determine what links are clicked by users from the World Design Team Flight Log newsletter. This information is used by Boeing solely to gauge the success of our newsletter, featured content on the Site or other e-mail or web site items relating to the World Design Team. We do not use tracers to gather information on your use of the Internet unrelated to Boeing. Please note that Boeing does not use tracers to identify your personal information, and your page-browsing activity on the Site remains anonymous.

**Do we collect personal information?**   
Boeing requests personally identifiable information from you before you participate in certain portions of the Site, for example if you register to become a member of the World Design Team. Examples of personally identifiable information collected if you register include e-mail addresses, country of residence and whether you are over 18 years of age. Please note that we do not consider aggregated information, from which personally identifiable information has been removed, to be private.

**What happens if I register?**   
Registration is not required for general browsing on the Site. However, if you so choose, you may join the World Design Team by registering to receive e-mail and newsletters, participate in surveys and access content specially prepared for Design Team members. There is no fee for registration, and you may choose to unsubscribe at any time by clicking "unsubscribe" in the World Design Team Flight Log or returning to the registration page on [www.newairplane.com/register](https://web.archive.org/register/) and changing your preferences. Please also note that Boeing may collect registration data in order to monitor compliance with the terms of use governing the Site and to set up access permissions to certain Boeing Sites.

**What security is provided?**   
NewAirplane.com does not conduct or allow transactions for which heightened security is required. Please note that we do not treat your general interaction with NewAirplane.com (e.g., completion of surveys, submission of suggestions) as confidential. See General Submissions in Site Terms. 

**When would we disclose your information?**   
We do not rent, sell or trade any personally identifiable information about you (for example, e-mail addresses) to third parties. 

**What about children's privacy?**   
Boeing asks children under 13 not to transmit any information to the Site. Boeing welcomes the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 to use the Site and provide any information, service, or product gained from the Site to its child. We ask that World Design Team members be 18 years or older.

**What if data is transmitted internationally?**   
If you are one of our international guests, we realize that you may want to know whether your personal information will be transferred out of your country of origin. Please be aware that when you register or request a transaction on NewAirplane.com, your personal data may be transferred to computers in the United States in order to process your request. 

**Does this apply to all of the Boeing Sites?**   
Through NewAirplane.com, you may link to many networked web pages and web sites operated by Boeing and its subsidiaries and affiliates (together, the "Boeing Sites"). Not all of them have adopted this policy. Individual Boeing Sites may adopt different privacy policies that fit transactions taking place on that Boeing Site. If a Boeing Site has its own privacy policy, the provisions of that policy will control if they conflict with this general policy. Also, some Boeing Sites are intended to facilitate interaction with other businesses and may not adopt a privacy policy for individuals. Users of those Sites should check with their employer regarding the employer's arrangements with Boeing and applicable privacy practices. 

**What about external links?**   
For the convenience of our Site visitors, Boeing may provide links to third-party web sites that are external to Boeing. These web sites are not operated or controlled by Boeing, and Boeing is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such external web sites. 

**How do we keep current?**   
From time to time, Boeing may revise this Privacy Policy at its discretion. We note the date of the policy below, so you know when it was last updated. Boeing advises you to check back periodically to review the Privacy Policy because users of the Site will be prospectively bound by the then-current version of this Privacy Policy.
