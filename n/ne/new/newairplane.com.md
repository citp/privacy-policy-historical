# Boeing: Privacy and Cookie Policy

Thank you for reviewing the Boeing Privacy and Cookie Policy (“Policy”). The Boeing Company and its family of companies (“Boeing”) are sensitive to the issue of confidentiality in online interactions and are committed to protecting individual privacy across our range of websites, products and services (“Sites”). This Policy is intended to inform you about the approach Boeing Sites displaying this Policy follow when collecting, using and disclosing your information.

**What data do we collect automatically and why?**  
When you visit Boeing Sites and you have not otherwise identified yourself (e.g., via registration with a Boeing Site), our web servers automatically recognize your domain name, but not your e-mail address. We collect the domain name and monitor general site use and traffic patterns to improve the Sites that we offer. Boeing uses web server logs to collect data for metrics purposes. Examples of the types of data collected in the logs are IP addresses, referral pages, date and time of site access, and site visited. We may use collected data to customize the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual visitor.

**Do we use cookies or tracers on our Sites?**  
Cookies are small data files placed on your device by a website when you visit. Boeing may use cookies set by us or other companies for tracking purposes or to make our Sites easier to use. Cookies are currently the best way to effectively identify unique website visitors and understand how they navigate our Sites. Like many websites, we do not currently respond to “do not track” browser headers. But with most internet browsers, you can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies from your device and by setting your browser to block all cookies or warn you before a cookie is stored. Cookies offer enhanced functionality to the user, but whether you allow a cookie to be placed on your device is up to you.

In some instances, Boeing uses tracking scripts or "tracers" that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on your device by another website. These are used by Boeing to gauge the success of our programs, such as advertising campaigns. For instance, we may use a tracer to determine whether you visit our employment pages after visiting a resume or career site where we placed a banner ad.

While our cookie names may change over the course of time, they generally fall into the following categories:

**Categories**

**Examples**

Site Features   
and Processes

These cookies help us deliver products and services that you expect, such as maintaining your shopping cart, processing payments, navigating around Sites, and using live chat to interact with customer service representatives. Some of these cookies may be placed on your device by a third party with which we contract to provide certain services. Without these cookies, our Sites cannot function properly.  
  
Site Preferences

| 

These cookies allow our Sites to remember information that changes the way the Site behaves or looks, such as your preferred language or the region you are in. These cookies can also assist you in changing text size, font and other parts of web pages that you can personalize. Without these cookies, our Sites cannot function properly.

These cookies help us improve our Sites and your browsing experience. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not impact Site functionality. For details and to opt out, see section “Do we use cookies or tracers on our Sites?”.  
  
Analytics

| 

These cookies help us understand how visitors engage with our Sites through collection of usage statistics. Examples of the types of data collected include IP addresses, referral pages, date and time of Site access, and Site visited. Some of these cookies may be placed on your device by a third party with which we contract to provide certain services. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not impact Site functionality. For details and to opt out, see section “Do third parties use cookies or tracers on our Sites?”.  
  
Advertising and   
Remarketing

| 

These cookies are used to understand and deliver ads, make them more relevant to you, and analyze the effectiveness of our programs such as employee recruiting campaigns. They may use the fact that you visited our Sites to target online ads for Boeing services to you on non-Boeing websites. Some of these cookies may be placed on your device by a third party with which we contract to provide certain services. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not impact Site functionality. For details and to opt out, see section “Do we participate in interest-based advertising?”.  
  
Social Features

| 

These cookies allow you to more easily share our Site content on social networks, or share your comments with other Site visitors. Some of these cookies may be placed on your device by a third party with which we contract to provide certain services. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not impact Site functionality. For details and to opt out, see section “Do third parties use cookies or tracers on our Sites?”.  
  
Security and   
Authentication

| 

These cookies are used to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and protect user data from unauthorized parties. Without these cookies, certain Sites features cannot function properly.  
  
**Do third parties use cookies or tracers on our Sites?  
**Boeing Sites often contain cookies or similar technologies from third-party providers, which help us compile statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, perform analytics, enable social networking features such as sharing Boeing content or leaving Site comments, and other operations. These technologies enable the third-party providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across the Sites and other, unaffiliated devices, applications, websites or services. You can opt out of data collection or use by some of these third-party providers by clicking the following links:

  * <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>
  * <http://www-01.ibm.com/software/marketing-solutions/privacy/index.html>
  * <http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html>
  * <http://www.addthis.com/privacy/opt-out>****
  * <https://www.scorecardresearch.com/optout.aspx>****



**Do we participate in interest-based advertising?**  
Boeing may also enable cookies and third-party tracking mechanisms to collect your information for use in interest-based advertising. For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited our Sites to target online ads for Boeing services to you on non-Boeing websites. In addition, our third-party advertising networks might use information about your use of our Sites to help target non-Boeing advertisements based on your online behavior in general. You can learn more about interest-based advertising, or opt out of the practice, by clicking the following links:

  * <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices>  
  * <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>
  * <https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin>



You can opt out of interest-based advertising in mobile apps by downloading the Digital Advertising Alliance’s AppChoices tool at the following link:

  * <https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices>****



**Do we use cross-device tracking?**  
Data collected from a particular browser, app or device may be used with another computer or device that is linked to the browser, app or device on which such data was collected. For example, we or our third-party service providers may display an ad to you on your laptop based on the fact that you visited Boeing Sites on your smartphone. You can opt out of cross-device tracking on each of your browsers and devices by using the links provided above (see “Do we participate in interest-based advertising?”). Please note that the opt-out will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out, and you will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices.

**Do we collect and use personal information?**  
In some cases, Boeing requests personal information from you, and in other cases we get it by noting how you interact with our Sites. Examples of personal information include name, phone number, e-mail address, and mailing address. Boeing may use your personal information in a variety of ways, including:

  * To fulfill underlying transactions on our Sites;
  * To satisfy the purpose of your accessing the Sites;
  * To respond to your questions or requests concerning the Sites;
  * To deliver confirmations, account information, notifications, and similar operational communications;
  * To improve your user experience and the quality of our Sites;
  * To comply with legal and/or regulatory requirements; and
  * To manage our business.



We and our partners also may use the information you provide to send you future communications (including, for example, promotional messages) about Boeing and issues of interest via email, postal mail, fax, SMS and phone as permitted by local law. Although we hope you will find our promotional communications of interest, you may opt out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each message. Please note that we do not consider aggregated information, from which identifiers have been removed, to be personal information.

We will provide you with access to your personal information that we hold for any purpose within practical and legal limits. This includes requests that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Boeing is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made by emailing us [here](mailto:globalprivacy@boeing.com).

We may combine personal information collected through our Sites with other information that we or third parties collect about you in other contexts such as our communications with you via email or phone, or your customer service records. We will treat such combined information as personal information and protect it in accordance with this Policy.

**Do we collect and use location data?**   
When you use Boeing Sites, we may, after obtaining consent as required by local law, collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide us with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. Location data is used in accordance with the section “Do we collect and use personal information?”, and disclosed in accordance with the section “When would we disclose your information?”.

**What security is provided?**  
Boeing uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion. However, no security program is foolproof, and thus we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal or other information.

**When would we disclose your information?**  
Certain Boeing Sites may disclose information to third parties assisting us in processing a transaction requested by you (e.g., credit card service providers). In addition, we may disclose personal information to contractors and service providers acting on our behalf for the purposes identified above (see “Do we collect and use personal information?”), including to send promotional communications to you via email, postal mail, fax, SMS and phone as permitted by local law. In order to cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas, or court orders, to protect Boeing and/or Boeing's systems and customers, to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or to ensure the integrity and operation of Boeing and/or Boeing's business and systems, Boeing may access and disclose any information it considers necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.

**What about children's privacy?**  
Boeing does not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information from children under 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction. If you believe that we have collected personal information about a child under 13, please inform us by email [here](mailto:globalprivacy@boeing.com) so that we may delete the information. Additionally, please use this same email address to request removal of content or information that was posted to our Sites when the registered user was under the age of 18.

**What if data is transmitted internationally?**  
If you are one of our international visitors, we realize that you may want to know whether your personal information will be transferred out of your country of origin. Please be aware that when you register or request a transaction on Boeing Sites, we reserve the right to transfer your personal data to computers in the United States or any other country where Boeing or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. The data protection laws in these countries may be different from, and less stringent than, those in your country of residence. By using the Sites or by providing any personal or other information to us, you expressly consent to such transfer and processing. We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this Policy is processed according to the provisions of this Policy and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.

**Does this Policy apply to all Boeing Sites?**  
This Policy applies to visitors of Boeing Sites that link to this Policy. Individual Boeing Sites may adopt different privacy policies that fit transactions taking place on those Boeing Sites. If a Boeing Site has its own privacy policy, the provisions of that policy will take priority if it conflicts with this Policy.

**What about external links?**  
For the convenience of our Site visitors, Boeing may provide links to third party websites that are external to Boeing. These websites are not operated or controlled by Boeing, and Boeing is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such external websites.

**How do we approach privacy for mobile applications?**  
This section of the Policy describes our practices related to the collection, use, disclosure of, and user control over, personal and location information we collect from or about you in the course of providing services through our mobile applications (“Apps”).

Collection: After download, our Apps may solicit information from you such as login credentials. Logging in generally allows access to account information and App features. You may at times be given the option to enter personal information while using certain features of our Apps. Some of the information you enter may include first and last name, phone number, email, mailing address, passport or government ID (number, country of issue, expiration date), gender, date of birth, and country of residence.

Use & Retention: We use the information about you and your device (including location data) collected through our Apps, as well as other information obtained from our website or network, your device and account for several purposes. These include to maintain and provide you with the services, to respond to your questions and instructions, to maintain the integrity of our network and address security issues, to investigate or take action regarding violations or suspected violations of law or our terms, and to improve Boeing products and services. Boeing will store your personal information for as long as you use the App, and no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected or for which it is legitimately further processed.

Disclosure: Boeing will share your personal information as indicated in the section “When would we disclose your information?”.

User Control: Access, correction, or deletion requests for your personal information can be made by emailing us [here](mailto:globalprivacy@boeing.com).

Location Information: If you have first provided permission through your device, Boeing may obtain pinpointed physical location information from technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower proximity. You are able to withdraw your permission for Boeing to acquire pinpointed location information from your device through your device settings, although Boeing does not control this process. Boeing Apps use the geo-location features (GPS or network-based) to support your use of location-based tools such as airport/map views, city code searches and other features, as-well-as to improve Boeing Apps.

**What happens to my data if Boeing reorganizes?**  
In the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock, Boeing is likely to disclose your personal information to the new owners, subject to a requirement that such information be used only in accordance with this Policy.

**How do we handle Boeing employee information?**  
This section describes Boeing’s collection, use, and disclosure of employees’ personal information in non-employment contexts, such as when using optional and/or public Boeing Sites. This section will apply to a Site if linked directly from there; otherwise, our internal privacy policies will apply. Some of our Sites that provide employee and retiree information may provide different policies, in which case they take priority.

We may collect and use your personal information as described by this Policy in section “Do we collect and use personal information?” and disclose your information as described in section “When would we disclose your information?”. Access, correction, or deletion requests for your personal information can be made by emailing us [here](mailto:globalprivacy@boeing.com).

**How do we keep current?**  
From time to time, Boeing may revise this Policy at its discretion. We note the effective date of the Policy below, so you know when it was last updated. Boeing advises you to check back periodically to review the Policy because users of our Sites will be prospectively bound by the then-current version of this Policy.  
Effective Date: May 19, 2016
