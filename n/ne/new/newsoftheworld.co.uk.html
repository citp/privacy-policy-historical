            <p class="black10"> Our websites may contain links to other websites, 
              and you should be aware that we are clearly not responsible for 
              the privacy practices on other sites. </p>
            <p class="black10"> We recommend that you individually check the 
              privacy statements of each and every other website that you visit.

              Groups</b> </span></p>
            <p class="black10"> We always aim to improve the services we offer. 
              As a result we occasionally canvass our customers using surveys. 
            </p>
            <p class="black10"> Participation in surveys is voluntary, and you 
              are under no obligation to reply to any survey you might receive 
              from us. </p>
            <p class="black10"> Should you choose to do so, we will treat the 
              information you provide with the same high standard of care as all 
              other customer information. </p>
            <p class="black10"> From time to time, we ask customers whether they 
              wish to participate in User Groups, often to assist us in the development 
              of new features, services or sites. </p>
            <p class="black10"> Participation in User Groups is voluntary, and 
              you are under no obligation to join any User Group. Should you choose 
              to join a User Group, however, we will treat the information you 
              provide with the same high standard of care as all other customer 
              information. </p>
            <p> <span class="black10"><b class="blackbold18">Contests</b> </span></p>
            <p class="black10"> Your participation on our sites may mean that 
              we occasionally contact you with the opportunity to enter competitions. 
              Entry to competitions is voluntary, and you are under no obligation 
              to take up an invitation from us to enter. </p>
            <p class="black10"> Should you choose to enter a competition, we 
              will treat the information you provide with the same high standard 
              of care as all other customer information, and use the information 
              provided strictly within the entry terms of the competition and 
              this Privacy Statement. </p>

            <p class="black10"> We may from time to time operate a "Tell a friend" 
              service. This is a referral service, designed to make it easy for 
              customers to recommend our websites or offers to a friend, and is 
              a two-step process. </p>
            <p class="black10"> First, a customer sends us the friend's name 
              and email address, and secondly, we contact the friend, telling 
              them who we are, and inviting them to take advantage of a particular 
              offer, or to visit our website. </p>
            <p class="black10"> When we contact your friend, we always advise 
              them of the name and email address of the friend who made the original 
              referral. We will not use your friend's details for any other purpose.
