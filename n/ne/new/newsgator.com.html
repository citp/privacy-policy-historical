				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<h5>Our Commitment To Privacy</h5>
				<p>
					Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this 
					notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make 
					about the way your information is collected and used.
				</p>
				<p>We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of web sites to 
					which we may link.</p>
				<h5>The Information We Collect</h5>
				<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the 
					NewsGator.com website. On some pages, you can order products, and register to 
					use our forums. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:</p>
				<p>Name<br>
					Address<br>
					Email address<br>
					Phone number<br>
					Credit Card Information</p>
				<h5>The Way We Use Information</h5>
				<p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to 
					complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties 
					except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
				</p>
				<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are 
					not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
				</p>
				<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website 
					and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X 
					number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not 
					disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
				</p>
				<p>We do not currently use our database of customer information directly for 
					marketing purposes; should this policy change in the future, you will have the 
					opportunity to opt-out of any such marketing communication.
				</p>
				<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided 
					to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also 
					providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated 
					uses.
				</p>
				<h5>Use of Cookies
				</h5>
				<p>We use session cookies (cookies which are only used for a single session) during 
					the ordering process, and in the NewsGator forums.
				</p>
				<p>We use persistent cookies (cookies which will are stored on your computer and 
					used for multiple sessions) only if you choose to use the auto-login feature of 
					the NewsGator forums.
				</p>
				<h5>Our Commitment To Data Security
				</h5>
				<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct 
					use of information, we have put in place appropriate procedures to safeguard 
					and secure the information we collect online. All personal information is 
					transmitted in encrypted format using SSL, and individual credit card 
					information is not stored on our systems at any time after the completion of an 
					order.
				</p>
				<h5>How To Contact Us
				</h5>
				<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please 
					send us email at <a href="mailto:info@newsgator.com">info@newsgator.com</a>.
