<p><strong>a. Identifiers and Cookies.</strong></p>

<p>A cookie is a small piece of information that is stored on a computer for the purpose of identifying that browser during interaction on websites. Cookies may be used to store items such as identifiers and user preferences. A website may set a cookie to the browser if the browser's preferences allow it. A browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has set, not those set by other websites.</p>

<p>When a consumer responds to or views an Internet advertisement served by New Ship In (such as through third-party Web sites or email solicitation) or visits the New Ship In site, a Cookie and/or gif file is sent to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the end user's Internet browser.</p>

<p>These Cookies provide New Ship In with information for the purpose of paying third-parties commissions when an Internet user clicks on a link, creates a lead, or makes a purchase on an advertiser's Web site. If the Internet user re-visits the advertiser's site directly, New Ship In may continue to track the user's activities (excluding PII) on the advertiser's site and reward the third-party Web site that referred the user. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as to determine the frequency of display.</p>

<p>New Ship In may use cookies for a number of purposes, including to:</p>

<p>Access your information when you sign in so we can provide you with customized content.</p>

<p>Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using New Ship In.</p>

<p>Control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement. We also may use Internet browsing and online purchase data associated with an anonymous identifier to develop a predictive statistical user profile of the end user's needs and interests.</p>

<p>Optimize and personalize your experience and allow New Ship In to monitor log-ins and site traffic patterns. We record the IP address of members at each login, and this information is part of a secure database and is password protected.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to retain all ad delivery and reporting data as long as New Ship In finds it is reasonably necessary for accounting and audit purposes.</p>

<p><strong>b. Limitation on Liability.</strong></p>

<p>New Ship In expressly disclaims any obligation or liability to any user of any Video's website of any nature, including with regard to any data about that user that New Ship In obtains, processes, stores, uses or discloses.</p>

<p><strong>c. No Information Collected from Children.</strong></p>

<p>New Ship In<strong> will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If </strong>New Ship In<strong> obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, </strong>New Ship In<strong> has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. </strong>New Ship In<strong> has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).</strong></p>


<p>We believe it is important to provide added protection for children online. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate in and monitor their online activity.&nbsp; If a parent or guardian believes that New Ship In has in its database the personally-identifiable information of a child under the age of 13, please contact&nbsp;us&nbsp;and we will use our best efforts to remove the information from our records.</p>
