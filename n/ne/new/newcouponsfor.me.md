### Who We Are

We are a provider of performance marketing technology used by marketers in industries including education, financial services, insurance, retail and lifestyle services. 

### Information We Collect

To provide advertisement that we believe may be useful to you, we collect information about your online activities, including your browsing history, information about which advertisements or web pages you viewed, clicked, or interacted with. You may be required to provide personally identifiable information to access or use parts of our Website. Personally identifiable information includes name, address, telephone number, email address, and any other data used or intended to be used to identify, contact or locate you. In addition, we may ask for certain sensitive consumer information which includes social security number to obtain additional information about you such as your credit score and/or your credit report to improve our matching service for you. If you do not provide the requested personally identifiable information, you may not be able to access or use the features of the Website. We may also ask for information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services; education level; educational interests; home owner status; income; debt level; current mortgage balance; mortgage rate and the like and other information that does not identify you. Cookies

When you visit our Site, we may collect certain information through the use of cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer. In addition to storing your preferences and other information, the cookies allow us to gather information about your interactions within our Site and/or on a given advertisement. We use both session cookies, which terminate when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on your computer until you manually delete them. You may decline our cookies if your web browser software permits. If you choose to accept cookies, you may choose to delete them later. You may access the "Help" option on your web browser's menu bar to instruct you on how to delete cookies.

Through the use of cookies, we collect information arising out of your use of our Site. When you visit our Site, we track certain non-personally identifiable information with respect to your activity on the Site. Your cookie information could consist of: the time of day an advertisement is displayed, an advertisement id that shows which advertisements you have clicked on, your IP address that shows your general geographic location and the referral id that shows the URL of the web page where you clicked on the ad, and/or other actions you conduct while on our Site. The cookies that we use will be set for 3 years.

We may use information we collect from cookies with any non-personally identifiable information that you provide to us as well as with your interaction with the Sites. The aforementioned information cannot, by itself, be used to gather any personally identifiable information about you. Third parties may also set cookies on or through the service to track Site usage and to track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns. We may combine cookie information with your personally identifiable information with your consent. 

### Log Files

When you visit our Website, we track IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp and number of clicks to analyze trends and administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather demographic information. We use your IP address at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather technical and demographic information on who uses the Site. 

### Web Beacons

We may use standard internet technology, called Web Beacons (also called clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) that are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track online movements. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer, a web beacon is embedded invisibly on a webpage (or email). Web beacons help us better manage content through the service by informing us and our third party partners what content and which campaigns are effective and to gauge the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by showing how many emails the recipients have opened or by sending/receiving an identification number when you travel to a site from an online advertisement. We do not tie web beacons to personally identifiable information without your opt in consent. 

### How We Use Your Information

In order to customize your experience, we show you advertisement(s) which we believe may be of interest to you based on the information we collect and our inferences from this information. The inferences may be based on several factors such as your cookie information, web beacon information, and any information that you provide or a combination of these with your opt in consent. We will not combine previously collected non-personally identifiable information with your personally identifiable information without your opt in consent. Similarly, we will not collect any sensitive consumer information such as social security numbers or financial account numbers without your opt in consent.

Based upon your affirmative opt in consent, as evidenced by your clicking on the applicable "submit" button, acknowledgement box, your registration on a Site, your submission of the requested information, including your personally identifiable information, we may use the information you provide to attempt to match you with providers of products and services and/or we may forward the information that you provided directly to our third party partners.

General: In general we may use information we collect about you to: 

  * Provide the products and services that you have requested;
  * Perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in our products, services, content, or the products, services, or content offered by third parties;
  * Communicate with you via email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or third parties;
  * Develop and display content and advertisement tailored to your interests on our site and other sites;
  * Verify your eligibility to receive products and/or services;
  * Enforce our Terms of Service;
  * Manage our business; and
  * Perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.



For example, we may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions, and accuracy; compare your information against publicly available files or commercially available data; and/or validate personal information to verify that the information you submitted has a high probability of being valid information. Use for Research: We may collect information about you and store it in connection with other online and/or offline information we may possess or obtain about you to create a general user profile.

### Email and Telephone Calls

From time to time, we or our business partners may contact you via e-mail advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, or other means to inform you of additional opportunities for other services and/or products that we believe may be of interest to you, even if you are listed on any federal, state or other applicable "Do Not Call" list. You are under no obligation to accept any service or product offered through these communications. We may maintain separate e-mail, mailing or phone lists for different purposes based on the information that you submitted and that we maintain. 

### Financial Information

To the extent that you provide your credit card information, we will use the information to verify your identity and/or for transmitting the information to the third party partners authorized by you for the purpose of completing your transaction. Such verification may be conducted through a third-party service provider and, in that case, we would share your specific credit card information with this third-party provider for verification purposes. Your credit card information will be encrypted during transmission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may share with third-parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific users.

In the event we offer product and/or services where your credit card information is required to process your requested transaction, we will store your credit card information to facilitate your authorized transactions. Your credit card information is stored for a maximum of seven days. 

## Sharing your Information

### Third parties

WE MAY USE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE, INCLUDING SELLING OR TRANSFERRING SUCH INFORMATION AT ANY TIME TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE. For example, we may share your personal information with third party partners so that they can contact you and offer you products and/or services that we and they believe might be of interest to you. This may include, but is not limited to, e-mail advertising, telephone marketing, and direct mail marketing. By providing personal information when using the Sites, you are entering into a business relationship with Recess's third party partners and are requesting, and expressly consenting to, being contacted by our third party partners via telephone, fax, email, surface mail or any other means, at any of your contact numbers or addresses, even if you are listed on any federal, state or other applicable "Do Not Call" list, in order to provide the services set forth on the Site or for other purposes reasonably related to your expressed interest in the service and/or product request and the business of our third party partners, including marketing-related emails.

PLEASE NOTE: submission of YOUR telephone number(s) is YOUR authorization and request to be called at the telephone number(s) YOU provide.

We will fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal purposes. 

## How We Protect Your Privacy

### Security Measures

In order to protect both the personal information and the general information that we receive from you through our website, we have implemented various security measures. As an initial matter, any financial information (i.e. credit card information) transmitted to our servers via a secure server is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology. SSL is a protocol that transmits your communications over the Internet in an encrypted form. The protocol ensures that the information is sent, unchanged, only to the server you intended to send it to.

Once your Financial Information reaches our server, it is protected by a firewall. In addition to encryption and firewall protections, our third party partners are required to operate in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations. If we learn that any of our third party partners is breaching our agreement, we will take corrective actions including, if necessary, terminate our relationship with such third party partner. 

### Risk of Interception

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept personal data or access our servers and obtain personal data. By using this site, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we do not guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through this site and that any personal information, or other data or information received from you through the site is provided to us at your own risk, which you expressly assume. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can mail us at the address indicated below in the Contact Us section.

Thereafter, you should not receive any further email offers containing advertisements and promotions from this Site. However you may still receive promotional communications from our third party partners with whom we have shared your information. To stop receiving further communications from these third party partners you will need to contact them directly in order to opt-out. Please note that after we process your request to opt-out from receiving additional email offers, advertisements and/or promotions from this Site, we will no longer make your information available to our third party partners relating to this Site.
