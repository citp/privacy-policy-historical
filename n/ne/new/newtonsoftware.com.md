# Applicant Privacy Policy | Newton Software

We are Newton Software, Inc., an Ohio corporation (“Newton”), the owner and operator of the job applicant tracking software system called Newton (the “Application”) (found at [newtonsoftware.com](http://www.newtonsoftware.com/); the “Website”). The Application is used by companies to post job openings, collect potential job applicant information and track applicants through the hiring process.

The Application is accessed and used by two distinctly different types of users: companies that post job openings on the Application and review candidates who apply for those job openings (“Corporate Users”); and candidates for those job openings who use the Application to apply for them (“Applicants”). This Newton Applicant Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is intended solely for Applicants (“you”).

As a part of Newton’s mission to provide you effective Application services, Newton collects, stores and discloses information you provide on the Application under specific conditions. Your Personal Information (as defined in Section 2.1) is private and confidential, and subject to this Policy, meaning that such information will not be collected, stored or disclosed unless permitted under this Policy. This Policy describes what information Newton collects, how it is used and secured, and when and to whom it may be disclosed. Please take a few minutes to review this Policy.

### 1\. Consent

Your use of the Application is deemed to be your waiver and consent to this Policy and providing Newton and designated third-parties under this Policy the right to collect, use and disclose your Personal Information (as defined in Section 2.1) subject to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not consent to the terms and conditions of this Policy, you should not use the Application.

### 2\. Personal Information

#### 2.1 Covered Information.

Newton and designated third-parties under this Policy may collect, store and disclose the following forms of information you provide on the Application (collectively, the “Personal Information”): (a) e-mail addresses; (b) job application information, including without limitation, your employment history, answers to job application questions and any other requested information; (c) device identification information; (d) preferred language and country information; (e) correspondence or communication sent via the Application; (f) information on your interactions with Application features or other Application users; and (g) other reasonably relevant information pertaining to your use of the Application including without limitation your Internet protocol addresses, standard web log information and content provided to Newton or their designated third-parties when contacted for assistance.

#### 2.2 Your Informational Obligations.

Newton requires that you only submit information on the Application that is up-to-date and accurate, and that you inform Newton of any changes to such information. You must also assure that such information, whether provided on behalf of yourself or others, is correct and that you have the full authority and right to submit such information to the Application.

#### 2.3 Personal Choices.

Newton acknowledges the individual’s right to access their personal data. If you want to review or update your Personal Information, you may do so on the Application by visiting your Personal Profile. If you have any questions regarding access to or updating of your Personal Information, please contact us at [support@newtonsoftware.com](mailto:support@newtonsoftware.com).

### 3\. Ownership of Personal Information

Newton does not own the information or data you enter into the Application. Any information or data you enter into the Application becomes the property of the Corporate Users to whom you submit job applications via the Application. What such Corporate Users choose to do with such information is solely in their own discretion. If you have concerns about the collection, use or disclosure of your information, please do not use the Application or, in alternative, contact the identified Corporate User.

### 4\. Cookies

#### 4.1 Assignment of Cookies.

When you click a job opening link on the Application or apply to a job opening posted on the Application by using the Application, Newton will assign you a unique identifier and send such information to your computer or device hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is used to assist you in the job application process on the Application and to prevent the duplicate submission of your information to the same job opening. The Application may also use a cookie in order to identify the job-posting site or individual that referred you to the job opening on the Application.

#### 4.2 Disabling Cookies.

If you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at anytime by modifying your Internet browser’s settings. However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of Application’s features and you may not be able to apply for jobs that are posted by the Application.

### 5\. Use of Your Information

#### 5.1 Use of Personal Information.

Newton uses your Personal Information to: (a) offer the Application’s services or conduct Newton’s business operations; (b) resolve disputes, or troubleshoot problems related to any services or products offered or provided through the Application; (c) encourage safe interactions between Application users; (d) enforce this Policy and others agreements associated with the Application or Website; (e) customize, measure and improve the Application and Website’s user experience; (f) contact you regarding the Application or your inquiries pertaining to the same; and (g) perform other related services for you as described in this Policy.

#### 5.2 Use of Information Upon Applying to Job Openings.

When you use the Application to apply for a job opening posted on the Application, Newton will provide the Corporate User to whom you applied for a job all of the information included in your job application (collectively “Job Application Information”). Under these circumstances, Newton is simply an intermediary that is assisting you in sharing your Job Application Information with the identified Corporate User. Such Corporate User will retain your Job Application Information subject to their own policies and terms of use. Newton has no rights or control over your Job Application Information once it is submitted to such Corporate User.
