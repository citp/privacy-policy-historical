Toronto Drug Store site may contain links to other websites not operated by Toronto Drug Store. These links are provided as a convenience and do not constitute an affiliation with, endorsement or sponsorship of the third parties that operate those websites. Toronto Drug Store is not responsible for the availability or reliability of the content of these third party websites.

## How We Keep Your Information Secure

We use state-of-the-art security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Specifically, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for the areas of our site where we ask you to provide personally identifiable information. SSL technology provides for the safe transmission of personal information you give us because the information is encrypted. Encryption involves systematically scrambling numbers and letters so that if someone managed to intercept a packet of information, they would not be able to make sense of it. Although encryption slows the process of sending information across the Internet, it does provide better protection for your information.

You can tell you have entered a secured area when you look at the Universal Resource Locator (URL) in your browser’s address bar and see that it has «https://» before the rest of the Web address. The «s» means that the page is hosted from a secured server. We use secured servers for our Order processing pages, and special promotions. Unsecured pages have URLs that begin with «http://» (without the «s»). Most of our shopping aisles and health information areas are hosted from servers that do not use SSL. Since we do not collect personal information in these areas, using regular servers ensures a faster browsing experience.

You may on occasion encounter a standard warning that many browsers display when a visitor moves from a «secured» page to an «unsecured» page. When you encounter such a warning on our Web site, it usually means that you are moving from an «https://» to an «http://» page. If you see other browser warnings or error messages concerning the security of our site, please Contact Us. Include the specific wording you saw and where at Toronto Drug Store you encountered the message. Providing us with these details helps us to know if you have encountered a technical difficulty or a standard warning like the one described above.

If you use this site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access information and password and for restricting access to your computer and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your password.

  


## Cookies

Like many other websites, we also collect information about site traffic and usage patterns through the use of cookies and Web server logs. Cookies are small computer files we transfer to your computer’s hard drive. These small text files help us personalize content on our pages and provide programs like e-coupons. Your browser software can be set to reject or accept cookies. Instructions for resetting the browser are available in the Help section of most browsers.

Our use of cookies also allows us to collect and retain certain information about a website user, such as the type of Web browser used by our customer. This information is not linked to personally identifiable information about a particular individual or customer account, but it is collected from a particular computer as the user moves through a website.

Reviewing our Web server logs and our customers’ use of our site helps us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose. Only authorized Toronto Drug Store personnel have access to the Web server logs, cookie utilization data, and purchase history information collected by us. These employees are held to strict confidentiality and security policies and procedures.

  


## Spyware

Spyware is a data collection technology that is downloaded to a consumer’s personal computer which aids in gathering information about that person or organization without their knowledge. It can enter your computer as a software virus or as a result of installing a new program. It is used to gather information about your personal internet usage, monitor keyboard strokes or capture personal information for use by other parties.

Toronto Drug Store does not install any tracking software or spyware on your system, or collect personal information about you and your browsing habits. Any personally identifiable information gathered about users is with the consent of the user, and all possible uses for the data are outlined at the time the data is provided. We take the security of your personal information seriously, and work hard to maintain a safe and secure site for your use.

  


## Your Consent

We hope you’ll agree to let us contact you with timely promotional offers. You can take yourself off our email list for promotional offers at any time by contacting us using Customer Support Ticket System.

You can request the removal or modification of your Personal Information by sending an email to the appropriate area under «Contact Us». You may also request that we not disclose your information. We will respond to accommodate your request in 30 days. It would be helpful to let us know the context in which you provided Personal Information.
