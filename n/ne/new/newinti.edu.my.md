# Privacy Policy | INTI International University

The **INTI** Education Group recognises that data protection and privacy are important issues, particularly with regard to the World Wide Web; consequently we take your personal privacy very seriously. The Privacy Policy gives an overview of what information is collected when you access our website and how certain information might be used.

We adhere to the principle of data protection and privacy and endeavour to implement it within the guidance of current legislation.

**Accessing the **INTI** Education Group’s website**

As a general rule, the **INTI** Education Group’s website employs the notion of ‘public access’ and does not require you to log in. Consequently, when you access the website, you are not required to submit any personal information; however, as it is common with most websites, certain anonymous data is gathered. For each visitor, our web server collects usage data; similarly, we use certain analytics systems to provide additional anonymised statistics – the type of information obtained might include: the number of page visits per week, the average number of pages viewed by users, domain names (e.g. .com, .ac.uk, .net), referring sites (e.g. Google.com, Yahoo.com), browser summaries (e.g. the number of visitors using Microsoft Internet Explorer or Firefox) and Operating System reports (e.g. the number of page requests made using Windows XP, Windows Vista, [Mac] OS X or Unix).

On occasion summary statistics may be disclosed to third parties; however, it is important to understand that the data doesn’t provide any personal information (e.g. email addresses) and isn’t attributed to individuals. The primary purpose for collecting the information, which is used on an aggregate basis, is to improve the content and functionality of our website.

*Note: This data is protected from public access and can only be viewed and disclosed by authorised personnel.

**Web Forms**

Where Web Forms are utilised on the site, users are usually required to supply some sort of personal information; in certain instances this might only be a reply email address; however, elsewhere, considerably more detailed information may be required, e.g. in the “Stand a chance to win an iPad” contest. In general, forms on the **INTI** Education Group’s website will either contain an explanation of how the information you supply will be used or will provide a link to this page (Data Protection – see below)

**Data Protection**

The information you provide to the **INTI** Education Group will be processed in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act (1998) and any other relevant legislation. This data may be used to provide you with further information about relevant services. It may be held on a mailing list or database for this purpose, unless you object (by notifying the University in writing); and it may also be passed on to a third party (a ‘data processor’) with whom the University has formally contracted to process your data for this purpose, subject to the safeguards concerning privacy and security of data set out in the Act.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small data structures used by a website to ‘request’ information from a client (usually a web browser), return the information to the web site and then store the information. There are various instances where the **INTI** Education Group’s website requires the use of Cookies, e.g. in the “Stand a chance to win an iPad” contest.

**Student-to-Student Network(s)**

In certain instances the **INTI** Education Group’s website facilitates communication between students (and staff) via online networks. Through these facilities personal information (e.g. an email address) might be made available to other students (and staff). The networks primarily operate on an ‘opt-in’ basis, i.e. you have to request that your details are added to the network and consent to their inclusion. It should be noted, however, that staff at the **INTI** Education Group don’t generally monitor such services, and consequently, the INTI Education Group doesn’t accept responsibility for any information or other material transmitted using a particular service. Similarly, the views expressed by students using these (or similar) networks do not reflect the views of the **INTI** Education Group.

If you have access to the Student Portal and/or a VLE, then please read the statements relevant to these systems.

**Third-Party Links and information**

The **INTI** Education Group’s website has links to third-party websites and information. While links and information are only added if they are perceived to be of relevance to our website users, the **INTI** Education Group does not accept responsibility for their content.
