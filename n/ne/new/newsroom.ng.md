# Privacy | Newsroom

_Last Updated on October 15, 2014_

This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for Newsroom Nigeria and [newsroom.ng](http://http//newsroom.ng/) (including any other applications collectively referred to as the “Newsroom Nigeria”), and to any services that display this notice.

The Newsroom Nigeria Services may contain links to other websites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites.

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?**

The information gathered when you interact with the Newsroom Nigeria falls into two categories: 1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our sites, enter a contest or provide your email address and 2) Non-personal information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected by us as well as third parties.

**_Personal Information That You Give Us_**

**Registration Information**

Registration for the Newsroom Nigeria may require that you supply certain personal information, including a unique email address and demographic information (ZIP code, age, sex, household income, job industry and job title) to register.

You may choose to log in, create an account or enhance your profile at Newsroom Nigeria through the Facebook Connect feature on Newsroom Nigeria. By doing this, you are asking Facebook to send us certain information from your Facebook profile, and you authorize us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information available to us through the Facebook interface. After you have connected, Facebook also sends us additional information from your profile that allows us to display a Facebook module on the pages you view.

To disassociate your [newsroom.ng](http://newsroom.ng/) registration from third party accounts, including Facebook, please see our Social Media FAQ.

**Billing and Credit Card Information**

To enable payment and donations via the Newsroom Nigeria Services, we collect and store name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and other billing information. This information will only be shared with third parties who help to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.

**User Generated Content and Public Activities (Including Comments, Reader Reviews and TimesPeople)**

We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on [newsroom.ng](http://newsroom.ng/) and other Newsroom Nigeria Services. “Public activities” are any actions you take on [newsroom.ng](http://newsroom.ng/) that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reader reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by The Newsroom Nigeria for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected and used by other users of these areas.

We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in the course of your public activities and we have no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your public activities or submissions. For more information, see the Comments FAQ and read the Forums, Discussions and User

Generated Content section of the Terms of Service.

If you have registered for a [newsroom.ng](http://newsroom.ng/) account, we will track and aggregate your public activities on [newsroom.ng](http://newsroom.ng/). By choosing to participate in public activities, you are electing to share and display such public activities via newsroom.ng. Also, public activities may be included in RSS feeds, APIs and made available to other websites via other formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds. Keep in mind that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your public activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not Newsroom Nigeria.

When you share or recommend (with or without adding your own comments) any Newsroom Nigeria articles or content to your Facebook profile, that action is governed by the Facebook Privacy Policy. We do not record those comments.

**Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers**

The Newsroom Nigeria collects personal information from you when you participate in sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is also being collected by a third party other than Newsroom Nigeria, we will notify you at the same time. If you do not want any personal information shared, you should not participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.

**Reader Surveys and Market Research**

The Newsroom Nigeria may collect personal information from you in connection with voluntary surveys conducted via the Newsroom Nigeria website. Data may be collected through the Newsroom Nigeria, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.

**Conferences and Live Events**

We often receive information about attendees to our live events from sign-in and registration lists. We may share this information with event or promotion sponsors, in which case we will notify you when we collect the information.

_**Non-Personal Information Collected Using Technology**_

**Information Collected by Us Using Technology**

You will not be able to access certain areas of our websites, including [newsroom.ng](http://newsroom.ng/), if your computer does not accept cookies from us. We do not respond to browser-based “do not track” signals. For more detailed information about our use of cookies and local storage, and how to manage them, see Frequently Asked Questions About Cookies and Similar Technologies in our Help section.

The Newsroom Nigeria Services may transmit non-personally identifiable website usage information about our visitors to a reputable third party in order to show you advertising for Newsroom Nigeria when you visit other sites.

**Location Information.** Some of our mobile applications can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature of the app. If you enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the app. If you elect to have a location-

based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an app does not have that feature, the app will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information.

Ads may be displayed within our apps. The ads you see are not targeted to you based on your current GPS location, but they may be targeted to you based on your device’s IP address or ZIP code.

**Information Collected by Third Parties**

Some of the services and advertisements included in the Newsroom Nigeria, including on newsroom.ng and within our mobile apps, are delivered or served by third-party companies. These companies may place or recognize cookies, Web beacons or other technology to track certain non-personal information about our website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the Newsroom Nigeria. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.

We do not have access to, nor control over, advertisers’ or service providers’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.

Google serves advertisements onto [newsroom.ng](http://newsroom.ng/). It uses the DART cookie to serve ads based on your visit to newsroom.ng and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
