	<h4>ABOUT US</h4>



<h2>Newsday.com Privacy Policy</h2>






	





<p>
	
	<strong>newsday.com</strong> strives to offer its visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and
personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable
Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone
number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. Please note
this policy applies only to information collected by newsday.com
online and does not impact information collected or used by
newsday.com or its affiliates through other means. <br>
<br>
 

</p><p><strong>How we gather information from users.</strong></p>

<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are
visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the
services provided. You can visit many pages on our site without
providing any information. Other pages may prompt you to provide
information, such as when you register for access to portions of
our site, sign up for membership, request certain features (e.g.,
newsletters, news updates and other products), sign up for a
newspaper subscription or make a purchase. You may also provide
information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests,
voting and polling activities, message boards and chat rooms and
other interactive areas of our site.<br>
<br>
 Like most Web sites, newsday.com also collects information
automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be
transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of
your Internet Service Provider or use “cookie”
technology. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name
and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information
each time you visit, or may control the number of times you
encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we
adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through
other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us
with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to
accept cookies, but doing so may limit your ability to access
certain portions of the site or may require you to re-enter your
user name and password. Additionally we may not be able to
customize the site’s features according to your
preferences.</p>

<p><strong>What we do with the information we collect.</strong></p>

<p>We will use your information only as permitted by law.
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally
identify you) may be used in many ways. As one example, we may
combine information about your usage patterns with similar
information obtained from other users to learn which pages are
visited most or what features are most attractive. Aggregated
Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and
business partners, but cannot be used to contact you
individually.</p>

<p>We also collect information to enhance your visit and deliver
more individualized content and advertising. For example, we may
use Personally Identifiable Information collected on newsday.com to
communicate with you regarding our <a href="http://www.newsday.com/about/ny-useragreement,0,7119248.htmlstory">Terms
of Service</a> and privacy policy, products and services offered by
newsday.com and other Tribune Company affiliates and partners,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, processing e-commerce
transactions and other topics we think you might find of interest.
We reserve the right to share this information with other Tribune
Company business units and affiliates, including for example our
affiliated newspapers and entities in which Tribune Company has an
ownership interest (collectively, “Affiliates”). This
policy does not apply to any Affiliate’s use of such
information.</p>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by newsday.com may
also be used for other purposes including but not limited to site
administration and troubleshooting. Certain third parties who
provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web
hosting service and our newsletter provider, for example) may
access such information.</p>

<p>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge
or partner with other companies or businesses. In such
transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
We may also disclose your information in response to a court order,
at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so
by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to
us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give
such information to law enforcement authorities. Please note we may
not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>

<p><strong>Your choice to opt out.</strong></p>

<p>The quality news and information on newsday.com is supported by
advertising revenue and a controlled program of e-mail marketing is
an important element of our online publishing business. Like other
Web publishers, we sometimes permit our advertising and promotional
partners to e-mail you about services, features, products, special
offers and unique content we believe might interest you. If you
prefer not to receive e-mail communications sent directly from our
advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an
opportunity to decline before you provide us information we might
use for this purpose. If you decline at the time you provide us
such information, we will not share the Personally Identifiable
Information you provide with non-Affiliated advertisers for such
purposes, though we may on occasion send you information on their
behalf.</p>

<p><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and
advertisements.</strong></p>

<p>newsday.com expects its partners, advertisers and third-party
affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. However, third
parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other
content providers accessible through our site, may have their own
privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example,
during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a
frame on a newsday.com page, certain content that is actually
created or hosted by a third party. Also, through newsday.com you
may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites,
advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other
parties. newsday.com is not responsible for the actions or policies
of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy
policies of those third parties when providing information on a
feature or page operated by a third party.</p>

<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or
other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt
to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about
you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third
parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to
determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.
Through features available on our site, third parties may use
cookies or other technology to gather information. newsday.com does
not control the use of this technology or the resulting information
and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third
parties.</p>

<p>A cookie gets entered by your Web browser into the "Cookies" folder on your hard drive after you close your browser, and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site.  We use persistent and session cookies to analyze and enhance your experience on the Site, and use third party ad technology to serve ads.   The data that is collected is the property of newsday.com, not the third party.  We also allow third parties called ad networks or ad servers to serve ads to you on newsday.com. Cookies enable them to compile information about where you, or others who have used your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on.   This information makes it possible for the ad technology, ad servers and ad networks to deliver targeted advertisements to you on newsday.com. Newsday.com does not have access to the cookies that may be placed on your computer by third-party ad technology, ad servers or ad networks. Newsday.com maintains relationships with a number of third-party networks, including Doubleclick, Unicast, and Pointroll.  Those parties that use cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting.  You may find more information at the Web site of the individual ad network or the 
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp"> Network Advertising Initiative.</a></p>

<p>Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
Should you choose to voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable
Information on our site, such as in message boards, chat areas or
in advertising or notices you post, that information can be viewed
publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our
knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other
individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the
control of newsday.com and this policy.</p>

<p><strong>Children.</strong></p>

<p>newsday.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally
Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as
permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information
from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete
that information immediately. If you believe newsday.com has any
information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the
address listed below.</p>
