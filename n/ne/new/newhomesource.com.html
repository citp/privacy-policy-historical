                COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
            </h3>
            <p>Information is collected from our users at several different points during your visit to BDX.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Registration</em>-- To use some resources available on our websites, a user must complete our registration process. During registration, a user is required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, address, e-mail address, a password, and phone number.</p>
            <p>
                <em>Optional Information</em>--At various other points during your visit to BDX, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. For example, you may wish to participate in a survey or a contest. Participation in surveys or contests or the use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our site.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Passive Collection of Information</em>-- In addition to the information which you actively provide to BDX by methods such as completing the registration form, BDX collects information about how you interact with our site. BDX collects passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience at the site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. The types of passive information collected by this site include, without limitation, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where you go on our site, and how long you stay on any part of our site. Passive information does not identify you to BDX by name, and BDX does not link your IP address to your personally identifiable information.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Collection of Information from Children</em>-- BDX abides by federal law and the guidelines set up by the Federal Trade Commission regarding youth privacy (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act). As such, BDX will not knowingly collect any personal information from or allow the registration of young people under the age of 13.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Tell-A-Friend</em>-- You can choose to let a friend or your parents know about BDX through our Tell-A-Friend referral services. If you choose to use the Tell-A-Friend service, we will ask you for your friend's name and e-mail address and BDX will send your friend an e-mail inviting him or her to visit BDX to learn more about our services. BDX stores your friend's contact information for the sole purpose of sending the e-mail.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>USE OF INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>
                The information which you supply to BDX enables us to provide the new home search and matching services, home brochures, maps, etc. In addition, BDX uses your information in order to customize our site to your interests and enhance your overall experience at our site. BDX tries to recognize you using various methods, including having you log in with your e-mail address and your password. Once BDX recognizes you, pages, advertisements and other content is customized for you so that you can see what interests you the most. In addition, as described above, BDX utilizes passive information to learn more about how you interact with our site. This passive information may be combined with your other information for purposes such as testing and improving your experience at our site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. This aggregate passive information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Contacting You by E-Mail</em>-- BDX may use your contact information periodically in order to send you e-mail regarding updates at the BDX site, such as new BDX opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you. The frequency of these messages will vary depending upon your profile. In addition, we may send you free informational newsletters or notices relating to topics which may be of special interest to you, including builders, product manufacturers, related advertisers and general home shopping advice. Finally, if you specifically provide BDX with permission at the time of registration, you may also receive commercial e-mails. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to opt-out of receiving newsletters and/or commercial e-mails whenever such messages are sent by BDX, as described below. E-mail messages from third parties are not governed by the opt-out provisions of this Privacy Policy, but all such third parties are strongly encouraged to include opt-out procedures in their messages to you.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>
                BDX will not knowingly sell, share, rent or otherwise transfer your information other than in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the registration process, and at certain points thereafter in connection
                with specific offers, BDX asks you whether information about you may be sent to
                third parties who have products, services and opportunities which may be useful
                to you. BDX understands how important your information is to you. Therefore, BDX
                does not share any information that can be tied to you without your permission.
                If you give your permission to allow third parties to contact you, personal information
                about you (such as your contact information and other information collected during
                your visit to BDX) may be shared with builders, product manufacturers, data aggregators,
                marketers (possibly in the form of list rental), and other organizations. Regardless
                of your decision regarding the sharing of your personal information, we may share
                broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business
                partners. This aggregate information does not contain any personal information which
                can identify any individual user.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Third Party Service Providers</em>-- From time to time, BDX may decide that
                it is more efficient to use third parties to perform specific services, such as
                sending newsletters to BDX's users. If we use a third party to provide specific
                services (such as sending newsletters to our users on our behalf), then information
                (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary
                for the third party to provide these services. These third party service providers
                are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing
                the specific services requested by BDX. The third party services covered by this
                paragraph do not include links to third party sites found on our site, which are
                governed by a more specific provision (Links to Other Sites) below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Disclosure to Law Enforcement and Similar Disclosures</em>-- While BDX strives
                to protect the personal information of our users, BDX will release personal information
                if required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary or
                appropriate.
            </p>

            <h3>SECURITY</h3>
            <p>
                BDX has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and/or
                unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. You are the only user
                authorized to update your profile, unless you provide your password information
                to another party.
            </p>
            <p>
                BDX helps protect personally identifiable information by utilizing both online and
                offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical
                access to the places where your information is stored. Our staff is trained to comply
                with our security procedures, and our security procedures are regularly reviewed
                and revised, if necessary, by the Privacy Team at BDX.
