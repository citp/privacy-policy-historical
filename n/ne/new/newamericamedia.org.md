# Privacy Policy - New America Media

Thank you for visiting newamericamedia.org. Your privacy is important to us. The following policy explains how your information is used when you visit our websites to purchase products, express an opinion, subscribe to our newsletters/Daily Headlines, or participate in our NAM Ethnic Online Ad Network.

**Traffic Data:**  Your individual identity or data is not personally identifiable and not collected when you visit our websites. Our servers, like most servers, collect basic information like domain name, referral url, browser and platform type, pages browsed. Most of the information is aggregated to track overall traffic patterns - most visited pages, total number of unique visitors.

**Subscription:** When you subscribe to our newsletters, magazines, or directory, we use your email or postal address information to send you the items. We may periodically call or email you about up coming events such as professional workshops, newsmaker briefings, polls sessions, expo and award ceremonies or about new products or services. We may share your information with a limited pool of partner organizations/foundations who may contact you via mail/email with services or products we think will be of value or interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such third-party mailings, please contact Dana Levine at [<dlevine@newamericamedia.org>](mailto:dlevone@newamericamedia.org) with your full name, address, email address and we will remove your name from our shared lists.

**NAM Directory:** We post basic information about our ethnic media partners’ organizations in our NAM Directory, which includes contact information for the Editor/Publisher and Advertising Manager. Our media partners have access to their accounts to update their information. They may remove themselves from the Directory by contacting Elena Shore at [<eshore@newamericamedia.org>](https://web.archive.org/web/20140518160308id_/http://newamericamedia.org/privacy-policy/eshore@newamericamedia.org).

**Secure online purchase:** When you make a purchase at the NAM online store, your credit card and payment account information is transacted in an encrypted form on secure servers.

**Online giving:** Online donations made to NAM are processed by PayPal. Details of these secure transactions, including name, address, email, and amounts are not shared with any outside organization.

**Comments and Email Story to a Friend features:** We do not use these email addresses and you will not receive any email or other communications from NAM as a result of having used these features.

**Advertising:** We feature advertising banners on our website hosted by third party servers. Some of the servers used by our advertising partners may use cookies to track your "click-stream" (your viewing and/or purchasing behavior, browser type, time and date and subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over). This online behavioral advertising (OBA) may be used to select advertisements that are likely to be of interest to the viewer. Any data they collect is separate from that collected by NAM.

This policy may be updated from time to time, so please check back periodically.
