Newsweek.com PRIVACY POLICY   
(effective as of October 15, 2007) 

At the same time that Newsweek and Newsweek.com are committed to bringing you information tailored to your individual needs, we recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of your personally identifiable information. Please note: this policy applies only to information collected by Newsweek and WPNI through Newsweek.com online, as specified below, and does not govern or apply to information collected or used by Newsweek or its affiliates through other means.

**What personally identifiable information do I provide to Newsweek.com?**

We may collect any information that you choose to enter through the Service.  This includes personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address, year of birth, gender, Zip code, country, street address, and other information about you that you may submit through the Service, including through any content that you provide on the Service. We may ask you for information when you register and at other times - such as when you enter a contest or participate in a promotion, when you provide content, or when you order products from us. Whenever you provide personally identifiable information to us, we will make an effort to link to our privacy policy. In some cases, we may combine this information with personally identifiable information we have collected about you from other sources, such as affiliated companies and through our subscription process. See below about "cookies" and what other information is collected.

**How does Newsweek.com use my personally identifiable information?**

Newsweek.com uses the personally identifiable information you provide to us in several ways. Some examples follow. 

A user's personally identifiable information may be used by Newsweek.com for editorial purposes such as to contact you as part of an online survey. Additionally, we may also use the information provided by you to: 1) contact you with legal notices, 2) to advise you of any material changes or additions to our Service or terms and conditions, 3) manage your account and update you on your account status (including confirmation of registrations), 4) provide you with the products and services you request, 5) respond to your questions and comments, and 6) perform business analyses or for other purposes to improve the quality of our business, the Service, and the products and services we offer. If you do not wish to receive the foregoing and therefore unregister from the site, please contact Customer Care <javascript:openAskWin(' <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/admin/help/popup/ask_pop_up.html'>)> and ask to have your registration account deleted.

Finally, we reserve the right to send you offers and information about Newsweek, its affiliates, and others that may be of interest to you. However, if you no longer wish to receive the foregoing, please contact Customer Care <javascript:openAskWin(' <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/admin/help/popup/ask_pop_up.html'>)> to request removal from this list.

Further, if you told us in your account preferences that you would be interested in receiving e-mail from us, we may send you e-mails about Newsweek.com products, promotions or services as well as on behalf of other companies.  However, if you no longer wish to receive any of the foregoing, you may change your preferences for the future at any time by clicking on the following link: 

<<http://services.newsweek.com/profile/profile.aspx?action=showNewsletters> >

In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. Newsweek.com delivers targeted advertisements on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, females over 25 years old). We take the advertisement and display it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. 

Newsweek.com also does research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior based on the information you provide to us including upon registration, on order forms, during a promotion, as well as from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis and Newsweek.com may share this aggregated data with advertisers or other businesses. In addition, under confidentiality agreements, Newsweek.com may match user information with third party data.

**With which third parties does Newsweek.com share my personally identifiable information?**

When you are on an area of Newsweek.com and are asked for personally identifiable information, you are providing that information to Newsweek and WPNI, our divisions or affiliates, or vendors providing contractual services for us (such as hosting vendors and list managers). If personally identifiable information is being provided to and/or maintained by any company other than these, our policy is that we will not transfer that personally identifiable information unless notice is given prior to transfer. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service or by expressing this preference, if requested. Additional information about personally identifiable information follows. 

**Promotions:** Promotions that run on Newsweek.com may be sponsored by companies other than Newsweek.com or may be co-sponsored by Newsweek.com and another company. Some or all personally identifiable information provided by you during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If information will be shared, we will disclose such sharing prior to the transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your personally identifiable information to be shared. In certain circumstances, you may not be able to participate in a particular promotion if you chose not to share personally identifiable information. 

**Advertisers and Links:** Newsweek.com advertisers, or Web sites that have links on our site, may also collect personally identifiable information directly from you. The information practices of companies collecting data on our site or Web sites linked to Newsweek.com are not covered by this privacy statement.

**Other:** If we run competitions or contests on the Service, you may be required to provide additional information such as your telephone number and address in order to participate. The exact rules may vary in each case but the specific rules for any contest will state how that information may be used. 

We may also share your personally identifiable information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, in response to a request for cooperation from law enforcement or another government agency, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; when we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or as otherwise required by law; to enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements, or otherwise protect or defend the rights or property of Newsweek or WPNI, their affiliates, or others, or the safety of the public; or in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale. 

We do not control the privacy policies of our advertisers, sponsors or other sites or businesses to which we provide hyperlinks or access. Please visit the sites of these businesses to review their privacy policies.

Except as stated in this privacy policy or at the time of collection, a user's personally identifiable information will not be transferred to a party outside Newsweek or WPNI, our divisions or affiliates, or our service vendors unless notice is given at the time of collection or prior to transfer. 

**Data Security:** We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the internet. 

**How can I access my personally identifiable information?**

You can access and update certain personal information you have provided on the Service through our account management system at <<http://services.newsweek.com/profile/profile.aspx?action=showNewsletters> >.

**What information do web servers collect?**   
Web servers serving Newsweek.com automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as which pages each user visits and the domain name ( e.g., earthlink.net) of visitors. This information is used for various purposes including internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors, and for traffic audits. We also provide this information (as well as information from third-party market researchers) about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers. We may combine this automatically-gathered information with other information, including personal information we have collected about you.

**What are cookies and how does Newsweek.com use them?**   
Newsweek.com places a "cookie" on the browser of a Newsweek.com user's computer to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a Web site; we may also use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as measuring certain traffic patterns. Advertising service vendors that serve ads into our site may also use their own cookies. You may opt-out of the cookies delivered by Newsweek.com by changing the setting on your browser. Please be aware that this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones delivered by Newsweek.com. We may combine the information we collect through cookies with other information, including personal information we have collected about you. 

**How Can I Opt-Out of Online Advertising Cookies?  
** Online advertising for Newsweek.com is delivered by the vendor DoubleClick. This vendor, like other advertising service vendors, places cookies on users' hard drives so that its systems can identify your computer. By placing such cookies on your system, DoubleClick is able, among other things, to determine automatically whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. It also enables DoubleClick to serve you advertisements tailored to things you have shown interest in based on other sites you have visited. DoubleClick allows visitors the option to opt-out of advertising cookies. If you do not want the benefits of advertising cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature. For more information about DoubleClick's use of cookies, and to "opt-out" of the cookies, visit <[http://www.privacychoices.org](http://www.privacychoices.org/)>

Please note that opting out through the above procedure will affect not only WPNI sites, but other sites served by DoubleClick as well. However, it will not affect the cookies used by Newsweek.com.

Often our advertisers contract with a third-party service to host their ads. In this case, an ad serving vendor contacts the advertisers' hosting service for a particular advertisement. In that case, an independent cookie may be used by the third-party service. We do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt-out of cookies from vendors with whom we do not have a contractual relationship. 

**Kids under 13:** In general, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If, in limited circumstances, we do knowingly collect personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we will do so only with verified parental consent prior to collection. In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy:** We may update this Privacy Policy in the future.  We will notify you about material changes to this Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the e-mail address you provided to us or by placing a prominent notice on the Service.

**How you can contact us:** If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at:  [Customer.Care@newsweek.com](mailto:Customer.Care@newsweek.com) .
