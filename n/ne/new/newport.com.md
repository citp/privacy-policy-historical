A "cookie" is a small data file that our site transfers to your device through your web browser that enables the site systems to recognize your browser and subsequently capture and remember certain information. We use both session cookies, which are erased upon closing your web browser, and persistent cookies, which may be stored for a certain period of time.

We use cookies to help us to improve your overall web experience when on our site. Cookies may enable us to remember and process the items in your shopping cart, to understand and save your preferences for future visits, to compile aggregated and anonymized data about site traffic and site interaction, and to reflect geographically accurate information regarding pricing. In some cases, we may contract with third party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. However, those service providers are not permitted to use any personal data collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business. In limit cases, we may allow such service providers to utilize aggregated, anonymized data for analytical purposes. We do not engage in "cookie swapping" or the sale of cookies to third parties.

You can configure most browsers to prevent them from accepting new cookies or to disable cookies altogether. We recommend that you leave cookies enabled as they allow you to take advantage of some of our essential website functionality. For example, if you block cookies, you may not be able to shop for products on our site or chat with our representatives online.

We limit the use of the data that we collect from you. We might use your data in connection with the following business purposes to:

  1. Improve user experience on our websites;
  2. Accept and fulfill orders and to meet our contractual obligations relating to such orders;
  3. Enable individuals to explore and compare the functionality and features of our products;
  4. Respond to customer inquiries and requests related to our products and services;

In some cases, we may store the data that you provide to us so that we can continue to (i) provide you with products and services for future orders; (ii) correspond with you regarding previous orders and service or warranty issues related thereto; and (iii) provide you with marketing and new product information and promotions. In addition, we may be required to store certain personal data due to legal and regulatory obligations (e.g., order data to comply with financial regulations and export laws).

We are not in the business of selling your data. We may in some cases have a need to share your data in connection with our business operations. Examples of this might include:

  1. Sharing data with employees that have a need to know that data in connection with a legitimate business purpose specified in the section above, such as fulfilling an order or answering a customer inquiry.
  2. Sharing data with our organizational subsidiaries and affiliated entities, including new businesses acquired through acquisition. Alternatively, in the event that we divest or transfer a technology, business unit or entity, we might be required to share or transfer that data to the acquiring entity.
  3. Providing data to third parties that are providing products or performing services on our behalf in connection with our business operations. We do not enable our service providers to use that data except as required to provide the product or service requested by MKS.

  4. Disclosing data where we believe it is required in order to comply with the law or to protect users and customers. For example, this may include exchanging information with companies for fraud protection, credit risk reduction, or compliance with export control laws.
