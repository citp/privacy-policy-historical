**Privacy Policy Statement**

This is the web site of NewOrleans.Com LLC. Our postal address is 179 Hickory Ave. Suite 100, New Orleans, La. 70123. We can be reached via e-mail at [info@neworleans.com](mailto:info@neworleans.com), or you can reach us by telephone at (504) 309-1004.

For each visitor to our Web page, where possible, our Web server automatically recognizes the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address.

We collect the e-mail addresses of those who post messages to our bulletin board and the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail. We also collect aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded, used to improve the content of our Web page, or used to notify consumers about updates to our Web site. No information collected is shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.

With respect to cookies: We use cookies to store visitors preferences, to record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and to customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please unsubscribe in the same manner that you subscribed, follow the instructions on the bottom of the mailing, or let us know by sending an e-mail to the above address, specifying the email or newsletter you no longer wish to receive.

If you supply us with your postal address on-line, you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us pertaining to the matter for which the phone number was provided or with information regarding orders they have placed on-line. Please provide us with your name and phone number and we will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations.

With respect to Ad Servers, we do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.

Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by calling us at the number provided above.

Upon request, we provide site visitors with access to unique identifier information (e.g., customer number or password) that we maintain about them, transaction information (e.g., dates on which customers made purchases, amounts and types of purchases) that we maintain about them, communications that the consumer/visitor has directed to our site (e.g., e-mails, customer inquiries), and contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain about them. Consumers can access this information by e-mail us at the above address.

Upon request, we offer visitors the ability to have inaccuracies corrected in contact information, financial information, transaction information, and communications that the consumer/visitor has directed to the site. Consumers can have this information corrected by sending us e-mail at the above address.

With respect to security, we always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information, such as financial or health information, we redirect visitors to a secure server and will notify visitors through a pop-up screen on our site. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.

If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at the above addresses or phone number, or you can contact the DMA's Committee on Ethical Business Practices at [mgoldberger@the-dma.org](mailto:mgoldberger@the-dma.org), state or local chapters of the Better Business Bureau, state or local consumer protection office, or the Federal Trade Commission by phone at 202.FTC-HELP (202.382.4357) or electronically at <http://www.ftc.gov/ftc/complaint.htm>
