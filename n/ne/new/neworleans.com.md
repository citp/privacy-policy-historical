 **Information We Collect**

To better serve site visitors and customers, NewOrleans.com collects two basic types of information from our customers:

• **Personally identifiable information:** This is information that personally identifies one individual from another. This information is voluntarily provided to us by our customers, _with their specific knowledge and consent,_ and is used by us for the purpose of fulfilling requests, inquiries or travel service orders. NewOrleans.com does not rent or sell any of this information to anyone.

• **Aggregate user and tracking information:** This information gives us insights on how our customers and site visitors use our site and our other products. This data is anonymous in nature and does not contain any personally identifiable information. We use this information to ensure that our website, e-mails and marketing efforts continue to appeal to our customers.

 **Other Information NewOrleans.com Collects**

When you visit the NewOrleans.com website, we automatically collect some information about your visit using cookies, web beacons, log analysis software and other aggregate tracking technologies.

 **Cookies**

Cookies are files that contain small amounts of data. If your browser is configured to accept these files, they are stored on your computer's hard drive. NewOrleans.com uses these data files when you visit our site to anonymously identify you. By using cookies, NewOrleans.com is able to:

• Completely support and enhance your visit to our site.

• Allow you to access your account information without requiring you to answer your sign-in question multiple times during the same visit to our site.

• Ensure that you won't see the same advertisements too often.

• Better measure how many users view and navigate our site.

• Better measure how effective our online marketing campaigns are performing.

If you wish, you may set your browser to refuse cookies. However, by refusing to accept a cookie, you will not be able to access some pages or purchase certain travel services on NewOrleans.com. Since many websites use some form of cookie technology, setting your browser to refuse cookies may restrict your access to certain information or product offerings on those websites. Some NewOrleans.com cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive unless and until you manually delete the file. NewOrleans.com cookie files do not contain personally identifiable information or track an individual users' movement through our site.

A NewOrleans.com third-party advertiser cookie file may also be placed on your hard drive during your visit to our website. The purpose of these types of cookies is to collect aggregate statistics about your visit to our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.

Should you choose to refuse or restrict these cookies, you should refer to the third-party advertiser's privacy policy for further information concerning the options available to you. For example, Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on NewOrleans.com. Google's use of the DoubleClick DART cookie enables it to serve ads to NewOrleans.com users based on their visit to NewOrleans.com and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20130502013308/http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

 **Tracking Pixels**

As a means of measuring the efficacy of the online advertising and marketing campaigns that NewOrleans.com employs, we may also allow third-party advertising companies to use a single-pixel image file on our site to collect information about your visit. This information is anonymous in nature. It only identifies actions being performed on our website. It does not tie actions back to any individual user of our website. No personally identifiable information is collected during this process.

Certain NewOrleans.com marketing and confirmation e-mails may also contain a single-pixel image file to detect when and whether you've opened the e-mail. NewOrleans.com may also track clicks from e-mail communications using an internal or third-party tracking system. NewOrleans.com uses this personal information to continually assess and improve the products and services we offer. NewOrleans.com also uses this information to inform you of products and services, sales and special offers that might benefit you.

These tracking mechanisms are used to ensure that the NewOrleans.com website and e-mails continue to provide relevant content that is interesting and useful to our customers.

 **Log file analysis**

NewOrleans.com also collects information from your computer each time you visit our site using javascript and log file analysis software.

Information we measure, analyze and collect in this manner may include: your IP address, screen resolution, operating system, platform information, your URL clickstream behavior (from referring URL website, through NewOrleans.com website, to and including URL of exiting website), date and time of your clickstream behavior, purchase behavior, clickstream patterns, e-mail address, NewOrleans.com user answer, cookie information, session information (includes: page interaction information, browser interaction information, page response times, length of visits to individual pages, download errors) and web browser software.
