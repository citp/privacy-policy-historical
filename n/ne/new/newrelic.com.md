Our third party company relationships help us to update, expand, and analyze our Personal Data records, identify new customers, optimize our Site and Services, create more tailored advertising to provide services that may be of interest to you, and manage open source projects. When we receive Personal Data about you from a third party, we will apply the principles outlined in this General Privacy Notice when dealing with your information.

  * to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;

  * to any other person with your consent to the disclosure.




Except as otherwise stated in this General Privacy Notice, we do not sell, trade, share, or rent the Personal Data collected from our Services to third parties.

## 5\. Legal basis for processing your Personal Data  

When we use your Personal Data, we take care to ensure that it is used in an appropriate way. Use of Personal Data under European data protection law must be based on one of a number of legal grounds as set out below. We will use your Personal Data and share that Personal Data where:

  * Its use is necessary in relation to our Services or contract you have entered into or because you have asked for something to be done so you can enter into a contract with us.

  * Its use is necessary because of a legal obligation that applies to us (except an obligation imposed by a contract). This may include responding to subpoenas, warrants or other requests served on New Relic anywhere in the world or to protect or defend the rights or property of New Relic or its users.

  * You have consented to its use in a specific way. For example where you have consented to receiving marketing materials. You may withdraw your consent at any time as further described in Section 9 (Your choices and data protection rights).

  * Its use is necessary to protect your vital interests. This will only arise in exceptional circumstances where we will use and/or disclose information about you to identify, locate and protect you if requested by a regulatory authority.

  * Its use is in accordance with our legitimate interests e.g. to manage our business, subject to those interests not overriding your fundamental rights and freedoms. This may include monitoring and administering our Site, corresponding with you in connection with our Services, research and development purposes, participating in partnership agreements or for the purposes of detecting and preventing illegal activities. We may also need to transfer some or all of your Personal Data to a third party or their advisors in connection with a sale, merger or reorganisation of our business. We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interests as part of any due diligence process for the purpose of analysing the proposed sale or reorganisation or after the sale or reorganisation for the same purposes as set out in this notice.




If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).  

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” section below.

## 6\. Profiling

In connection with our marketing activities, we analyze some of the information that we collect about our customers to determine what offers are more likely to be of interest to different categories of customers in different circumstances and at different times. We call this the creation of “segments”. From time to time, we will assess the Personal Data that we hold about you in order to assign you to a particular segment. We may use the segment that you have been assigned to in order to tailor our marketing communications to include offers and content that are relevant to you. We may also use this method to avoid sending you offers that are unlikely to be of interest to you.  

For example, if you are based in the EEA we can use your information to communicate with you about Services that we consider are relevant to you, in accordance with your marketing preferences.

## 7\. How long we hold your Personal Data

We retain Personal Data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). This may also include situations where litigation is pending or ongoing and such information is subject to a legal hold.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the retention of your Personal Data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to Contact Us” Section below.

## 8\. International Data Transfers

Your Personal Data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.

Specifically, if you are located in the EEA, you should note that your Personal Data will be accessed by New Relic staff or suppliers, transferred, and/or stored outside the EEA, including to the US and other countries which have different data protection laws.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this General Privacy Notice. These include implementing an adequate method of transfer, such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield, for transfers of Personal Data with our third party service providers and partners, further details of which can be provided upon request. We also participate and comply with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks. Please click [here](https://newrelic.com/privacy-shield) to read our Privacy Shield Notice.   

## 9\. Your choices and data protection rights

Providing and holding Personal Data comes with significant rights on your part and significant obligations on ours.

**a. Your marketing choices**

We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data. We will periodically send you newsletters and emails that directly promote the use of our Site or the purchase of our Services, in accordance with your marketing preferences.  

When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you have the opportunity to “opt-out” from receiving further marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the email you receive or by contacting us or about our Services by sending an email to [PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com](mailto:PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com) or by contacting us using the details provided under the “How to contact us” Section below.

Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings, we will retain a record of your preference (including retaining your email address) and we may share your email address with third parties solely for the purpose of ensuring that you do not receive further marketing communications related to our Services from third parties.  

Your email preferences only affect marketing communications.  New relic retains the rights, as well as the obligation in some circumstances, to send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Service, Services Privacy Notice, or General Privacy Notice, as well as necessary transactional communications.

### b. Your data protection rights

### 1\. Data protection rights that apply to all individuals:

You may correct, update or amend any of your Personal Data contained in your account by editing your profile within the registration portion of our Site, by sending an e-mail to us at the e-mail address at [PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com](mailto:PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com) or by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” section below.  

You may also request deletion of your account information by sending an email at [PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com](mailto:PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com) or by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” section below. However, please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).  

You can request to have us remove your Personal Data from a Site testimonial or remove your Personal Data from our blog by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” Section below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Data, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

We will endeavor to respond without delay.  We will otherwise retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services as well as is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

2\. Data protection rights specific to EEA residents

If you are located in the EEA, you may have the following additional data protection rights under EU data protection laws:

  * If you wish to find out if we use your Personal Data, or to access, correct, update or request deletion of your Personal Data, you can do so at any time by completing the [Personal Data Request](https://newrelic.com/content/dam/new-relic/privacy/personal-data-request-form.pdf) form and submitting it to [PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com](mailto:PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com) or by contacting us using the details provided under the “How to Contact Us” Section below.  

  * In addition, you can: object to processing of your Personal Data when that processing is based on our legitimate business interests, ask us to restrict processing of your Personal Data or request portability of your Personal Data. Again; you may exercise these rights by completing the [Personal Data Request](https://newrelic.com/content/dam/new-relic/privacy/personal-data-request-form.pdf) form and submitting it to [PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com](mailto:PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com) or by contacting us using the details provided under the “How to Contact Us” Section below.

  * Similarly, if we have collected and process your Personal Data with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details provided under the “How to Contact Us” Section below.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.




You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

3\. Data protection rights specific to California residents

Our customers who are California residents may request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, certain information about the Personal Data (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.  If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of Personal Data that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request by completing the [Personal Data Request](https://newrelic.com/content/dam/new-relic/privacy/personal-data-request-form.pdf) form and submitting it to [PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com](mailto:PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com) or by contacting us using the details provided under the “How to contact us” section below.  

We will endeavor to respond to without delay.  We may need to ask you additional clarifying questions in order to accurately respond to your request.  We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## 10\. Do Not Track

Currently, various browsers - including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to the websites visited by the user about the user’s browsers DNT preference setting.  New Relic does not currently commit to responding to browser’s DNT preference across its Sites and Services, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.  New Relic takes privacy and choices regarding privacy seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor the development around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard for DNT.

## 11\. Advertising

We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this Site and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. To learn more about targeted advertising and advertising networks and about your ability to opt out of collection by certain third parties, please visit the opt-out pages of the Network Advertising Initiative, [here](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), and the Digital Advertising Alliance, [here](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/). In addition, if you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising click [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or, if located in the European Union, click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)).

Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.

## 12\. Third Party Websites and social media widgets

This General Privacy Notice applies only to the use and disclosure of Personal Data that we collect while you use our Site(s).

Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents.  When you click on such a link, you will leave our site and go to another site. During this process, a third party may collect Personal Data from you.

We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content.  Please be aware that the terms of this General Privacy Notice do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on a link to a third party. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.

Our Sites also include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site.  These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site.  Your interactions with these features are also governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## 13\. Security of Your Personal Data

New Relic is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data.  We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For instance,  when you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  All account accesses require users to provide their username and password. It is the responsibility of each user to maintain this information in a secure manner. Despite these measures, you should know that New Relic cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Data and mistakes and security breaches may happen.  If you have any questions about security on our Sites, you can contact us using the details provided under the “How to Contact Us” Section below.

## 14\. Children

Our site is not directed to children and we do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 16. If you learn that anyone younger than 16 has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us using the details provided under the “How to Contact Us” Section below and we will take steps to delete such information.  

## 15\. Changes to this General Privacy Notice

This General Privacy Notice is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes in the way we use your Personal Data, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make.  We will obtain your consent to any material changes in the way we use your Personal Data and in accordance with applicable data protection laws. You can see when this General Privacy Notice was last updated by checking the “last updated” date displayed at the top of this General Privacy Notice.
