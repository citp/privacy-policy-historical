Except as otherwise stated in this General Privacy Notice, we do not and will not sell, Personal Data.

**5\. Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal Data**

When we use your Personal Data, we take care to ensure that it is used in an appropriate way. Use of Personal Data under European data protection law must be based on one of a number of legal grounds as set out below. We will use your Personal Data and share that Personal Data where:

●      Its use is necessary for a contract you have entered into or because you have asked for something to be done so you can enter into a contract with us.

●      Its use is necessary because of a legal obligation that applies to us (except an obligation imposed by a contract). This may include responding to subpoenas, warrants or other requests served on New Relic anywhere in the world or to protect or defend the rights or property of New Relic or its users.

●      You have consented to its use in a specific way. For example where you have consented to receiving marketing materials. You may withdraw your consent at any time as further described in Section 8 (Your Choices and Data Protection Rights).

●      Its use is in accordance with our legitimate interests e.g. to manage our business, subject to those interests not overriding your fundamental rights and freedoms. This may include monitoring and administering our Sites, communicating with you in connection with our Services, research and development purposes, participating in partnership agreements or for the purposes of detecting and preventing illegal activities. We may also need to transfer some or all of your Personal Data to a third party or their advisors in connection with a sale, merger or reorganisation of our business. We will do this on the basis of our legitimate interests as part of any due diligence process for the purpose of analysing the proposed sale or reorganisation or after the sale or reorganisation for the same purposes as set out in this notice.

If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). 

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, please see Section 15 (How to Contact Us).

**6\. How Long We Hold Personal Data**

We retain Personal Data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). This may also include situations where litigation is pending or ongoing and such information is subject to a legal hold.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the retention of your Personal Data, please see Section 15 (How to Contact Us).

**7\. International Data Transfers**

Your Personal Data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are located. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.

Specifically, if you are located in the EEA, you should note that your Personal Data will be accessed by New Relic staff or suppliers, transferred, and/or stored outside the EEA, including to the U.S. and other countries which have different data protection laws.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this General Privacy Notice and as required by applicable data protection law, including (i) requiring that our third-party service providers and partners employ an adequate method of transfer, such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield, for transfers of Personal Data (further details of which can be provided upon request), and (ii) participating and complying with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.

**8\. Your Choices and Data Protection Rights**

Collecting and handling Personal Data comes with significant rights on your part and significant obligations on ours.

a. _Your Marketing Choices_

We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data. We will periodically send you newsletters and emails that directly promote the use of our Sites or the purchase of our Services, in accordance with your marketing preferences.

When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you have the opportunity to “opt-out” from receiving further marketing communications from us by either (i) adjusting your e-mail preferences provided [here](https://try.newrelic.com/UnsubscribePage.html), (ii) following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the email you receive, or (iii) by sending an email to PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com.

Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings, we will retain a record of your preference (including retaining your email address) and we may share your email address with third parties solely for the purpose of ensuring that you do not receive further marketing communications related to our Services from third parties.

Your email preferences only affect marketing communications.  New Relic retains the rights, as well as the obligation in some circumstances, to send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Service, Services Privacy Notice, or General Privacy Notice, as well as necessary transactional communications.

b. _Your Data Protection Rights_

Data protection rights that apply to all individuals:

  * You may correct, update or amend any of your Personal Data contained in your account by editing your profile within the registration portion of our Sites or by sending an e-mail to PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com.


  * You may also request deletion of your account information by sending an email to PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com. However, please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).


  * You can request to have us remove your Personal Data from a Site testimonial or remove your Personal Data from our blog by sending an email to PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com. 



We will endeavor to respond without delay. We will otherwise retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services as well as is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Data, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

c. _Data Protection Rights for EEA Persons_

If you are a person located in the EEA, you have the following data protection rights under EU data protection laws:

  * You have the right to find out if we use your Personal Data, or to access, correct, update or request deletion of your Personal Data

  * You can object to processing of your Personal Data when that processing is based on our legitimate business interests, ask us to restrict processing of your Personal Data or request portability of your Personal Data.

  * Similarly, if we have collected and processed your Personal Data on the basis of your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.



  * You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.



If you are an EEA person and would like to make any of these requests, please submit your request to PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com

d. _Data Protection Rights for California Residents_  


New Relic provides services to business and complies with the applicable provisions of the California Consumer Privacy Act. If you are a California resident you have the following data protection rights:

  * You can request that we disclose to you certain Personal Data we collect, disclose for a business purpose and sell about you.

  * You have the right to request the deletion of certain Personal Data we collect from you.

  * You can obtain from us once a year, free of charge, certain information about the Personal Data (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.  If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of Personal Data that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year.

  * You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.

  * You have certain rights not to be discriminated against based on exercising your data protection rights, and we do not discriminate against any individual for doing so.




If you are a California resident and would like to make any of these requests, please submit your request to PersonalDataRequests@NewRelic.com.   


We respond to all requests without delay and in accordance with applicable data protection laws.  We may need to ask you additional clarifying questions in order to accurately respond to your request and to verify you are making the request in respect of your own Personal Data.

**9\. Do Not Track**

Currently, various browsers - including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to the websites visited by the user about the user’s browsers DNT preference setting.  New Relic does not currently commit to responding to browser’s DNT preference across its Sites and Services, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.  New Relic takes privacy and choices regarding privacy seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor the development around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard for DNT.

**10\. Advertising**

We may partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Sites or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner may use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our Sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. To learn more about targeted advertising and advertising networks and about your ability to opt out of collection by certain third parties, please visit the opt-out pages of the Network Advertising Initiative, [here](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), and the Digital Advertising Alliance, [here](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/). In addition, if you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising click [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or, if located in the European Union, click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)).

Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.

**11\. Third Party Websites and Social Media Widgets**

This General Privacy Notice applies to the use and disclosure of Personal Data that we collect as described herein.

Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents.  When you click on such a link, you will leave our site and go to another site. During this process, a third party may collect Personal Data from you.

We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this General Privacy Notice do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on a link to a third party. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.

Our Sites also include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site.  These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites.  Your interactions with these features are also governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

**12\. Security of Your Personal Data**

New Relic is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data.  We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For instance, when you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  All account accesses require users to provide their username and password. It is the responsibility of each user to maintain this information in a secure manner. Despite these measures, you should know that New Relic cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Data and mistakes and security breaches may happen.  If you have any questions about security on our Sites, you can contact us as described in Section 15 (How to Contact Us).

**13\. Children**

Our Sites are not directed to children and we do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 16. If you learn that anyone younger than 16 has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us as described in Section 15 (How to Contact Us), and we will take steps to delete such information.

**14\. Changes to this General Privacy Notice**

This General Privacy Notice is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes in the way we use your Personal Data, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make.  We will obtain your consent to any material changes in the way we use your Personal Data and in accordance with applicable data protection laws. You can see when this General Privacy Notice was last updated by checking the “last updated” date displayed at the top of this General Privacy Notice.

This Privacy Notice is effective as of the date set out at the top of this Privacy Notice.  It describes the categories of personal information that we have collected, disclosed for a business or commercial purpose and sold over the preceding twelve (12) months.
