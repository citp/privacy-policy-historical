We at News Corporation (herein, “News Corp” or the “Company”) respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) applies to personal customer information obtained by the Company, through [http://www.newscorp.com](http://www.newscorp.com/) (the “Site”). When you visit the Site, you are visiting News Corp’s corporate website. Affiliates of News Corp operate a large number of websites, mobile applications and other services associated with News Corp’s various businesses, brands and products. Each of these properties and services you may choose to visit has privacy notices that differ from this Notice due to the nature of those properties and services. This Notice does not apply to the websites, mobile applications and other services operated by News Corp affiliates. A list of News Corp affiliates is [here](https://newscorp.com/about/our-businesses/). By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Notice.

The Notice describes the types of personal information we obtain about customers, how we use the information and with whom we share it. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices. The Site is for a general audience, is not targeted to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

**Information We Obtain**

We obtain information about customers through this Site from you directly and by automated means, and may also obtain personal information from publicly and commercially available sources and from our Company affiliates and/or business partners (such as social media networks). The types of personal information we may obtain include:

  * Contact information (such as name, postal address, email address and telephone and/or mobile numbers);
  * Username and password when you register on the Site;
  * Geolocation data;
  * Other information you may provide to us, such as through our “Submit a Request” or “Contact Us” feature (such as gender and zip code); and
  * If you are a News Corp investor, information you may submit for stockholder benefits, such as through the “Electronic Delivery Enrollment” feature (such as social security number or tax ID number).



**Information Obtained by Automated Means Through the Site**

When you access and interact with the Site, we may obtain certain information through the Site by automated means, such as cookies (including HTTP, HTML5 and Flash cookies), web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies, including technologies designed to obtain information regarding your use of the Site. The information we obtain in this manner may include IP address, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on the Site, and dates and times you access or use the Site.

A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of the links and other content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be collected and stored.

We may link certain data elements obtained through automated means, such as your browser or device information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, what search queries you may have run. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. You also may be able to delete your Flash cookies or adjust your Flash cookie settings by visiting the Adobe Flash Website Storage Settings Panel and Global Storage Settings Panel. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of the Site.

The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on the Site, such as social media sharing tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of those features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers. The Company is not responsible for those providers’ information practices.

**How We Use the Information We Obtain**

  * Respond to inquiries from you and other third-parties, including inquiries from law enforcement agencies;
  * Anonymize personal information to provide our affiliates and third parties with aggregated data reports showing anonymized information and other non-personal information;
  * Supplement your personal information collected from you with additional information from publicly and commercially available sources, and/or information from Company affiliates and our business partners (a link to a list of News Corp affiliates can be found above and under the Information We Share section of this Notice);
  * Associate your browser and/or device with other browsers or devices you use for the purpose of providing relevant and easier access to content and other operational purposes;

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we have about you against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.

**Transfers of Information**

The Site may be hosted in and managed from a country outside the country in which you initially provided the information, including the United States. We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to the United States and/or another country, which may not be deemed to have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When your personal information is in such countries, it may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in accordance with applicable law. If you are a user located outside the United States or the country to which your information may be transferred, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States and/or such country. Your consent includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above. When we transfer your information, we will protect that information as described in this Notice.

**Links to Affiliate and Third-Party Sites, Apps and Services**

For your convenience and information, the Site may provide links to News Corp affiliates’ sites, apps and services, as well as those of third parties that may be operated by companies not affiliated with News Corp. Our affiliates have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review. Third-party sites may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, newsletters or applications developed and maintained by those unaffiliated third-party companies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any non-News Corp sites, apps or services.
