### News Corporation Statement of Privacy Principles

**PREAMBLE**  
News Corporation is one of the world's largest media companies. The U.S.-based businesses of News Corporation include: the production and distribution of motion pictures, television programming and related consumer products; television broadcasting; cable programming; the publication of newspapers, books, magazines and promotional free-standing inserts; marketing services; and Internet services. In this Statement of Privacy Principles these U.S. businesses are collectively called the News America Group. 

At the News America Group we strive to enhance our relationship with consumers. Collecting personal information about consumers is vital to this effort. 

This Statement of Privacy Principles describes the policies and procedures of the News America Group’s U.S.-based businesses for the collection, use and dissemination of personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person) about U.S. consumers in both the online and offline world. The Principles are based on the concepts of consumer notice and choice. 

The individual privacy notice of each News America Group business unit will indicate how that business unit is implementing this Statement of Principles by describing the business unit’s policies and practices regarding the collection and use of consumers’ personal information. 

The News America Group is actively involved in ongoing discussions about privacy and is continually monitoring privacy developments. Accordingly, from time to time we may modify these Privacy Principles to reflect changes in the law, self-regulatory initiatives and technology. 

**COLLECTION**  
The News America Group obtains personal information only if we believe the information is relevant to our relationship with a consumer or to assist us in creating a relationship with a consumer. We obtain personal information about consumers directly from consumers whenever possible, primarily in the course of providing them with products, information and services. The News America Group may also obtain personal information from third-party sources. In those instances where our information collection activities involve children, the News America Group provides special privacy protections.

**NOTICE**  
When the News America Group collects personal information from consumers, we inform them about who is collecting the information, why it is being collected, how it is being collected, the types of uses we will make of the information, whether we will disclose the information to third parties and the types of third parties to whom we will disclose the information, and consumers’ options regarding the use of their information.

**CHOICE**  
The News America Group provides consumers with an opportunity to choose whether the business unit that collects their personal information may use it for purposes that are different from those described either in its privacy notice or at the time the information was submitted.

**USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
The News America Group uses personal information to respond to our customers and to make decisions about the goods and services that the News America Group or its business partners provide or hope to provide to consumers. Each News America Group business uses personal information only in a manner consistent with these Privacy Principles and the applicable provisions of its privacy notice. Personal information is available only to our employees, affiliates, agents and contractors who have a business reason to have access to such information.

**SECURITY**  
The News America Group uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard personal information in its possession against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.

**ACCESS, CORRECTION AND DELETION**  
Whenever possible, each News America Group business unit provides consumers with the ability to access the personal information it maintains about them, to correct any information that is incorrect and to request the business unit to delete the information from its database.

**REMEDIES**  
Consumers may contact each News America Group business unit regarding privacy questions, complaints and disputes.

**COMPLIANCE**  
Each News America Group business unit will take appropriate measures to ensure compliance with these Privacy Principles.
