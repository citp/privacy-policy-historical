<p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) discloses the general privacy practices of NewsBank, inc., located at 5801 Pelican Bay Boulevard, Suite 600, Naples, FL 34108-2734, U.S., and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “NewsBank,” “We,” or “Us”). Any changes to this Policy will be posted on this page with an updated “effective date” posted at the end of this Policy.</p>

<h3>Information Collected and Purposes of Collection</h3>

<p>While visiting any of NewsBank’s websites including but not limited to,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newsbank.com/">www.NewsBank.com</a>;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.infoweb.newsbank.com/">www.InfoWeb.NewsBank.com</a>;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newslibrary.com/">www.NewsLibrary.com</a>;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.geneologybank.com/">www.GeneologyBank.com</a>; and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.readex.com/">www.Readex.com</a>&nbsp;(“Site”), We may ask you to register and/or provide Us with information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, street address, and e-mail address. On any page that collects Personal Information, We will specifically describe what information is required in order to enable your interaction with the Site, provide you with the product or service you are requesting, enter you in the promotion you have requested, respond to your inquiry or comment, or other uses as described in this Policy. We may also log IP addresses (the location of a computer on the Internet) from visitors such as yourself for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes and to determine site usage.</p>

<p>We may also use Personal Information to contact you regarding third party products and/or services that We believe may be of interest to you. You will at all times be able to opt out from receiving advertising communications from Us. Please refer to “Opting-Out” section below for more details.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information when needed to comply with the law or a legal process, to cooperate with investigations of purported unlawful activities, and to identify persons violating the law or our Terms of Use applicable to a given Site. In the event of a sale of part or all of NewsBank's stock or assets, our databases, including any Personal Information, will be transferred to the new owner.</p>

<h3>Third Party Products/Services</h3>

<p>If you sign up for a product or service We offer on the Site, We may share Personal Information with a third party such as a credit card processor and/or shipping and fulfillment services company, in order to provide you with the product or service you are requesting. These third parties are required to comply with this policy and to protect your information in the same way We do. They are not permitted to retain or use Personal Information for any purpose unrelated to providing the product or service you requested. By choosing to sign up for such products or services, you are agreeing to and acknowledging the release and use of your Personal Information to such third for such purposes, if necessary.</p>

<p>NewsBank may also post services and opportunities offered by unrelated third parties on the Site. Some of these third parties may also collect their own Personal Information. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy for that portion of the third party site prior to disclosing Personal Information to such third parties.</p>

<p>Third party sites linked to and from the Site are not necessarily under the control of NewsBank. NewsBank shall have no responsibilities or liabilities whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such linked site or any link or linking program at any time. NewsBank does not necessarily endorse companies (or related products or services) to or from which the Site is linked. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to the Site, you do so entirely at your own risk.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the collection, use and dissemination of Personal Information you submit to NewsBank via the Site, and not any Personal Information you may disclose to other parties (including via third party services or promotions offered on or through the Site). Different policies may apply to Personal Information you give to such third parties, and NewsBank shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of any such Personal Information.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>We may employ cookies (i.e., small data text files that websites send to your browser and are stored on your system) and other similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, ad tags, device identifiers, and web analytics services) to recognize you and/or your devices and to track your usage of the Site to help tailor it to your interests and needs. By tracking usage, We can also best determine the features that serve you best. In addition, by identifying your computer (but not any Personal Information) to our server, these tools also may allow you to avoid retyping your e-mail addresses and passwords each time you access the Site.</p>

<p>If We use an advertising server, developed by a third party, to display ads, which may contain cookies from third party advertisers, We do not have access to those cookies or any information in them. We encourage you to contact any advertiser and consult its privacy policy for more information on cookies used by such advertisers. Links from other web sites that appear on the Site may also send cookies; but We do not control such activities.</p>

<p>You may decline cookies by selecting an option on your browser. If you do so, however, portions of the Site which require registration may not be accessible to you, and you may need to re-submit certain registration information each time you access the Site.</p>

<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>

<p>NewsBank cares about the safety of children and their use of the Internet. Therefore, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, We will never knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. In the event that We receive actual knowledge that We have collected such personal information without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, We will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practicable.</p>

<h3>Opting-Out</h3>

<p>We respect your privacy and ability to choose whether to share information with Us and any third party. When choosing to use certain features or services on the Site, you can choose whether to share optional Personal Information in connection with that feature or service. If you receive communications from Us that you prefer not to receive, you may request to opt out from receiving these communications by contacting Us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@newsbank.com">privacypolicy@newsbank.com</a>.</p>

<p>You may "opt-out" altogether from providing Personal Information to Us by not registering on the Site and thereby not providing Personal Information. You may also choose at a later date to confirm the accuracy of your Personal Information that you have provided to Us, or inactivate your account by contacting Us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@newsbank.com">privacypolicy@newsbank.com</a>.</p>

<p>Certain portions of the Site and certain services provided on the Site, however, do require registration in order to access or use these areas and services. If you choose not to register or provide certain information, these areas will not be accessible to you.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>NewsBank maintains industry standard safeguards to help protect the security, integrity, and privacy of the Personal Information that you provide to NewsBank. Please understand, however, that there are inherent security risks in any online medium, and no guarantee can be made against unauthorized access by third parties.</p>

<h3>For Customers Located in the European Union</h3>

<p>Given that NewsBank is established in the U.S., your Personal Data will be transferred to the U.S. for processing, where less strict privacy protections may apply to your Personal Data than those in the EU. However, NewsBank will take reasonable measures to ensure your Personal Data remain protected in compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<p>You acknowledge that the transfer of your Personal Data to the U.S. is necessary for the purposes described above. You have the right to request access to, correction of, or erasure of your Personal Data. You may also request restrictions on or object to certain Processing of your Personal Data, or request the portability of your Personal Data. If you would like to make any such requests or would like more information about your rights related to your Personal Data, you can contact the NewsBank’s Privacy Officer at:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@newsbank.com">privacypolicy@newsbank.com</a>, or 1.800.762.8182. You understand and agree that NewsBank’s ability to comply with the requests you may make regarding the Processing of your Personal Data may be limited by NewsBank’s internal policies, and applicable laws and regulatory requirements that NewsBank is required to comply with. You acknowledge that the Personal Data collection, use, and transfer activities described in this Policy are necessary for the performance of the services rendered by NewsBank.</p>

<p>You also have a right to lodge a complaint with your country’s supervisory authority.</p>

<p>NewsBank will retain a copy of your Personal Data until completion of the purposes listed in this Policy or for as long as reasonably necessary for NewsBank to comply with applicable law and NewsBank’s internal retention policies.</p>
