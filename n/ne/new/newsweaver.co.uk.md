Disclosure of Information to Third Parties  
We may provide non-personal data to third parties, where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our website. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our website, the demographic breakdown of our community users of our website, or the activities that visitors to our website engage in while on our website. The third parties to whom we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties. 

We will not disclose your personal data to third parties unless you have consented to this disclosure or unless the third party is required to fulfil your order or to handle marketing or promotional communications on our behalf (in such circumstances, the third party is bound by similar data protection requirements). We will disclose your personal data if we believe in good faith that we are required to disclose it in order to comply with any applicable law, a summons, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other statutory requirement.

We reserve the right to transfer information (including your personal data) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Newsweaver provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Statement and provided that the third party only uses your personal data for the purposes that you provided it to us. You will be notified in the event of any such transfer and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt-out. 

Security  
The nature of the Internet is such that we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us via the Internet. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. However, we will take all reasonable steps (including appropriate technical and organisational measures) to protect your personal data. 

Access to accounts is restricted through a username and password authentication system and security is enforced through detailed logging and intrusion prevention.

This site also has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

Subscriber lists are kept separate and private and are never shared with other customers, our partners, or advertisers of any sort. Any information that is imported or entered by the customer remains the property of the customer.

In addition we can provide IP and domain filtering to both the authoring environment and the published newsletter.
