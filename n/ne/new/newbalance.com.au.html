	is respectful of the privacy concerns of the visitors to its web site. New Balance also 
	recognizes the valuable potential of technology to help people communicate with the companies 
	whose web sites they visit, particularly through customer databases. Responsible use of the information 
	you share with New Balance is paramount. In order to help you understand the role technology plays in 
	the collection and use of information you provide to New Balance, New Balance has created the following 
	privacy policy and guidelines.  By using this web site you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 
	If you do not agree with any terms or practices described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the 
	New Balance web site.<br>
						<br>
					</font><font class="blackbold">NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION<br>
					</font><font class="bodytext">In general, you can visit the New Balance web site and view its content while remaining anonymous
	by not providing any personal information. In some cases, when you visit the New Balance web site, New Balance may, 
	through the use of "cookies" (which are described in greater detail below), automatically collect information 
	about you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of 
	internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, the domain name of your 
	internet service provider and/or the web site from which you linked to New Balance's web site or advertisement.<br>
						<br>
					</font><font class="blackbold">PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION<br>
					</font><font class="bodytext">New Balance will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as 
	your name, address, telephone number or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily (for example, 
	if you complete our on-line Club NB registration form). New Balance's purpose for gathering such information 
	is to enhance your online experience by understanding you better and also to make you aware of new products or 
	offers in which you may be interested. For example, New Balance may use such information to send you directed 
	email with news and information on new content and features of the New Balance web site and new products and 
	services offered by New Balance and its partners. Use of any of the services on the New Balance web site is 
	entirely voluntary; however, if you do not provide the personal information requested by us, then we may 
	elect not to make the related services available for your use. If you have registered with New Balance and 
	do not want New Balance or its partners to contact you in the future, please see <a href="#optout" class="bodytextund">Opt-Out below</a>.<br>
						<br>
					</font><font class="bodytext">When you do provide us with personally identifiable information, we will take appropriate steps to protect the 
	information you share with us. In this regard, our policy is that we do not give, sell or otherwise transfer 
	your personally identifiable information to anyone outside the New Balance organization or selected New Balance 
	partners unless we first disclose to you at the time of collection that your personal information may be 
	provided to third parties.  However, there are certain limited instances where we may disclose or transfer 
	personally identifiable information.  For example, we may provide such information to appropriate authorities 
	if we believe in good faith that the law requires it or to protect the legal rights or property of New Balance. 
	Additionally, as we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell business assets. In such transactions, 
	customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets. However, we are not in the business 
	of selling customer information to others, and aside from certain exceptional circumstances, we will take 
	appropriate measures to ensure the protection of the information you provide to us.<br>
						<br>
					</font><font class="blackbold">USE OF COOKIES<br>
					</font><font class="bodytext">When you view one of our web sites or advertisements, we may store some information on your computer. This 
	information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. "Cookies" are alphanumeric identifiers that 
	are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your internet browser. Cookies enable our system to 
	recognize your browser and to tailor our web site or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences.
	They also make shopping and purchasing merchandise more convenient for you (for example, by allowing us to store
	items in your "Gym Bag" between visits). With most internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer 
	hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.  Please refer to your browser 
	instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. If you choose not to accept cookies, you should

	If it comes to your attention that your child under 13 has provided any personal information to the New 
	Balance web site, we invite you to notify us so that we may delete the information from our records and

	While New Balance's policy prohibits children under 13 from registering with the web site, parents should 
	supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online 
	services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can 
	also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without 
	parental permission.  For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the 
	"Consumer Assistance" page of the Direct Marketing Association home page
