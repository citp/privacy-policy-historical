## NEWZOO PRIVACY POLICY

We at Newzoo (Newzoo International B.V. and our affiliates) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to both our website ([www.newzoo.com](http://www.newzoo.com/)), client portal (portal.newzoo.com), and Subscription Service. This Privacy Policy governs our data collection, processing and usage practices. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.

If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use these services.

### The Information That Newzoo Collects

You are free to explore newzoo.com without providing any Personal Information about yourself. When you visit the portal.newzoo.com, register for our Subscription Service, or download a report, we request that you provide Personal Information about yourself and we collect Navigational Information. 

Personal Information refers to any information that you voluntarily submit to us and that identifies you personally, including contact information, such as your name, email address, company name, address, phone number. This can also include information about any transactions, both free and paid, that you enter into on the websites, and information about you that is available on the internet, such as from Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google.

Navigational Information refers to information about your visits to both our website ([www.newzoo.com](http://www.newzoo.com/)), and client portal (portal.newzoo.com), such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit, pages viewed, and device information. This is collected through the use “cookies”, which help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.

### How We Use Information We Collect

We use the information we collect only in compliance with this Privacy Policy. Customers who subscribe to our Subscription Service are obligated through our agreements with them to comply with this Privacy Policy. We will never sell your Personal Information to any third party.

In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may use your Personal Information to: (a) improve your browsing experience (b) send information to you which we think may be of interest to you by email (c) send you marketing communications relating to our business.

We use Navigational Information to operate and improve newzoo.com and the Subscription Service. We may also use Navigational Information alone or in combination with Personal Information to provide you with personalized information about Newzoo.  

If you give us credit card information, we use it solely to check your financial qualifications and collect payment from you. We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.

### Security of Your Personal Information

We secure the Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When sensitive Personal Information (such as a credit card number and/or geo-location data) is collected on our Websites and/or transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

### Retention of Personal Information

We retain Personal Information that you provide as long as we consider it potentially useful in contacting you about the Subscription Service or our other services, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements, and then we securely delete the information. We will delete this information from the servers at an earlier date if you so request, as described in **“Opting Out and Unsubscribing”** below.
