# Newstalk Privacy statement | Newstalk

This privacy statement is applicable to all Newstalk digital services.

NEWSTALK respects the privacy of its online users and will protect that privacy as vigorously as possible. This privacy statement may be updated from time to time to reflect changes to legislation or technology.

NEWSTALK adheres to the Data Protection Acts 1988 & 2003 and Regulation 5 of Statutory Instrument 336/ 2011

NEWSTALK does not collect information that personally identifies individuals except when individuals provide such specific information on a voluntary basis. There may be occasions where specific personal information is requested before an individual can enter certain sections of NEWSTALK ’s site or where registration helps us to ensure that content standards on these sections of the site are rigorously upheld or that contact can be made with prize winners or where a user requests to be sent push notifications. Information requested in order to personalise the Newstalk homepage or any other NEWSTALK site section would be a similar example.

In all such cases, NEWSTALK will collect only information that is voluntarily provided by the user and undertakes that such information will be kept strictly confidential. Individual information provided to NEWSTALK to gain access to any NEWSTALK site will not be sold or made available to a third party.

NEWSTALK does reserve the right, however, to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics, in order to measure interest in and use of the various sections of its sites so as to improve design and navigation and to gather marketing information. Only aggregated data from these analyses, not individual data, will be used for this purpose.

Users should be aware that certain non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by NEWSTALK through the operation of what are called "cookies". "Cookies" are small text files that identify an individual computer's browser entering a web site. They allow the site to track that browser's movement through the site over several sessions. Through cookies, a web site can recognise repeat users, facilitate the user's access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behaviour that will allow content improvements. NEWSTALK uses cookies only for the above-mentioned purposes and will not use them to identify users or to track non-NEWSTALK usage.

If you do not want a cookie placed on your computer by NEWSTALK , you may disable cookies altogether by modifying the Preferences section of Google Chrome or Internet Explorer browser (under Edit/Preferences/Advanced). Note that it is possible that some aspects of NEWSTALK sites may be unavailable to you if you choose this option.
