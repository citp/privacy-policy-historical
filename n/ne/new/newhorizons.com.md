**PRINCIPLES**

**Notice**  
New Horizons receives personal information about individuals in the EEA and Switzerland collected by New Horizons and its franchisees. This personal information may include basic contact information like name and email address, billing information, and courses and training taken by students. 

New Horizons uses this information to provide our educational and training-related services to franchisees, customer support for such services, to bill customers, and to correspond with customers. This information also facilitates our affiliates’ and franchisees’ services.

New Horizons uses this information for internal employment and human resources purposes. New Horizons commits to cooperate in investigations by and to comply with the advice of competent EU authorities.

New Horizons will subject all personal information received via the Privacy Shield and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework to their respective Privacy Principles. 

New Horizons is subject to the investigative and enforcement authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is obliged to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, for law enforcement, and national security purposes, and has potential liability for onward transfers to third parties.

Additionally, an individual may be allowed to invoke binding arbitration to resolve disputes under certain limited conditions.

**Choice**  
New Horizons will offer individuals the opportunity to choose whether their information is to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. An individual may opt-out of such uses of their personal information by contacting us at the address given below. New Horizons does not disclose personal information to non-agent third parties. If this changes, New Horizons will offer an opt-out to individuals. New Horizons will not use sensitive personal information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual unless New Horizons has received the individual’s affirmative and explicit consent (opt-in).

New Horizons contracts with third parties who perform business functions on our behalf. New Horizons uses these third parties to manage its IT system infrastructure, provide live, online support to customers, and to manage email lists.

For information received under the Privacy Shield, New Horizons will require its agents to safeguard personal information consistent with this Policy by contract, obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles. 

Under certain circumstances, New Horizons may bear liability for onward transfers of personal data where its agent processes personal data inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless New Horizons proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

For information received under the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor, New Horizons will obtain appropriate assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal information consistent with this Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include the following: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Privacy Shield and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, its own Privacy Shield or Safe Harbor certification, or another European Commission or Swiss FDPIC adequacy finding. 

**Access and Correction**  
Upon request, New Horizons will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, New Horizons will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. An individual may request to access their information, or otherwise correct, amend, or delete their information by contacting us at the address given below.
