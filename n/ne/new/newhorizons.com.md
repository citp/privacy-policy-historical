## Introduction

To provide you with the best possible service, New Horizons from time to time may ask for personal information. You may update or access your personal information you provide for your profile on the [www.newhorizons.com](http://www.newhorizons.com/),  [my.newhorizons.com](http://my.newhorizons.com/) (the "Integrated Learning Manager Website"), and [www.nhenglish.com](http://www.nhenglish.com/) (the "New Horizons English Learning Centers Website"), (collectively "NH Website") yourself any time. This can be done by logging on to any NH Website and selecting either "Edit Your Profile", "Change my Profile" or "Edit Your User Information." For security measures, in order to protect your information, you must first enter your user name and password before you can make any changes to your user profile. When you update your user profile, your new information will update our records that day.

This policy is to make you aware as to what type of information is gathered and tracked, what the information is for, and with whom the information is shared.

Attention: [www.newhorizons.com](http://www.newhorizons.com/)is the main home page to New Horizons Computer Learning Centers, Inc., which has the general privacy policy for the NH Website. To create easy entry to our privacy policy, this policy illustrates possible customer information throughout the [www.newhorizons.com](http://www.newhorizons.com/)Website. It is possible that not all personal information outlined in this policy will be used, but we want you to be aware of our policy and understand our procedures.

## Information Gathered and How it is Used

There are areas in which you can browse on the NH Website without giving us personal information. However, there are certain elective areas of the NH Website, where, prior to entry, you will be asked for personal information to correspond with you, provide service and support, present a more personalized experience as you navigate the sites, process your orders, or supply you with requested information. The NH Website may ask for the following information: user's first and last name, email address, mailing address, phone number and center location preference when collecting information through the registration process (or new member registration form) which allows access to the NH Website. The site also provides the ability to request information and this Information Request Form will also ask for personal information from you. The information you provide through the Information Request Form is shared with the Affiliate or Franchise center, (collectively "Network Members"), the user has specified to engage in transactions or provide future services. We require that the Network Members agree to abide by the restrictions on use and disclosure of personal information set out in this Privacy Policy. If you submit Personal Information in response to a Career Opportunity, please be advised that your personal information will be distributed within the company so that the hiring manager can contact you and potentially discuss an employment opportunity with you.

In order to access the Integrated Learning Manager Website you can simply register through [www.newhorizons.com](http://www.newhorizons.com/). The Integrated Learning Manager Web Site will require contact from Network Members only when training is purchased and access to that training is granted through the Integrated Learning Manager Web Site as the training portal. Information submitted to New Horizons will be used to create a uniquely identifiable account for tracking your learning activities.

If you take advantage of the "Live Help" feature used on any of the sites, please be advised that this feature is managed and provided by a third party contractor. This one on one technical help provided as a courtesy to New Horizons customers. If you take advantage of the opportunity, a Liveperson will gather your user name to facilitate the service, but will not disclose your user name to others.

If you wish to receive information on how to become a New Horizons Franchisee, New Horizons will collect your name, address, email address, what territory you are interested in, time frame on when you would like to invest in your own business, and how you heard about us from the Franchise Information Registration Form on the NH Website. The purpose for collecting this information is to enable our sales teams to respond to your inquiries with a better understanding of what type of training you are interested in purchasing.

If you register with [http://www.newhorizonsetips.com](http://www.newhorizonsetips.com/)(the "E-Tips site"), you will receive weekly information via e-mail which is based on four different categories, depending upon the preferences you select. In addition, you may elect to receive promotional offers from New Horizons and from other third parties.

If you seek information as an investor, you will actually be linking to a third party site which looks and feels like an New Horizons site but is not. It is designed this way to facilitate and provide easy navigation. You will be entering any information in this site on the Sharebuilder site, please check their privacy policy for more information on how your Personal Information imputed on this site will or can be used. <http://www.sharebuilder.com/sharebuilder/Home/Privacy.asp>
