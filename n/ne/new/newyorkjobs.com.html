	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


<div class="row"><div class="medium-9 medium-centered columns">

<h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
<p>
Your privacy is important to us. 
To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices. 
To make this notice easy to find, we make it available from the footer of every page.
</p>

<h2>Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>
<p>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
</p>

<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
The only personal identifying information we collect from you is information that you provide to us voluntarily by filling in and submitting a form.</p>

<h3>Registration Information</h3>
<p>
When you register with us, we collect your personal contact information. This information is visible only to trusted employees of the Easy Job Search Network.
We may use this information to contact you regarding your account with us, but we do not give this information to anyone outside of our company for any reason.
You can review and change your registration information at any time when you are logged into our site and we encourage you to do so when it is out of date.
</p>

<h3>Job Listing Information</h3>
<p>
If you are registered as an employer or a recruiter, you can submit job listings to our database.
The job listing information you submit will be freely accessible via the Internet and visible to anyone who visits our web site.
You are not required to include any private, confidential or identifying information in your job listings.
You can review, change or delete your job listings at any time when you are logged into our site and we encourage you to do so when they are out of date.
</p>

<h3>Resume Information</h3>
<p>
If you are registered as a job seeker, you can submit your resume information to the database and it will be visible to qualified, pre-screened employers and recruiters who search the resume database. 
You are not required to include any private, confidential or identifying information in your resume.
You can change or delete your resume at any time.
</p>

<h3>Credit Card Information</h3>
<p>
When you choose to pay for a purchase using a credit card, the credit card information is encrypted by your web browser before it is transmitted to our secure server over the Internet.
If your browser is not able to provide a secure, encrypted connection, your web browser will display a warning.
</p>
<p>
Once our server receives your credit card information, it is immediately relayed to our credit card processor in encrypted format. 
If the credit card transaction is approved, we store the information pertaining to the order in our database for our records, where it is visible only to trusted employees.
<em>We never store your credit card number in any format.</em>
</p>

<h3>Anonymous Usage Information</h3>
<p>
We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous data on how people use the site in order to continually improve your experience. 
This information is <em>never</em> tied back to you as an individual and can never be used to identify you. 
However, if you would like to opt out of this tracking, Google has provided a way for you to do so <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
<p>
See the section above entitled "The Information we Collect" for full details on the information we collect and how it is used.
</p>

<h2>How We May Share the Information</h2>
<p>
We have never shared personal contact (registration) information with anyone outside of the company for any reason whatsoever and never will.
</p>

<h2>How You Can Access and Update Your Information</h2>
<p>
You can access, review and change any information you've submitted to our web site by logging into our site, going to your account and clicking the appropriate link. 
Using this procedure, you can change your registration information, change your password, manage your resume, manage your job listings, etc.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
Our login system uses a "cookie" to identify you to our system software as a legitimate registered user so that we can protect the privacy and integrity of the information you have submitted to our web site. 
A cookie is just a tiny piece of information that your browser allows our software to store in your computer's memory and sends back to us every time you request a page from our site.

<h2>Help Us Protect Your Information</h2>
<p>
We do everything we can to ensure the privacy and integrity of your information. 
The truth is, however, that a large part of the responsibility lies with you. 
Here are some things you can do to help us help you:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Choose a password that is difficult to guess (either by a human or another computer). If your password is a word you can find in a dictionary or a book of names, it's a bad password.</li>
	<li>Change your password from time to time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Contact us</h2>
<p>
If you ever have any problems, questions, complaints or suggestions, please feel free to <a href="/contact-us.htm">contact us</a>.
