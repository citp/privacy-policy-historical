**1\. Introduction**

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains what information we collect about you and why, what we do with that information, how we share it, and how we handle the personal information created, inputted, submitted, posted, transmitted, stored or displayed by you or your Agents when accessing and using our Services. Certain terms that are capitalized in this policy are defined and have the meaning applied in our Terms of Service.

For the purposes of this Policy, our “Services” refer to any services provided by the NewsWhip Group (including Spike, Insights, and/or any API), as more completely described in our Terms of Service. Each Service shall also include any Additional Services.

If there are any material changes to this Policy, you will be notified by email, through the Service, or by posting a prominent notice on our Websites prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of our Services or Website constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to this Policy. Your only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of our Service and our Website.

**9\. Location of Data**

**IMPORTANT: When you use the Website or Services, your data may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries.**

The NewsWhip Group may transfer, store, use and process your information, including any Personal Information, to countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) including the United States. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your information is transferred to or stored, used or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.

**10\. European Safe Harbors**

We provide our Services to subscribers located within the EEA and Switzerland and, in so doing, process their Service Data, which may include personal information. We only access the Service Data where reasonably necessary to provide our Services (for example, to respond to support requests), as authorized by our subscribers, as disclosed in this Policy, or where we believe necessary for compliance with law. In legal terms, this means we are a data “processor” with respect to Service Data and our EEA and Swiss subscribers are the data “controllers”. As the data controllers, our subscribers are responsible for complying with applicable EEA and Swiss data protection laws and must assist their Agents and End-Users to exercise their data protection rights. As a data processor, we process this information in accordance with our subscribers’ instructions and have implemented security measures to protect against unauthorized and unlawful processing. 

The NewsWhip Group complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. The NewsWhip Group has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement. 

If your principal location is in the EEA, we will ensure, pursuant to Article 25 of the Directive that, to the extent that any Service Data constitutes Personal Data, if Service Data is transferred to a country or territory outside of the EEA (a “non-EEA country”), specifically to the Unites States; then such transfer will only take place if: (a) the non-EEA country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection; (b) one of the conditions listed in Article 26(1) of the Directive is satisfied; or (c) We have ensured that the transfer is subject to adequate safeguards (such as the model contractual clauses designed to facilitate transfers of Personal Data from the EEA to all third countries that have been adopted by the European Commission (known as the, “Standard Contractual Clauses”) or adherence to the principles of the Personal Data Safe Harbors).

If you have questions or complaints regarding our Policy or practices, please contact us [legal@newswhip.com](mailto:legal@newswhip.com). 

**11\. Protection of Information**

We are committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We utilize robust precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information within our Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully developed security procedures. For example, when you enter confidential information (such as login credentials or information submitted from within the Service), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your Service Data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your Service Data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.

**12\. Data Hosting, Transfer, and Retention**

Unless we expressly agree otherwise, the NewsWhip Group may host and process Service Data, including personal information, in the United States, the European Union, and in other countries through the NewsWhip Group and third parties that we use to operate and manage our Services. Whenever we process personal information outside of the European Economic Area on behalf of our subscribers located in the EEA or Switzerland, we will continue to afford it adequate protection in accordance with the requirements of the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.

We will retain Service Data that is processed on behalf of our subscribers in accordance with the instructions received from our subscribers for as long as needed to provide our Services to our subscribers, subject to compliance with this Policy. We may retain and use other personal information, including personal information we collect as a “data controller,” as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, maintain accurate accounting, financial and other operational records, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as described above. 

**13\. Children’s Personal Information**

If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through our Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information through our Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us through our Services, please contact us, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information. Subscribers are responsible for establishing policies for and compliance with applicable laws for the collection of personal information in connection with the use of our Services.
