<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>New Relic, Inc (<strong>"New Relic"</strong>) is committed to protecting
  your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices
  regarding the Application Data and Personal Data (each as defined below) that we
  collect from users of our website (located at www.newrelic.com), the New Relic
  RPM products (the <strong>"Products"</strong>), or related services. This Privacy Policy
  is incorporated into, and considered a part of, the New Relic Terms of Use, currently
  located at <a href="terms.html">www.newrelic.com/terms</a>.</p>

<h2>User Consent</h2>

<p>By submitting or making available Application Data or Personal Data through our
  website, Products, or related services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy
  Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Application Data and
  Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Data may be
  processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including
  the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less
  stringent than the laws in your country.</p>

<h2>A Note About Children</h2>

<p>We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13.</p>

<h2>Types of Data We Collect</h2>

<p>New Relic collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our
  site, when you send us information or communications, and/or when you download
  and use our Products. <strong>"Personal Data"</strong> means data that allows someone
  to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone
  number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that
  is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. <strong>"Anonymous Data"</strong> means
  data about you that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data (but
  does not include Application Data, which is covered later in this Privacy Policy);
  Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect
  Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below..</p>

<h3>Personal Data You Provide to Us</h3>
<p>We collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, e-mail and mailing
  addresses, telephone number, professional title, company name, and password, when
  you purchase Products, register to receive information, or register for support
  forums. In addition, we (or our third-party credit card or payment processor on
  our behalf) will collect Personal Data including your credit card number or account
  information when you purchase Products or services on our website. We also retain
  information on your behalf, such as the Personal Data described above and any correspondence
  or forum postings. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail (e.g., in
  response to an employment opportunity posted on our website), we will collect your
  name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in
  order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a
  resume. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile
  information. When you post messages on the message boards of our website, the information
  contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be
  able to see it. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to
  us voluntarily, such as operating system and version, information about your application
  and operating environment, and other requested information if you contact us via
  e-mail regarding support for the Products). We may also collect Personal Data at
  other points in our website that state that Personal Data is being collected.</p>
<h3>Personal Data Collected via Technology</h3>
<p>To make our website, Products, and related services more useful to you, our servers
  (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect Personal Data from
  you, such as browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a
  number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet,
  which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp
  for your visit. We may also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data
  like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and
  time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and
  which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal
  Data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or access your account
  on our network.</p>

<p><strong>"Cookies"</strong> are small pieces of information that a website
  sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use
  both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent
  Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with
  a more personal and interactive experience on our website. Persistent Cookies can
  be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to
  disable Cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly.</p>

<h3>Personal Data Collected by Third Parties</h3>
<p>We may receive Personal Data about you from other sources like telephone or fax,
  from companies that provide our Products or services by way of a co-branded or
  private-labeled website, companies that offer their products and/or services on
  our website, or companies that provide services (such as payment processing services)
  in connection with our website (<strong>"Partner Companies"</strong>). Our Partner Companies
  may supply us with Personal Data, such as your name and e-mail and mailing address
  information, in order to help us establish the account or fulfill orders. We may
  add this information to the information we have already collected from you via
  our website in order to perform and improve the Products and services we provide.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Privacy Policy, only New Relic
  collects Personal Data through our website, Products, or the related services provided
  solely by New Relic. This Privacy Policy applies only to the use and disclosure
  of Personal Data that we collect while you use our website, Products, or related
  services. </p>

<p>Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience
  and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents.
  When you click on such a link, you will leave our site and go to another site.
  During this process, a third party may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data
  from you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside
  websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy
  do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data
  after you click on a link to a third party. </p>

<h2>Use of Your Personal Data</h2>

<p>In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests
  that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. New Relic uses your Personal

  opportunities or other requests; send promotional communications; provide you with
  hardcopy or electronic newsletters, or surveys; send upgrades and special offers
  related to our Products and related services and for other marketing purposes of
  New Relic or our Partner Companies, should you request to receive such communications
  from us; make telephone calls to you, from time to time, as a part of secondary
  fraud protection or to solicit your feedback.</p>

<p>We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information
  (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you. We use this
  Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the
  content of our Products and services and improve site navigation. New Relic reserves
  the right to use for other purposes and to disclose Anonymous Data to third parties
  in its discretion. </p>

<p>If you provide feedback on any of our Products or related services to us, we may
  use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback
  with your Application Data or your Personal Data. New Relic will collect any information
  contained in such communication and will treat the Application Data and Personal
  Data in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

  or to provide specific services, such as hosting of your applications or payment
  processing for purchases.</p>

  access to Personal Data that we collect from its customers. As a result, we may
  provide your Personal Data to a Partner Company. Because we do not control the
  privacy practices of our Partner Companies, you should read and understand their
  privacy policies.</p>

  Related Entities, in which case we will require our Related Entities to honor this
  Privacy Policy. If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company

  and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described
  below), New Relic may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that
  such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to
  subpoenas or warrants served on New Relic; or (b) protect or defend the rights
  or property of New Relic or users of the Products or related services. </p>

<p>Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not generally sell, trade, share,
  or rent the Personal Data collected from our services to third parties. You expressly
  consent to the sharing of your Personal Data as described in this policy.</p>

<h2>Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Data</h2>

  Data. We will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly

  such requirements). When we delete account information, it will be deleted from
  the active database, but may remain in our archives.</p>

  New Relic’s products so that individual Transaction Data is not obfuscated. You
  also have the option of disabling collection of certain types of Application Data
  collected through our Products and services, which you may exercise by following
  the instructions in the user manual for the applicable Product or service.</p>

  or warrants served on New Relic; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property
  of New Relic or users of the Products or related services.</p>

  policy.</p>
