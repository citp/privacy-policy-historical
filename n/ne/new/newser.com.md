If it does, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on the Newser Website, with an indication of the date of the most recent revisions.

These communications may include, without limitation, notices regarding material changes to the Newser Website’s policies, service updates, and service enhancements.

## What other information is collected about me on the Newser Website and by whom?

  * Like most websites, Newser employs cookies to recognize you and your access privileges on the Newser Website. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can store in a designated file on your computer. When you visit a site, that site can access only the information which it stored in your cookie – not information put on your computer by other web-based services. Newser’s cookie does not store any of your personally identifiable information.
  * Newser maintains internal logs of users’ use of the Newser Website. Logs include information such as IP address, browser type and version, and computer operating system. Newser uses logs mainly for systems administration and diagnostic purposes, and to detect improper use of the site. Logs may also be used to generate aggregate, non-personally identifiable information for advertisers or other third parties.
  * Newser may also contract, from time to time, with third parties to help us understand how people use our website and to provide functionalities such as e-mail distribution, ad serving and customer surveys. These companies also use cookies. They may also use other tracking technologies, such as web beacons (also known as clear GIFs, web bugs, tracking pixels or action tags), which are similar in function to cookies, allowing them to determine when users have reached particular web pages on the Newser Website.

Newser reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its website members and visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not personally identifiable information, only summaries of the activities or broad characteristics of our users. 
  * Omniture uses cookies and web beacons to help track visitor behavior and sets cookies on behalf of Newser which will be listed under the domain 2O7.net.

  * We sell advertising on our site so that we can provide our service for free. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Most of the advertisements appearing on this website are delivered to you by 24/7 Real Media, Inc., our web advertising partner. Information about your visit, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.
