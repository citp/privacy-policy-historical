# Privacy Policy & Liability Statement for NewArticle.eu

**How we gather information from users**

Our information collection depends on what page you are visiting, as well as what portions of this website you elect to provide the information. When you register for an author account, you will be asked to privde certain information. Additionally, you may be asked to provide information for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. Like most Web sites, NewArticle.eu  also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic  tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit, such as your login username. Among other things, the cookie may store your password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit.

In certain cases, you may choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site.

**What we do with the information we collect**

Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on www.NewArticle.eu to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by www.NewArticle.eu and other topics we think you might find of interest.

Personally Identifiable Information collected by NewArticle.eu may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
