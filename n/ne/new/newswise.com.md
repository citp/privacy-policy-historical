**Do the Newswise website use cookies?**

Newswise sends a “cookie” to your computer that contains an identification number that is unique to the computer you are using. We use this cookie to provide you with a continuous experience, and for us to record how our service is being used.

As is done with most web sites, we log each visit to each web page. A log entry can contain information typically found in the “header” of your web browser’s request such as the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. We may also log your cookie’s identification number and the URL of the last site you visited. If you are a journalist, your journal affiliations will be noted in the record of hits for an article, and shared with our clients as an aggregated statistic. Statistics for individual journalists’ visits are not shared. Log information is important for security, audit, quality improvement, as well as for monitoring the health and use of our service.

Please note that if you click on a link to a third-party website from the Newswise website, the linked-to site may have different policies and practices with regard to cookies and Newswise has no control over and is not responsible for such policies or practices. You should always consult the privacy policy governing any website you visit on the Internet for complete information about their policies and practices.

  
**What security measures does Newswise take to safeguard its online users’ privacy?**

Information you submit at a Newswise website upon registration for specific services is password protected so that the only parties who have access to the information besides Newswise and its agents are the member entity and its employees.

In addition, individual employees of members will receive individual accounts and passwords to use when they log on to submit press releases online.

In order to protect the integrity of the password system, members should refrain from disclosing passwords and immediately change any passwords that may have been compromised.

Newswise will never ask you for your password by email, so members and their employees should not respond to unsolicited e-mail requests asking for password information even if such requests appear to be from Newswise.

Please be advised that no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secured. Newswise is committed to protecting users’ personal information, but cannot guarantee or warrant the security of this information when it is sent to or through the Newswise website. Transmission of such information is therefore at the risk of the user.

  
**Usernames and Passwords**

Users may register with [http://www.newswise.com](http://www.newswise.com/). Once usernames and passwords (the “Login Information”) are issued to users (the “Authorized Users”), the Authorized Users accept full responsibility for the use of the Login Information. The Authorized User may not, under any circumstances, release their Login Information to any other person for any reason, and is required to keep the Login Information strictly confidential. If any breach of security, theft or loss, or unauthorized disclosure of the Login Information occurs, the Authorized User must immediately notify Newswise of such security breach.

  
**Privacy policy updates**

This policy will be updated from time to time as necessary to add new services and functions. Newswise will provide you with notice of any changes or updates to this policy.
