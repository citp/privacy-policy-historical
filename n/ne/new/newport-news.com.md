**Third Party Merchants "Presented By Newport News"**

If you make a purchase from a Merchant Site with a link originating from the Newport News site or a Merchant catalog or website "presented by" Newport News, the information you provide to that Merchant, and any other information you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the Merchant and not to Newport News. Providing this information to the Merchant enables the transaction to take place. However, you should know that the Merchant may, if you do not advise them to the contrary, share your name and postal and e-mail addresses with third parties, including Newport News.

Merchants on the Newport News site and those Merchants, who send catalogs or host websites "presented by" Newport News, have separate privacy and data collection practices. We have no control over and therefore no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding Merchants appearing on Newport News or other Merchants who send catalogs or host websites "presented by" Newport News and their privacy policies, please see the Merchant's home page and click on their Information link or review the customer service section of any catalog you may receive from the Merchant. 

The Merchants that have links on the Newport News site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of these Merchants are not covered by the Newport News privacy statement.

**How do you know your information is secure?**

When you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window, then your site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving your information on our site. If you do not see one of these icons, please contact your Internet service provider. When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial information, we will redirect you to a secure server and notify you through a pop-up screen on our site. 

We have appropriate security measures in place in our facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site so you can feel comfortable and secure.

**Conflict In Terms**

It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created this easy-to-read Privacy Statement with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our Privacy Statement into a computer readable format and then translate it back into human readable format for you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary". To the extent that this Policy Summary is inconsistent with, fails to address or addresses an issue not raised in, our Privacy Statement, you should rely on our Privacy Statement as it is the controlling authority.
