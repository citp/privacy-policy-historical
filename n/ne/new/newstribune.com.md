If you have any questions or concerns about these privacy guidelines, please send an [email to the Webmaster](mailto:nt@newstribune.com).

Any information you provide when you visit web sites other than those covered by this policy (including other web sites affiliated with Central Missouri Newspapers Inc) or when you purchase any products or services that may be offered or advertised on our web site by companies other than Central Missouri Newspapers Inc is subject to the privacy policies of the third party organizations who run and/or own these web sites.

Your IP Address:  
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers - the computers that send out Web pages - automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Central Missouri Newspapers Inc collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. Central Missouri Newspapers Inc does not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and policies or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others. 

Cookies:  
Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at a site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or from our affiliate sites. Central Missouri Newspapers Inc does not control these cookies, and they may or may not collect personally identifiable information. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. Central Missouri Newspapers Inc (or third party service providers on our behalf) may also use cookies to collect aggregate information about web site users on an anonymous basis. We may share aggregate demographic and usage information with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and other third parties for any business purpose.

When you conduct e-commerce with one of the e-commerce affiliates to which our site is linked, personal information such as your email and home address may be collected by the vendor's server and made available to us.
