# Privacy Statement - Daytona Beach News-Journal

The News-Journal family of websites understands that privacy is important. This privacy policy applies to all of the online Services offered by News-Journal (and does not necessarily reflect the News-Journal's offline policies). This Policy is an integral part of the News-Journal Terms of Service and is integrated therein. If not otherwise defined herein, the definition of any capitalized term is the same as the definition in the Terms.

_**1\. Information we Collect and How We Use It.**_ The News-Journal collects information about you when you register with the News-Journal, when you use the Services, when you visit News-Journal pages, and when you enter News-Journal promotions.

**a. Registration.** When you sign up for news-journalonline.com's E-delivery newsletter or any other News-Journal Service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, address, or telephone number). For the same or other services, we may ask you for credit card or other payment account information. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other News-Journal Services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.

**b. Cookies.** When you visit a News-Journal website, we send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends. News-Journal also allows other companies that provide services or display advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. Advertisers and other companies do not have access to News-Journal's cookies.

**c. Server Log Information.** When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your Internet Protocol address, cookie information, and the page you request.

**d. User Communications.** When you send email or other communications to the News-Journal, the News-Journal may retain those communications indefinitely.

**e. Affiliated Sites.** Some of the Services (including, but not limited to embedded video) are provided by third party vendors to the News-Journal. As such, the privacy policies of those vendors will govern the use of those Services provided by such vendors as well as the information provided by you, or collected in association with, those sites. You acknowledge that some of these Services and pages may bear a News-Journal brand and appear to be News-Journal pages. 

**f. Use of Information.** News-Journal uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for products or services, to improve our services, and to contact you when necessary. News-Journal may also disclose your personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. News-Journal may also disclose your personal information if News-Journal believes it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of News-Journal's Terms, or as otherwise required by law. News-Journal may share with third parties certain aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you personally.

_**2\. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Notices.**_  
**a. Prohibition of Disclosure of Information.** Children under 13 are not permitted to disclose any personally identifying information in relation to any Service. This means that children may not register for any product or service.   
**b. Filtering Notices.** There are commercially available services and software that limit access to objectionable information.

_**3\. Targeted Advertisements.**_ News-Journal displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including advertisement serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria. News-Journal does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 

_**4\. Modification or Deletion of Account Information.**_ You can edit or delete your E-delivery newsletter account information at any time at [www.news-journalonline.com/online/email.htm](http://www.news-journalonline.com/help/email.html). Some information about you and your account may remain in our archived records after modification and/or deletion.

**5\. Sale or Merger of Business.** If News-Journal becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will transfer the information to the resulting entity, which may or may not utilize the same privacy policy.

**6\. Changes.** News-Journal may update this policy at any time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a prominent notice on our website.

**7\. Comments or Questions.** If you have any questions or comments about this policy, please contact our Webmaster, Chris Bridges, at [chris.bridges@news-jrnl.com](mailto:chris.bridges@news-jrnl.com).
