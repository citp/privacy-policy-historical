##### Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of web sites to which we may link.

##### The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the NewsGator.com website. On some pages, you can order products, and register to use our forums. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

##### The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

We do not currently use our database of customer information directly for marketing purposes; should this policy change in the future, you will have the opportunity to opt-out of any such marketing communication. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

We use session cookies (cookies which are only used for a single session) during the ordering process, and in the NewsGator forums. 

We use persistent cookies (cookies which will are stored on your computer and used for multiple sessions) only if you choose to use the auto-login feature of the NewsGator forums. 

##### Our Commitment To Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. All personal information is transmitted in encrypted format using SSL, and individual credit card information is not stored on our systems at any time after the completion of an order.
