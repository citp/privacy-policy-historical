# New Statesman

The _New Statesman_ is determined to protect your privacy. It is very important to us that you should be able to use and enjoy the website without having to reveal more information than is necessary. 

However, knowing some information about our users is necessary to ensure that our service is continually improved. To be able to communicate with you we need to build an accurate picture of the needs and wishes of our users. This enables us to offer a service that is relevant and interactive. 

**Q:** _"What information do you collect about me?"_

**A:** This depends on the nature of your involvement with our website. We may ask you to provide personal information on a voluntary basis in order to get a clearer picture of our users. It is then up to you whether give us this information.

If you enter our competitions, promotions or participate in other online offers you will need to give us some details about yourself. You may also choose to email us or [contact us](http://www.newstatesman.com/nscontactus.htm) in other ways. Such contact gives us information about you. 

If you have any financial dealings or make purchases with our trading partners they will ask for certain information. Some of this information will be shared with us so that we can send you your purchases. We do not see or keep credit card details unless you specifically send them to us. 

**Q:** _"For what purposes do you collect and use this information?"_

**A:** We use aggregate audience details (where no individual is identifiable) to help us improve our understanding of our users and their preferences. We use it to assist us in arranging relevant advertising, commercial opportunities and competitions, as well as ensuring the best editorial coverage. It also helps us develop the website and audit its use. 

The information about you as an identifiable individual, including contact details, may be used in the following ways: 

  * to conduct market research and other surveys. 
  * to create and draw to your attention editorial material and commercial opportunities that may be of interest to you. 
  * to be shared with advertisers, trading partners and other commercial entities with whom we have or might have an association. We may also share the information that they obtain about their users, which may include you.



**Q:** _"How private are my details?"_

**A:** We only share personal information about you with third parties whom we have selected carefully and with whom we have, or may have, a commercial relationship. _New Statesman_ complies with the relevant legal requirements and takes all reasonable care to ensure that your information is secure and private and is only seen by responsible third parties. However we cannot be held responsible for the actions of any third party who receives or obtains access to the information, nor for any breach of security. 

If you tell us that you do not want us to use your details, then data about your use of the website would then only form part of aggregated statistics and would not be related to you as an individual. 

**Q:** _"What do I do if I am not happy for you to share information about me with others?"_

**A:** You may not wish us to share personal details about you with third parties outside the _New Statesman_ , or to use your information in the other ways we have described in this Privacy Policy. You can e-mail us at [info@newstatesman.co.uk](mailto:info@newstatesman.co.uk) at any time to let us know of any objections you may have to how we use or disclose your data. In any event your personal details may be shared with third party organisations we have contracted to provide services to us, on an agency basis, which include processing data. We may also have to release information (which could include the contents of e-mail communications between any persons) because of a legal requirement on us or pursuant to a court order. 

**International transfer of personal data**   
As you will know, the internet does not recognise national boundaries. Services on the net are accessible globally so collection and transmission of personal data is not always confined to one country. You should be aware that by using the website and those of our partners or any site we link through to, your personal data may be processed in or transferred to other countries and you agree to your personal data being transferred or processed in this way.
