**NewEnglandFilm.com Privacy Statement**

Updated 01/14/2008

NewEnglandFilm.com. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: [http://www.NewEnglandFilm.com](http://www.nefilm.com/) 

**User Information**

We recognize and respect your need for privacy and security as you visit our site. When you visit our site to view any pages, read product information, or use our online tools, you do so without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. While we do not collect identifying information about visitors to our site, we do use standard software to collect information for the strict purpose of tracking activity on our site. This allows us to better understand how many people use our site and which pages and features are most popular. The only information we normally collect and store is:

The name of your Internet service provider.   
The web site that referred you to us (if any).   
The date and time the pages were accessed.   
The page or pages you requested. 

There are instances where you may elect to provide us with personal information. If you fill out one of our feedback or request forms or send us email, you are transmitting the information that appears to you in the form or the message. This will typically include information like your name, mailing address, email address, the kind of request you are making, and any other information necessary to fulfill your request. You never transmit personally identifying information that you do not enter yourself. And this is always your option; this information cannot be collected unless you specifically elect to send it to us. This information is used internally only for the purpose of fulfilling the request or for contacting you directly and is not given or sold to any other organization.

Our site's industry directory form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and e-mail address). A user's contact information then becomes publicly listed on the web site as part of their listing.  Users may choose to only list an email, a phone or an address -- depending on how they wish to be contacted by other NewEnglandFilm.com users.

Similarly, when users choose to list a classified ad, they must list either their name or company and some form of contact information.  

**Monthly Email Newsletter**

Users have the option to join the NewEnglandFilm.com monthly email update. This is a private and voluntary email list which users may opt-out of at any time using the instructions below.

To unsubscribe from our monthly email, send email to [monthly-update@NewEnglandFilm.com](mailto:monthly-update@NewEnglandFilm.com) with only the word "unsubscribe" in the BODY of your email message.  If you have any problems, [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20080912081626id_/http%3A//www.newenglandfilm.com/contact.htm). 

Our online surveys and contests ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information (like their buying habits). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor only if they are the contest winner. Demographic and profile data collected through these surveys and contests are used for statistical purposes only and are not associated with individuals. As part of all surveys and contests, users may choose to join our email list or not to join.

**Posted Information **

NewEnglandFilm.com cannot be responsible for the accuracy of information posted by users in the classifieds, directory, forum or other sections of the site. 

**Sites We Link To**

This site contains links to other sites. NewEnglandFilm.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
