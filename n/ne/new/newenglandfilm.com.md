**NewEnglandFilm.com Privacy Statement**

NewEnglandFilm.com, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: [http://www.nefilm.com](http://www.nefilm.com/) 

**User Information**

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information.

Our site's **industry directory** form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and e-mail address). A user's contact information then becomes publicly listed on the web site as part of their listing.  Users may choose to only list an email, a phone or an address -- depending on how they wish to be contacted by other NewEnglandFilm.com users.

Similarly, when users choose to list a **classified ad** , they must list either their name or company and some form of contact information.  

**However, if someone is not listed on our site, that person's contact or personal information is never distributed to anyone.**

Users have the option to join the NewEnglandFilm monthly email update. This is a private and voluntary email list which users may opt-out of at any time using the instructions below.

Our site uses an order form for buyers to purchase products and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their e-mail address, mailing address) and financial information (like their credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers. Please note that upon a purchase, the buyer's name, address and phone number is passed along to the seller so that the seller can ship the purchase. Sellers have an agreement with NewEnglandFilm.com to use this personal information only for order shipment and never for any other purpose. Financial information that is collected is only used to check the users' qualifications and bill the user for products and services.

Our online surveys and contests ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information (like their buying habits). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor only if they are the contest winner. Demographic and profile data collected through these surveys and contests are used for statistical purposes only and are not associated with individuals. As part of all surveys and contests, users may choose to join our email list or not to join.
