Newsela - Privacy Policy _[Last Updated: January 11, 2016]_

Here's why we believe in privacy:

Because kids are kids, and they shouldn't have to make grown-up decisions about whom they should trust with their personal information.

Because parents, guardians and the educators with whom they've entrusted their children should have ultimate control over how their children's and students' personal information appears online wherever practicable.

Because passing along personal information to those who shouldn't have it erodes trust. And that's bad for you, for us, and for everyone who believes that technology has the power to help students learn.

This isn't just on us. As adults, we all share responsibility. We're working together with you to help your students and children read closely, think critically and be worldly. We also need to work together to maintain children's most basic online right: the right to privacy. So read our policy. Hold us to it. Make sure your own privacy practices are in order. And let's get this right.

Yours in reading,

Matthew Gross

Additionally, we may share your or your student's personal information with new teachers who use the Services in their classrooms when you or your student, as applicable, enroll in such teachers' classes, and we may share teacher personal information with other teachers within a school using the Services. 

We may create and use anonymized and/or aggregated data for our own purposes by excluding information (such as your or your student's name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you or your student.

We do not sell student personal information.

### INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES

You may "opt-out" of receiving our promotional emails by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your accounts and our transactions with you. You may change some of your or your student's personal information stored in the Services by following the directions on the Site or App. You may send requests about your or your student's personal information, including requests to change your or your student's contact preferences and update or correct your or your student's personal information, to our contact information below. In some cases, changes about a student's personal information may have to be executed by the student's school or teacher, and in such situations, we will attempt to assist you and the school or teacher with such efforts.

When you visit our Site or use our App, we and others give you the following choices about the use of mechanisms for tracking, including tracking of your online activities over time and across different websites and online services by third parties: 

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can typically remove and reject cookies from our Site with your browser settings. If you remove or reject our cookies, it could affect how our Site and Services work for you. You may choose to opt-out of use of cookies by certain third-party analytics providers. 

If you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. 

While we and others give you choices described in this Policy, there are many ways web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and we may not be aware of or honor every mechanism.

### Reliance on Parental Instructions

We may, and you authorize us to, rely on the instructions that we reasonably believe are given by a teacher, parent or legal guardian in connection with a student. For example, if a person calls our customer support number and provides the account information we request, we may assume that the person calling is the teacher, parent or legal guardian of such student. We will not be held liable for any disclosure made in good faith and following reasonable procedures in responding to a request for disclosure of a student' information from such individual.

### SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We encrypt the transmission of your and your student's personal information using security measures designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of personal information against risks through the use of administrative, technological, and physical safeguards.

Despite our efforts, however, third parties may still find ways to hack into the Service and intercept data transmissions. Therefore, although we take security very seriously and work very hard on behalf of your and your student's privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of your or your student's information.
