## NewsCred Website Privacy Policy

Last Updated: April 2013

This privacy policy is intended to inform you about the information that is collected from you when you visit the NewsCred website located at www.newscred.com (the “Website”). Your use of the Website indicates you have read and understood this privacy policy and indicates your agreement to abide by the Terms of Service (TOS) in effect.

### Scope

This privacy policy applies only to the Website. This policy does not apply to information collected through any other website or to the practices of companies that NewsCred does not control. Please note that the Website may contain links to other websites, including social networking sites. We recommend that you read the privacy policies of every website that you visit.

### What Information the Site Collects and How We Use It

NewsCred may collect information from you at several different points on the Website, some of which are automatic and some of which are opt-in.

  * #### Information We Collect Automatically

    1. ##### Types of Information

When you visit and interact with the Website, certain information may be collected automatically, including: 

      1. your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address; 
      2. your browser type and operating system; 
      3. the web pages you were visiting immediately before and after you came to the Website; 
      4. web pages that you view, and links that you click on, within the Website;

      6. standard server log information;
      7. inferred geographic location;

      9. inferred demographic information, such as industry type; and/or
      10. advertisement interaction and viewing data, such as ad click-through rates and information about how many times you viewed a particular ad.

In order to learn more about how our Website is used, we aggregate and analyze the data that we collect. We may use this information, for example, to monitor and analyze use of the Website, to increase our Website's functionality, and to better tailor our content and design to suit our visitors' needs. 

    2. ##### Cookies

We may collect information about your computer, including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration. This is statistical data about how you browse our website.

Cookies help us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more customized service. They enable us:

      1. to estimate usage numbers and patterns;
      2. to store information about your preferences, and to allow us to customize our website according to your individual interests;
      3. to speed up your searches; and
      4. to recognize you when you return to our website.

You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of the website or unable to use some of our services. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you logon to our website.

    3. ##### Log Files

Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.

  * #### Information We Collect When You Opt-In

    1. ##### Newsletter 

NewsCred sends a newsletter that provides subscribers with industry news and intelligence. In order to sign up to receive regular emails via the newsletter, users must submit information including a valid email address. NewsCred may from time to time track user email usage in a continued effort to improve our services. You may opt out of the newsletter at any time using the link at the bottom of the newsletter. 

    2. ##### Product Information

If you request more information about our products by providing your name and email, we may send you the Newsletter, but you can opt-out at any time as described above.

    3. ##### Comment Service

In order to further enhance the user experience, NewsCred runs a comment service powered by Disqus on the NewsCred Blog where users can discuss topics of interest. Users have the option to sign up for this service via either social media or by providing a name and valid email address. NewsCred uses this information to screen out users who leave comments prohibited by our Terms of Service. NewsCred will not pass this information to any other organization except in aggregate form. The comment service uses cookies. Please see Disqus’ privacy policy for more information.




### Business Transitions

In the event NewsCred goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

### Disclosure

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, NewsCred may need to disclose personal information when required by law and/or when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a) a current judicial proceeding, b) a court order or c) legal process served on NewsCred.

If you participate in certain features of this Website (e.g., sharing news stories of interest), please note that any information you voluntarily disclose through use of these features becomes available to the public and/or other users whom you have designated.

If a third party complains that a user comment in our comment service breaches our Terms of Service (e.g. libels them), we will make reasonable efforts to contact the commenter and alert them to the situation, but may have to disclose the commenter’s contact information if required by law to do so. Please refer to our Terms of Service for more information.

### Information Security

NewsCred has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of user information we maintain. Under our security practices and policies, access to personally identifiable information is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access. Although we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is one hundred percent secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information. If you become aware of a security issue, please email us at legal [at] newscred [dot] com. We will work with you to address any problems.

### Notification of Changes 

Whenever NewsCred changes this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this page and change the “Last Updated” date above so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please feel free to send an email to legal [at] newscred [dot] com, call (212) 989-4100 or send a letter by mail to NewsCred, Inc., 27 W. 24th St. Suite 202, New York, NY 10010.
