# NewsOK Privacy Policy | NewsOK.com

## **General Overview**

This website (" **Site** ") or mobile application (" **App** ") is one of several Sites and Apps operated by The Oklahoma Publishing Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates and related companies ("OPUBCO" or "we"). The purpose of this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is to disclose what information we may collect from you when you use the Sites and Apps listed in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use) (collectively, the "Digital Services"), how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such information, including the choices you have regarding our collection of information and our use and disclosure to other parties of information we may have collected from you.

We may collect such information through our Digital Services, as described in our Terms of Use. Terms not otherwise defined here will have the same definitions as set forth in our Terms of Use.

Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you through our Digital Services. For some services, we may collect and transfer personal information to a service provider, or you may visit other merchants or service providers through third-party links in our Digital Services, who may collect and use your personal information for other purposes. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party sites before you disclose your personal information to others.

We may collect information from you in various ways when you use our Digital Services, including but not limited to those described below:

_Registration & Subscriptions._

If you register for a specific feature or service offered within one of our Digital Services, you may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally-identifiable information. You may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Digital Service may offer, including, but not limited to, newsletters, contests, forums, webcasts or other subscription-based services. For some features within our Digital Services, you may be able to log in using a third-party social media account rather than completing a separate registration. If you agree to provide us with optional profile information, this information will typically be collected through a registration form. 

Please keep in mind that if you disclose personally identifiable information through comments to articles, message boards, social media sharing or posting, or other public on-line forums, this information may be collected and used by others accessing those sites. OPUBCO does not monitor or collect information you disclose on any of our public forums nor does it accept any liability associated with your voluntary disclosure of such information.

_Newsletters, Emails and Mobile Offers._

We may offer newsletters and/or other communications in order to share information with you about the Digital Services, about us and our related entities, about our advertisers, sponsors, or other business partners, or relating to topics we believe would be of interest to our readers. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter, or in conjunction with a special feature or subscription for which you have registered using our Digital Services. Each of our Digital Services or newsletters may in some cases require separate registrations. You may cancel your email or other subscription by following the instructions provided by the Digital Service, in the designated area of the newsletters, offers or emails, or as specified in a communication. Some of our Digital Services include a preference menu or page where you can manage all of your email registrations for that Digital Service. You are responsible for all data and other wireless carrier fees associated with your use of our Digital Services.

_Paid Transactions._

Certain transactions within our Digital Services, such as purchasing a paid subscription for The Oklahoman (print and/or digital editions), or purchasing products in our online stores, may require that you enter your name, email, address, payment information, and other details. Our magazine subscription services and store transactions are managed by third party service providers, and the information you provide during these paid transactions is submitted directly to the applicable provider, which in turn may share limited information (such as your name and email address, but not payment account details) with OPUBCO. 

_Contests or Sweepstakes._

We may operate contests and sweepstakes through our Digital Services, which may require registration in order to enter. Your personally-identifiable information may be used by us to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes. Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes. Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Digital Service, such as on a winner’s page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. In some instances, a third-party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Digital Service, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the sponsor, operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser’s or sponsor’s privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.

_Surveys or Voting._

From time-to-time we may request personally-identifiable information from you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information. At times, you may have to register if you wish to vote or to take part in a survey.

_Location; IP Addresses; and Click-stream Data._

Our Digital Services automatically collect certain information from you when you use them. For example, some of our Digital Services use cookies and other similar tracking technologies to provide essential features and improve your experience when using our Digital Services (see below for more information). Additionally, through our Digital Services, our servers or networks may collect your device’s IP address and other device or network information, such as your screen resolution, OS version, browser version, and certain identifiers. 

We may also collect your mailing address (based on information you enter when you subscribe to some of our print publications or Digital Services), or your approximate geo-coded location (based on the zip code you have defined in your mobile device settings, your IP address, your device’s location information (to the extent you have provided our App permission to collect this information), the information relating to the content you view on our sites, or information you provide to us when you subscribe to our Digital Services). You may also choose to input your zip code in order to customize the Content you see, such as local weather reports. 

We also collect click-stream data, including information collected when you request pages from our Digital Services, and may include information such as the page served, the time, the source and type of browser making the request, the most recent page view, what you clicked on in order to arrive at our Site, the content you viewed, and other information. We use this information to help ensure that our content is displayed properly, so that we can understand how, where and which devices access our Digital Services and the content viewed, and to improve the quality and delivery of our Digital Services. We also use this information to analyze how visitors arrive at our Digital Services, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of, content, advertising, and the like. We may associate click-stream, shopping cart, purchase (whether complete or incomplete) and other data described above with other information we hold about you so that we can personalize or improve the relevance and quality of the services or information provided, or for marketing and promotional communications.

_Cookies, tracking, and interest-based advertising._

Our Digital Services may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, and similar digital tracking technologies. Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your hard drive when you visit a website if your browser settings permit the acceptance of cookies. Cookies may enable us to recognize your computer, store your preferences and settings, enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests, perform searches and analytics and assist with security or administrative functions. Similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG, which are opened on a page, ad, or in an email. The request for these files from a server reveals certain information, such as your browser type, IP address, and other information. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information such as ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Digital Services and associated marketing campaigns, and to access user cookies. 

We may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information related to the devices you use to access the Digital Services, such as IP addresses, browser types, browser language, unique device identifiers and other information about your computer(s) and/or mobile device(s). Some tracking technologies on our Digital Services may be provided by a third party (which may be collecting information on its own behalf, or may be providing such information to us). Please note: some cookies/other technologies may track your activities not only on our Digital Services, but on third party sites you visit after you leave our Digital Services, and some services may aggregate this information collected from many sites into a single profile which may be linked or linkable to personal information we hold about you. To learn more about cookies and similar tracking technologies, and how they can affect your privacy, visit [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

For example, Our Digital Services may use cookies or similar technologies provided by third-party website analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us better understand how our Digital Services are used. By tracking how and when you use our Digital Services, these technologies help us determine which features and content on our Digital Services are most important to our visitors. 

Data collected through cookies and similar technology may be also collected by us, our affiliates, or third parties, for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests. We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party websites and viewing of ads and of our content. You may or may not be offered a choice as to whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose. The information collected may include information about your visits to our Digital Services, such as the pages you have viewed. These third-party tracking technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the effectiveness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Digital Services and on third-party websites or services that participate in the ad network, such as websites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad network. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. 

The use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and we disclaim all liability in connection therewith. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Digital Services. 

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can turn off cookies using your browser’s settings menu; however, this may eliminate our ability to provide a personalized or user-friendly experience.

If you wish to take steps to opt-out of tracking by certain online advertisers, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices> or the Network Advertising Initiative at [www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp). Please note, most modern browsers include a “do not track” feature that may help protect your privacy. However, our Site does not respond to your browser’s do-not-track request. 

We internally use personally-identifiable information about our customers to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze Digital Service usage, to improve our Content and product offerings and to customize each Digital Service’s Content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our Digital Services and provide better service to our visitors. We may use a customer’s email address, mailing address or phone number to contact a customer regarding administrative matters or notices, issues with a transaction, satisfaction with the Digital Services and/or our products and services, and along with other information collected through our Digital Services, to provide further information, remarketing, advertising or promotions regarding additional events, products and/or services we believe the customer would be interested in. We may use actual or approximate location information such as your zip code or Geo coded information to select and display advertisements we believe would be of interest based on your location. We may also use information we maintain about a subscriber or other customer to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.

Information we collect may be shared with a variety of parties, depending upon the purpose for which the information was provided and the context in which the information was provided. If you register with or subscribe to a Digital Service, your information may be aggregated and maintained as part of your profile and may be accessed or used by us, including our current or future affiliated and related companies, to provide you with information or marketing communications regarding products or services we think you will be interested in, whether offered by OPUBCO, our affiliated entities, or third parties. We may also share your Personal Information and other information with trusted third parties for marketing, advertising, or other commercial purposes, and we may occasionally allow third parties to access certain Digital Services for marketing purposes. 

We may, without your consent, share Personal Information and other data with service providers who provide certain services on our behalf, or in the other circumstances noted below. For example, we may share certain Personal Information we collect with third parties such as providers of data hosting or processing services, payment processors, or other service providers. We also reserve the right to share any information we possess or data derived from it with service providers or others if such information has been reasonably de-identified.

You may opt-out of having your information shared with third parties as described below under “What choices do I have about collecting, using, and disclosing my information?”

In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of our assets, personal information collected through our Digital Services will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred during the negotiations of such transaction or after the closing thereof.

We may, without your consent, access and disclose your personal information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you as may be permitted or as we believe in good faith may be reasonably necessary to comply with any law, regulation, rule or court order; pursuant to subpoenas or other requests from governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement authorities; to respond to any claims, or to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organizations potentially involved in, or take any action regarding suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Use, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or we believe may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose personal information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property of our users, OPUBCO, or others, if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.

Non-personally identifiable user information (such as usage pattern, browser type and your computer) may be shared with third party businesses or advertisers with which we have a business or contractual relationship. 

It is possible for you to use some of our Digital Services without providing any Personal Information, but you may not be able to access certain features, participate in certain promotions, or view certain content. You may, to the extent such information is shared, opt out of having your information provided to third parties for marketing or other commercial purposes, and opt out of additional marketing or promotional communications from us.

Our Digital Services may feature forums, webcasts and message boards for our users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas, but you may choose to do so.

You should be aware that when you use our Digital Services, you could be directed to other sites beyond our control. For example, if you “click” on an advertisement, you will likely leave the Digital Service and move to a different website that is not operated by us. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use one of our trademarks or brands as part of a co-branding agreement. These other websites may install their own cookies, independently collect data or solicit personal information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you are linked to a third-party website through one of our Digital Services, you should carefully review that third-party site’s privacy policy before providing any personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you submit to third-party websites, including, without limitation, any websites that may be connected to a Digital Service by hypertext link or otherwise.
