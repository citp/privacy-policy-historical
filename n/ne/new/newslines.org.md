**Our legal basis for collecting personal data**

Collecting personal data based on consents

  * The collection of personal data based on consent from the data subject will be done by using “Consent Forms” that will store documentation related to the consent given by the individual. Individual consents will always be stored and documented in our systems.



Collecting personal data based on contracts

  * We use personal information for fulfilling our obligations related to contracts and agreements with customers, partners and suppliers.



Collecting personal data based on legitimate interest

  * We may use personal data if it is considered to be of legitimate interest, and if the privacy interests of the data subjects do not override this interest. Normally, to establish the legal basis for data collection, an assessment has been made during which a mutual interest between us and the individual person has been identified. This legal basis is primarily related to our sales and marketing purposes. We will always inform individuals about their privacy rights and the purpose for collecting personal data.



**What type of personal data is collected?**

  * We collect name, phone number, title and email address and where relevant your company’s name and contact information.

From our voting websites we collect IP-address to ensure votes are individual and genuine.
  * If you upload photos or videos, add posts or comments, etc. on any of our websites, the information can be read by anyone and used for purposes over which we have no control. Therefore The Social News Company Ltd. is not responsible for any of this type of information you submit to any of our websites.
  * If you apply for a job with us, we collect the data you provide during the application process.
  * We do not collect or process any special categories of personal data, such as public unique identifiers or sensitive personal data.



**How we secure, store, retain and delete your data**

  * We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal data we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored. We encrypt personal data provided to us via web forms using up to date standards to prevent others from intercepting the information in transit.
  * We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the services or interaction you have requested and thereafter for a variety of legitimate legal purposes. These might include retention periods: 
    * mandated by law;
    * for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or
    * needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.
  * When the personal data is no longer required we will delete it in a secure manner
  * We may process data for statistical purposes, but in such cases, data will be anonymized.
