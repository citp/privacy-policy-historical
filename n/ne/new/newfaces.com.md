New Faces is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. We believe it is important you know how we treat the information about you we receive via the Internet.

In general, you can visit New Faces on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information may be aggregated on a "no names" basis to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. New Faces uses this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site.

There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. When information is needed, we will let you know at the time of collection, how we will use the personal information. Usually, the personal information we collect is used only by us to respond to your inquiry, process an order or allow you to access specific account information.

New Faces makes every effort to maintain the security of its network and the data we collect. Any data that is stored on New Faces's server is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. New Faces has a strict internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who have a need to know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering New Faces products and services.

New Faces is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children surfing the web.

At times we conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs and profile of our visitors. When we conduct a survey, we will try to let you know how we will use the information at the time we collect information from you on the Internet.
