According to Code, processing by Register.it will conform to the principles of fairness, lawfulness, transparency and of protecting your privacy and your rights.

**Purpose of processing**  
Any processing we do is to support the provision of Services requested by the user. Moreover, data will be processed to discharge any legal, accounting, or tax obligations. Personal data can also be processed to enable navigation of the Site and assist in viewing Register.it websites.   
Our processing involves collecting, storing, and entering your personal data for the purposes of statistical analysis to verify the quality of the services offered; this is conducted in an anonymous and/or aggregate way, without the possibility of identifying the user.   
Finally, the data can also be processed – provided the user gives explicit consent – for marketing and advertising and in order to provide information and/or offers for products, services, or initiatives that are offered or promoted by Register.it by companies that are part of the Dada Group and/or affiliated and/or controlled companies, such as business partners and outsourcers, without resulting in the disclosure of personal data to third parties. 

**Processing procedures**  
Your personal data will be primarily processed using electronic or automated tools. 

**Your personal data may be communicated to:**  
1\. persons, companies or professional offices that provide assistance and advice to Register.it for the purposes of accounting, administrative, legal, tax and financial issues related to the provision of Services;  
2\. individuals, entities or authorities for whom the communication of your personal data is required by law or by order of the authorities ;  
3\. individuals authorized and/or appointed by Register.it to carry out activities strictly related to the provision of Services or individuals authorized and/or appointed by Register.it to carry out technical maintenance activities (including the maintenance of network equipment and/or the electronic communications network);  
In addition, personal data may be communicated to individuals and/or classes of individuals in their capacity as Data Processors (if appointed) or Persons in Charge of the Processing, including: Dada Group companies, Italian or abroad, and Dada Group employees responsible for administrative and/or technical management of the Services or the IT platform through which the Services are provided.  
With regard to the scope of dissemination, the personal data required to activate the Services will not be disseminated. 

**Optional and mandatory consent**  
While providing personal data for Service activation is optional. However, any missing information could render it impossible to activate the requested Services.  
Consenting to the processing of personal data is optional and in no way mandatory for the following activities: sending advertising materials and information; carrying out direct sales or placing products or services; sending business-related information. 

**Future processing of personal third-party data supplied by the Data Subject**  
If you provide or otherwise process the personal data of third parties using the Service, you guarantee in advance – under assumption of all related liability – that this will be conducted with the prior consent of the third party whose information is being processed.

**Navigation data**  
Over the course of normal use, the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Register.it Site collect some personal information that is automatically transmitted during the routine use of Internet communication protocols. This information is not collected for the purposes of being associated with specific individuals; however, its very nature means it could be used to identify users via processing and association with data held by third parties.  
The data in this category includes IP addresses and domain names of the computers with which the users are connected to the site, the requested resource URI addresses (Uniform Resource Identifier), the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the number code indicating the status of the server data response (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters associated with the operating system and the computer environment of the user.  
However, this data is used for the sole purposes of collecting anonymous statistical data on the use of the site and verifying that the site is functioning correctly; after processing, it is immediately erased. The data could also be used to ascertain responsibility in the event of computer crimes that damage the Site or third parties. However, with the exception of the aforementioned scenario, web contact data is not saved permanently, other than at the user's request (for example, accessing the personal page of the user within Register.it that lists the services used, published information, etc).  
In terms of cookies or user-tracking/monitoring systems, accessing the Site could result in text files being sent – from our servers to the computer of the user – to obtain information about site navigation. Under Article 122 of the Privacy Code, we inform you that sending non-persistent cookies is required for some parts of the service that rely on identifying the path that the user takes through different pages, including: the type of browser (for example, Internet Explorer, Netscape), the operating system (for example, Windows, Apple), the host and source URL of the visitor and the information about the page requested. This data could be used in an aggregate and anonymous form for statistical analysis about site use. Finally, the use of so-called session cookies (which are not permanently stored on the user’s computer and disappear when the browser closes) is strictly limited to identifying session transmissions (random numbers generated by the server) necessary for safe and effective site navigation.   
You can simply and easily de-active cookies through the browser-setting options. This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files that are stored on your computer, to allow the website to analyze how the site is being used. The information the cookies generate about your website use (including your IP address) is sent to and stored on Google servers in the United States. Google uses this information to track and examine website use and compile a website activity report for the website operator, in addition to providing other services related to website management and Internet use. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required by law or where third parties process the aforementioned information on Google’s behalf. Google does not associate your IP address with any other data in its possession. You can refuse to accept cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser; however, this may prevent you from using all the features on the website. By using this website you consent to the processing of your data by Google for the purposes indicated above.
