The collected personal identification information is used for the purpose it was submitted for and NewCars.com own marketing. At the first time of any first marketing contact between NewCars.com and the prospect, NewCars.com offers individuals a choice as to whether or not they would like to receive marketing in form of newsletters etc. from NewCars.com.
