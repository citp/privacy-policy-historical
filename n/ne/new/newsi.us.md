Many features on this web site require that a user register. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as email address and password). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which (s)he has expressed an interest.

## Information Use

### Profile

We store and gather information from cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their preferences and actions. Collected information is tied to a user's identity to provide offers and improved content. This profile is used to tailor a users visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties.

### Third Party Advertising

We do not pass personal information to those advertisers about our users -- although those advertisers may choose to use technologies that allow them to connect a user's presence on our site with the same user's presence on other sites. This is standard practice by some advertisers, and is in no way unique to SepticSystem.com. 

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.SepticSystem.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

This information allows us to link your ip address to any personally identifiable information that you have given us. 

## Communications from the Site

### Offers and Updates

### Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.
