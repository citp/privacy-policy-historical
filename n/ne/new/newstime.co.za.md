         that third parties may not be able to link such profiles and statistical data to You.
         You hereby indemnify the Owner against any loss, liability, expense, claim, penalty

                  audits. This information (as well as information from third-party market
                  researchers), on an aggregated, anonymous basis, is provided to advertisers
                  advertising on the Web Site. Should You provide personal information online
                  as part of an online advertising promotion or in order to access a third party
                  service, such information may be provided directly to the advertiser or the

         5.2.3    Promotions: many promotions offer opportunities to request additional
                  information from sponsors or third parties. When You request more

                  tracking information, cookies, credit card number and contact information)
                  is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place;
         5.2.5    Third parties: online merchants providing services in association with the
                  Owner have separate privacy and data collection practices. You agree that
                  the Owner has no responsibility or liability for third party policies. For more

                editorial purposes. For example, this may include information You provide

        5.2.7   Legal: the Owner may also disclose Your personal information in special
                cases, where the Owner has reason to believe that such disclosure is
                necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against a party who may
                be breaching the Terms and Conditions or may be causing injury to or
                interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the Owner(s) rights
                or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such
                activities; and
        5.2.8   For statistics and advertisement purposes: the Owner may perform
                statistical analyses in order to measure interest in the various areas of the
                Web Site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to
                how many consumers have seen or "clicked" on their advertising banners.
                The Owner also uses demographic information to allow advertising banners
                on the Web Site to be targeted, in aggregate.
6. WHAT ARE COOKIES AND HOW ARE THEY USED?
    6.1 Cookies are pieces of information a Web Site transfers to a user(s) hard drive for
        record-keeping purposes. Cookies make surfing the web easier for You by saving
        Your preferences and, tracking Your online habits, traffic patterns, and making sure
        You do not see the same advertisement too often. The use of cookies is an industry
        standard.
    6.2 The Owner may place a "cookie" on Your browser to store and sometimes track
        information about You.

        browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please, note
        that some parts of the Web Site will not function properly if You refuse cookies. For
        example, without cookies, You will not be able to set personalized TV Guide
        preferences. You may occasionally get cookies from third party advertisers. The
        Owner does not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-
        party advertisers is an industry standard.
7. USE OF IP ADDRESS
    7.1 An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer whenever it
        is connected to the Internet. The Owner also logs IP addresses, or the location of
        computers on the Internet. The Owner collects IP addresses for the purposes of
        system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to
        audit the use of the Web Site. The Owner does not ordinarily link IP addresses to
        personal information, which means that Your session may remain anonymous.
        However, the Owner cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. For
        example, it may be necessary to identify a particular user when it is necessary to
        enforce compliance with the Terms and Conditions or to protect our service Web
        Site, customers or other interests.

        policies of any advertisers, sponsors or other third party web sites.

        the utmost concern to us. While the Owner exercises great care in providing secure
        transmission of Your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet
