# Privacy ⋆ WayneDupree.com

This document describes the privacy practices of WayneDupree.com (the “Privacy Policy”).

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you, including information gathered when you visit the website located at WayneDupree.com/Newsninja2012.com, the campaign’s social media pages, the campaign’s mobile site or downloadable mobile applications (collectively, the “Site”), and information we may receive from third parties or affiliates, how we may use that information, whether we disclose that information to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of visitors to our website.

By using the Site, you consent to the use and disclosure of information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulations establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our sites to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested.

We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you (“Personally Identifiable Information”). We also may collect information that by itself typically cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (e.g., age, profession or gender), IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Site (“Non- Personally Identifiable Information”).

When you make a contribution through our Site, any credit card information provided is only used to immediately process your donation. We do not retain your credit card information once the donation is processed. Wayne Dupree.com/Newsninja2012.com has adopted security measures to protect your financial information. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving financial data from our site.

We use log files and Google Analytics to assess the aggregate level of traffic on WayneDupree.com/Newsninja2012.com, including what pages people are visiting, and to diagnose any potential problems with the Site. This log file contains an IP address that gives us insight on the general geographic area of visitors but not information on a specific individual. We do not use log files to track a particular individual’s use of our site. Google Analytics will place cookies on your computer that will generate information that we select about your use of the Site, including your computer’s IP address. That information will be transmitted to and stored by Google. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Please note that by doing so, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site. The use of cookies by Google Analytics is covered by Google’s privacy policy. All users remain anonymous unless they choose to give us personally identifiable information.

Our site contains opportunities for a visitor to share content, and messages to friends and family. Some features of our site may allow you to store addresses for easy retrieval and reuse at a later time. This information is stored for your convenience. We use cookies to personalize and customize your interaction on our site, and to provide you with the best possible online experience.

This site may include very small files provided by one or more online advertising networks that help them more precisely to target advertising to users, based on users’ activity on sites within those networks. These files do not access or use information by which users can be personally identified. If you wish, you can prevent these files from using non-personal information about you by either deleting the cookie folder in your browser or by putting your browser’s Privacy setting higher, but doing so will mean that you will not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our, and other, websites — and may well adversely affect your experience of websites that use cookies to enhance or personalize that experience. For more information about digital advertising, or to opt out of targeted ads, visit: https://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

Personally Identifiable Information we collect may include your name, email addresses, postal addresses, ZIP code, telephone number, credit card information, date of birth, gender, age, user name and password, and other information either desirable or necessary to provide quality services to our customers and visitors.

To the extent we are able to do so, we may link your Non-Personally Identifiable Information with your Personally Identifiable Information. We may also link information collected online with information we collect offline or that is collected online by third parties.

WayneDupree.com/NewsNinja2012.com may provide or sell your email address or other personal information to third parties for fundraising or other purposes. Additionally, we may share your personal information with select third parties who offer goods or services we think may be of interest to you. From time to time, we may partner with other organizations or companies to provide co-sponsored or co-branded promotions, services or events and may share your personal information with our co-sponsor(s) and partners. Additionally, WayneDupree.com/NewsNinja2012.com may provide your personal information to service providers or contractors to perform functions on its behalf, such as, but not limited to, companies or individuals hired to communicate news, deliver our promotional materials via e-mail and direct mail, promote our social media presence and activities, to process credit card payments and to assist us with sending communications and performing other marketing and support functions. Also, we may use third-party social media platforms, including third-party social media websites, to communicate with you.

We also may share with third parties aggregated demographic and statistical information that is not personally identifiable.

WayneDupree.com/NewsNinja2012.com also may disclose an individual’s personal information:

  * to a person who in our reasonable judgment is seeking the information as an agent of the individual;
  * in situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in order to offer you products or services you desire;
  * to a third party or parties, where disclosure is required or permitted by law; and
  * if, in our reasonable judgment, it is necessary enforce compliance with our internal policies or the Terms of Use or to protect our Site, supporters, or others.



We may be required to use or disclose your information in connection with a legal action or other proceeding, including without limitation, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request.

After your information reaches us, however, it is stored on servers (or in the case of information received from you in person, in writing or over the phone, in physical storage areas) protected by procedures and technology designed to block reasonably foreseeable intrusions by unauthorized third parties.

Your browser and other mechanisms may permit you to send do-not-track signals or other similar signals to express your preferences regarding online tracking. To the extent you employ such browser do-not-track signals or other similar mechanisms, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor such requests received by us to the extent we have the capacity and resources to identify and process your request. Due to the potential for rapid and diverse developments of technology in this area, we cannot guarantee that we can process every type of request that exists or may be developed in the future. As noted above, third parties, such as our advertising partners, may collect data that relates to you. We cannot control third parties’ responses to do-not-track signals or other such mechanisms. Third parties’ use of data relating to you and responsiveness to do-not-track signals is governed by their respective privacy policies.
