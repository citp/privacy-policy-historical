## Privacy Policy

Welcome to www.newwest.net (the "Website") operated by New West Publishing LLC ("New West", "We", "Us" or "Our"). This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") is designed to assist you in understanding how collect, use, and retain personally identifiable information ("PII") you provide to Us through the Website, and to assist you in making informed decisions when using the Website. This Policy may be updated in Our sole discretion in consideration of new business practices, technologies, and the needs of members of the public who visit the Website ("Visitors") and Visitors who submit material to the Website or otherwise provide Us with certain PII and who are thirteen (13) years of age or older ("Members"). If we make any material changes to the Policy, we will promptly post such changes.   
The Website follows these principles in collecting and managing PII:

  

  * **We collect PII from individuals only as allowed by law.**
  
We limit the collection of PII to what is relevant and necessary to accomplish a lawful purpose of the Website. For example, in order for a Member to submit content to the Website, we request that the Member provide Us with certain PII, like their name and e-mail address. We do not collect any PII from Visitors who browse our Website and who do not wish to submit any information. We collect PII about you only if you provide it to Us voluntarily through the Website. 
  * **We tell visitors who provide PII to the Website the purpose for which the information is collected.**
  
We collect PII of Members who submit materials to the Website in order to contact such Members regarding their submissions if We so desire. We may also send Members certain communications, such as announcements or administrative messages, for marketing or other purposes. 
  * **We tell people who provide PII about their opportunity to modify or remove their PII from Our system.**
  
By contacting us at privacyofficer@newwest.net, you may request (i) to modify any of your PII at any time, (ii) to remove your PII from Our database, or (iii) to not be contacted by Us. 
  * **We use PII only for the specified purposes, or purposes consistent with those purposes, unless We get your consent or unless required by law or regulation.**
  
We will not sell, lease, or otherwise disclose your PII to third parties without your consent, provided that We may share your PII with third parties under certain circumstances, including: a) if sharing your PII is necessary to execute a specific request by you; however, in these specific cases, third parties will not retain, share, or store any PII except to provide the specific services requested by you; b) if sharing your PII is required by law; is necessary to respond to a subpoena, warrant, or court order; or is necessary to protect the rights of the Website or its visitors; or c) if you give us explicit permission to share your PII with third parties.   
New West may share demographic information with third parties on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without disclosing your identity), subject to this Policy. One of the reasons that we may do this is to improve the Website’s effectiveness. 
  * **We use information security safeguards.**
  
We take commercially reasonable precautions to protect the PII of Members collected or maintained by the Website against loss, unauthorized access, and illegal use or disclosure. PII is stored in secure locations.
  *  **We may use "cookies" to obtain anonymous and aggregate information about your use of the Website.**
  
We may use cookies to personalize your use of the Website. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. They facilitate the delivery of desired content to Members or Visitors, thereby assisting website navigation. Accepting cookies that may be used by Us does not give Us access to your PII, but such cookies may be used to identify your computer. You have the ability to modify your web browser to decline cookies if you so choose. We may also use other types of technology, like web beacons or action tags, to compile statistics about general use of this Website. 
  * **We do not collect PII from children under the age of thirteen (13) years of age.**
