<p><strong>Commitment</strong>
</p>
<dl><dd> We have written this Privacy Policy to demonstrate and preserve our firm commitment to protect your personal privacy. The staff of this website (Newzbin) consists of entirely ordinary people, and we are no less concerned about our own privacy, as we are about yours. The following text discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our website. If you have any queries, you may talk to a member of staff via the secure contact form.
</dd></dl>
<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong>
</p>
<dl><dd> An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a set of numbers assigned to you by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) during the time that you are online. Every website you visit has access to this information, due to the way the Internet works. This is nothing to worry about, as all websites need your IP in order to discern where they have to send the information to. It is possible for sites to personally identify you via your IP address, but that is only if you volunteer the information in the first place. We (Newzbin) only records IP addresses for the usage of statistics and to help with the general debugging of the website. We will never try to identify you by your IP, except in certain circumstances that warrant it, such as helping you with a problem, or if we suspect that your activities on our website are not within legal boundaries (as per the Terms of Service / Disclaimer.)
</dd></dl>
<p><strong>Email Addresses</strong>
</p>
<dl><dd> We require proper email addresses for an account signup mainly due to security reasons, and once provided, it is kept on file to link your email address to your account name. This information never leaves the boundaries of the site's database, and you can be assured that only you and the staff have access to that information. We have implemented a feature on the site that allows users to send fellow users an email via the site. If the choose to do this, their email address is revealed, so that the recipient user may reply to that email. This information will only be revealed should the user choose to send an email, otherwise, it is hidden from the public. We are firm in our commitment to especially protect critical information, such as your email address, from those who would use it for monetary gain. Therefore, we urge you not to reveal your email address to anyone on the site, even those with higher privileges (such as Global Editors) - Your information will remain safe unless you willing give that information out.
</dd></dl>
<p><strong>External Links</strong>
</p>
<dl><dd> Within the site, various external links may be present to sites that we do not own, and therefore have no control over. We do not necessarily admonish or support the privacy practices of these sites, and cannot be held responsible for neither the content, nor the privacy practices. We urge you to be careful when clicking on external URLs, and if you do find an uncrupulous link upon the site, feel free to report your findings to us, and we will deem whether it is necessary to remove the link.
</dd></dl>
<p><strong>Public Forums</strong>
</p>
<dl><dd> We may or may not provide message boards and comments systems to our members and the general public. Please remember that any information within these areas becomes Public Domain, and you should therefore exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information. In fact, we highly frown on such practices that are not within private boundaries. We cannot be held responsible for protecting the privacy of any information that you willingly choose to disclose upon the site. You do so at your own risk.
</dd></dl>
<p><strong>Security</strong>
</p>
<dl><dd> One thing we are proud of is our dedication to site security, and doing as much as physically possible to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access or alteration. Please bear in mind that we cannot guarantee under all circumstances that loss, misuse, unauthorised access or alteration to data will never occur. Therefore, we will not be held responsible should any of the aforementioned occur.
</dd></dl>
<p><strong>Afterword</strong>
</p>
<dl><dd> We (Newzbin) will never stoop to making a quick and dirty buck/pound/euro by changing the privacy practices to benefit ourselves in a monetary way. We trust you to use our site as much as we hope that you trust us with your information. On that note, please enjoy the site.
