# Privacy Policy | New Adventures In Web Design conference | Nottingham | 20th January 2011

This site uses HTML5 and CSS3 to do some pretty modern things. We're no longer living in the past, and browsers like this one (Internet Explorer 6) are very, very out of date. So, you get this stripped-down, boring version. To get around this, upgrade, or download Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome or Opera. Think of the children.
