**By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, our website has agreed to inform you on:**

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours Newegg.com collects.
  2. The organization collecting the information.
  3. How the information is used.
  4. With whom the information may be shared.

**Information Collection and Use**  
Newegg.com ("Us" or "We") is the sole owner of information collected on this site to purchase most products and services from Newegg.com (refer to the next paragraph for the limited exceptions to this). We will not sell, share, or rent this information to any third parties, except as outlined in this policy. We collect information from our customers to process orders and better serve you with pertinent information, such as order confirmations, order status updates, and to provide you with information on products and services that are available from us or parties associated with us. We may also use such information to better understand the shopping experiences of you individually or in conjunction with a group of our customers. Information collected includes your name, shipping address, billing address, telephone numbers, e-mail address, and payment information such as your credit card number. We also require you to submit a username and password of your choice for your future access to your account information. To safeguard that your user name and password remain confidential, DO NOT share this information with anyone. If you elect to receive our newsletter, surveys, or special promotions, your contact information will be used for the delivery of these items. However, if you elect not to receive newsletters, surveys, or special promotions, we may still periodically send other transactional communications to you that contain customer relationship information. This includes, for example, informational emails regarding changes in our policies, changes in our methods of conducting business, or requesting that you review the information we have on file for you or the options that you have previously selected regarding your transactions with us. 

We may also gather or receive information on you from third party sources, such as marketing databases made available for commercial purchase. Our use of such information will comply with applicable law, the limitations imposed by the third party on us in connection with our receipt of such information from such third party sources, but not necessarily this privacy statement. 

For certain services, Newegg.com has agreements with select third party business partners in order to provide our customers with additional services that we otherwise do not offer. Such services include wireless communication services. In these cases, we collect certain information from you to send to the third party service provider in order to activate or upgrade your account with the service provider. We do not provide any of your information to the third party service provider unless you first consent. Any information that we provide to the third party service provider with your consent is owned by that service provider, and it may use your information for service approval, activation, upgrade and for other purposes that it requires. You should consult the privacy policies of the respective third party service providers, since this Newegg.com Privacy Policy does not cover the use of your information in these limited circumstances. 

In addition, from time to time we may provide you with chances to enter into sweepstakes or contests. We conduct these sweepstakes and contests in partnership with select third parties. When you enter, we collect certain personal information from you, and as a condition of entry, you typically must agree to allow us to share your information with the third party in order to allow the third party to manage the prize fulfillment process on our behalf. Otherwise, we do not provide your information to the third party. 

**Registration**  
In order to process your orders placed on this website, you must first complete the registration form. During registration, you will be required to provide your contact information, which includes your name, e-mail address, telephone number and street address. This information is used to provide you with important Newegg.com services such as automated order status updates via e-mail. 

**Order**  
Most of the information collected in the registration process will be used to process orders. During the order process, you will have to provide financial information such as your credit card number, expiration date, money order, wire transfer or check information. This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill your order. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this contact information to get in touch with you. To properly process your credit card information, we must share your personal and financial information with the merchant bank for authorization and approval. This process is protected by an enhanced security system. See the Security section below for more details on security measures and procedures. We do not share your personal and financial information with any third parties, except those specified in the Sharing section of this policy. 

**Cookies**  
We customize certain Web page content based upon your browser type and other information provided by our cookie. If you choose to reject the cookie, you can still browse our store but will be unable to use the shopping cart to buy merchandise. The Newegg.com shopping cart cannot function without cookies enabled so that the necessary information to process your order is retained. If you disable cookies, Newegg.com will be unable to accept your online order. We will not share any personally identifiable information provided by this cookie with any third party. We will, however, link data stored in cookies to the personally identifiable information you submitted while on our site. This allows us to personalize your shopping experience and discern user preferences to evoke subconscious feelings of familiarity and assurance. 

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. 

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Newegg.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information, and we do not distribute or share IP information with any third parties. 

**Sharing**  
We may employ third party companies to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include order fulfillment, package delivery, marketing assistance, postal and e-mail delivery, customer service, data analysis, and credit processing. The third parties we contract for these purposes have limited access to your personal information and may not use it for other purposes. Among such third parties are the three referenced immediately below.

Also, as set forth above in the "Information Collection and Use" section, for certain services Newegg.com has agreements with select third party business partners in order to provide our customers with additional services that we otherwise do not offer. Such services include wireless communication services and sweepstakes and contests. In these cases, and only with your advance consent, we will share information collected from you with the third party service provider in order to allow the service provider to activate or upgrade your account or in order to manage the prize fulfillment process. For the wireless services, the third party service providers' respective privacy policies, and not this Newegg.com Privacy Policy, will apply to their handling of the information shared in these circumstances. 

In addition, we may frame or mask another web site so that the look, feel and interface simulate the experience of browsing a genuine Newegg.com web page. Care and discretion is exercised when evaluating third party sites. We only brand third party sites if their organization applies security and privacy practices which we view are reasonably consistent, where appropriate, to our own commitment to safe online shopping. 

As our business continues to evolve, we may acquire or sell business units or subsidiaries. Customer information is one of the business assets that would be transferred in these types of transactions. In such a situation, your personally identifiable information would only be used in a manner consistent with our pre-existing Privacy Notice. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information i) as required by law, ii) when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site, iii) when we believe that your actions violate applicable laws, iv) when we believe that your actions violate Newegg.com's terms and conditions that you agree to by using, accessing or purchasing from or through [ www.newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com/) (or its affiliated websites), v) when we believe that your actions violate any usage guidelines for specific products or services, vi) when we believe that your actions violate or threaten the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others, or (vii) when you consent to allow your personally identifiable information to be shared or disclosed. 

Be aware that when you volunteer information or create a public profile in the course of your participation in our community features such as forums, user opinions and reviews, chat rooms, photo sharing or other forms of public communication and interaction, you are also agreeing to allow certain aspects of your personally identifiable information to be made public. This includes your screen name, any address or personal information or images that you add to your signature or otherwise post to the public, and any content of any such post. 

Finally, if you have elected to allow us to share your personally identifiable information at the time that you registered with us or provided us the information, or through a subsequent affirmative election through our website, we may later disclose such information to others in compliance with your election and this privacy statement. 

**Third Party Service Providers Disclosure**  
We use PayPal to facilitate our order and payment processing. When you place an order, you may be automatically transferred to PayPal's web site. Please be aware that their privacy policy governs the use and collection of your personally identifiable information and is shared with us to fulfill the order.
