</header><div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>This Privacy Policy outlines important information regarding the use and disclosure of information collected via this Website. NewsAndPromotions.com provides this Privacy Policy to help users make an informed decision as to whether to use or continue using the Website. PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. NewsAndPromotions.com DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO NewsAndPromotions.com OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to NewsAndPromotions.com collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by NewsAndPromotions.com on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the Website), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to NewsAndPromotions.com other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. NewsAndPromotions.com is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.</p>
<p>By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Website Terms of Use. Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide via the Website or through other official NewsAndPromotions.com contact remains subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as the Terms of Use and/or other stated policies.</p>
<p>1. Collection of Information.</p>
<p>1.1 Survey Information.</p>
<p>NewsAndPromotions.com collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an NewsAndPromotions.com survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a Survey). (As used herein, online means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and offline means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, NewsAndPromotions.com or a third party (a Third Party) may ask an individual to provide various information to NewsAndPromotions.com, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, Survey Information). NewsAndPromotions.com may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to NewsAndPromotions.com or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from NewsAndPromotions.com or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to NewsAndPromotions.com.</p>
<p>1.2 Third Party List Information.</p>
<p>NewsAndPromotions.com collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and NewsAndPromotions.com subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the Seller). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual’s name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, Third Party List Information). When acquiring Third Party List Information, NewsAndPromotions.com seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to NewsAndPromotions.com and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller’s list.</p>
<p>1.3 Other Information.</p>
<p>Other occasions when NewsAndPromotions.com obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by NewsAndPromotions.com or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through NewsAndPromotions.com customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a NewsAndPromotions.com service or newsletter (together, Other Information).</p>
<p>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</p>
<p>NewsAndPromotions.com currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, NewsAndPromotions.com may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, Technology Information).</p>
<p>(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual’s computer that allows NewsAndPromotions.com to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in NewsAndPromotions.com database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com . Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Website.</p>
<p>(b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function — see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows NewsAndPromotions.com to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, NewsAndPromotions.com might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party’s website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in NewsAndPromotions.com database, visits the baseball website, NewsAndPromotions.com receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and NewsAndPromotions.com would then update Joe’s profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball. NewsAndPromotions.com may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, NewsAndPromotions.com also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in NewsAndPromotions.com database.</p>
<p>(c) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is NewsAndPromotions.com use of new and evolving technology. As a result, NewsAndPromotions.com strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>

<p>1.7 No Information Collected from Children. NewsAndPromotions.com will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If NewsAndPromotions.com obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, NewsAndPromotions.com has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties.

<p>1.8 Credit Card Information.</p>

NewsAndPromotions.com will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.
