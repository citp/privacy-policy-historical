#### Privacy

The Publisher recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about its customers and takes your privacy very seriously. For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, the word customers includes visitors to the Publisher’s Site(s), subscribers to and users of its services, purchasers of its products and advertising customers. This privacy policy is intended to inform you about the information that is collected from you when you visit the Site, how this information may be used and disclosed, how you can control the use and disclosure of your information, and how your information is protected. The Publisher may, from time to time, review and update this policy, including taking account of new or amended laws, new technology and/or changes to its operations. This privacy policy applies only to the Site. This policy does not apply to information collected through any other website or to the practices of companies that the Publisher does not control. Please note that the Site may contain links to other websites. For example, if you click on an advertisement on the Site and link to another website, then this privacy policy will not apply to any information collected on that website.

All personal information held by the Publisher will be governed by the most recently updated policy.

#### Personal Information

The Publisher collects personal information when the Publisher provides its services to you. When you visit and interact with the Site, certain information may be collected automatically, including: 

• your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address;  
• your browser type and operating system;  
• the web pages you were visiting immediately before and after you came to the Site;  
• activities within community discussions;  
• web pages and advertisements that you view, and links that you click on, within the Site;

• aggregated data about email click-through rates and user video viewing;  
• standard server log information; and  
• information collected through HTML cookies, Flash cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. 

The Publisher usually collects personal information directly from you, although sometimes the Publisher may use agents or service providers to do this for the Publisher. The Publisher may also acquire lists from other sources, both from other companies and from other public documents. This may include advertisers, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business partners. The Publisher may also access information about you from third-party sources and platforms (such as social networking sites, databases, online marketing firms, and ad targeting firms), including: 

• if you access third-party social networking services (such as Facebook Connect or Twitter) through the Site, your username and connection lists for those services;  
• demographic data, such as age range, gender, and interests;  
• advertisement interaction and viewing data, such as ad click-through rates and information about how many times you viewed a particular ad; and  
• unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law.

Please note that the Site may combine the information that we collect with information that the Publisher may obtain from third-party sources. The Publisher may collect your personal information when you request or acquire a product or service from the Publisher, register with the Publisher as a member (including user name and password and contact information such as name, email address, postal address, phone number, and mobile number), provide a product or service to the Publisher, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition or event, contribute in a fundraising event, participate in one of the Publisher’s services (including blogs, forums, community discussions and other interactive features), search queries conducted on the Site, or when you communicate with the Publisher by e-mail, telephone, or in writing. If, at any time, you provide personal information about someone other than yourself, you warrant that you have that person’s consent to provide such information for the purpose specified.

#### Use of Information

The Publisher usually collects personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, and in some instances, your financial details, including your credit card information. The Publisher also collects information about you that is not personal information. For example, the Publisher may collect data relating to your activity on its websites (including IP addresses) via tracking technologies such as cookies, or the Publisher may collect information from you in response to a survey. The Publisher generally uses this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer its services, diagnose problems and target and improve the quality of its products and services. By continuing to access the Site, you agree that the Publisher may use this information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever, and you agree that the Publisher may use your mobile number to send you promotions, notifications, or other services.   
When you are online, the Publisher collects information regarding the pages within its network which you visit and what you click on. As a general rule the Publisher does not collect sensitive information, however it reserves the right to do so. If the Publisher does, it will usually be for the purposes of providing its goods or services and if the law requires the Publisher to, the Publisher will seek your consent to collect it.

The Publisher uses your information to provide its services (which may include the display of personalised content and advertising) to you, to fulfil administrative functions associated with these services, for example billing, to enter into contracts with you or third parties and for marketing and client relationship purposes. In order to provide our readers with free access to our content, we display advertisements on the Site, many of which are targeted based on information about you. For example, using information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other sources, the Publisher may use demographic data or information about your online activities or interests to display targeted advertising that may be relevant to your preferences. Through this process, advertisers reach Site visitors who are most interested in their products, and you see advertising for products or services in which you may be interested. Third-party advertisers and advertising platforms also may serve targeted ads on the Site. Please remember that the information practices of third-party advertisers or platforms collecting data on our Site are not covered by this privacy policy. The Publisher may also use the information that it collects to prevent illegal activities, to enforce the Site's Terms and Conditions, and to otherwise protect its rights and the rights of its Users. In addition to the uses identified above, the Publisher may use the information that it collects for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time it collects your information or pursuant to your consent. Where your personal information is contained within an advertisement which the Publisher publishes for you, the Publisher may also use your information for publication of that same advertisement in other media, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the initial publication. The Publisher may share your information with other companies which are related to the Publisher. The Publisher may also use your personally identifiable information to assist the Publisher in improving its products and services and any of the Publisher’s or its related companies might be in touch to let you know about goods, services, or promotions which may interest you.

#### Use by Third Parties

The Publisher values your privacy, and shares information about its users only under certain circumstances. The Publisher may disclose your information to its service providers and contractors from time to time to help the Publisher to provide and market its goods and services to you. The Publisher may also share your information with third parties who provide prizes for competitions or reader offers. If the Publisher does this, the Publisher generally requires these parties to protect your information in the same way as the Publisher does.

The Publisher will make information about you available to other companies, applications, or people in the circumstances listed below:   
• The Publisher may share aggregated information or information that does not directly identify you with third parties to help the Publisher develop content, services, and advertising that the Publisher hopes you will find of interest. Please note that the Publisher does not share contact information with third parties that advertise on the Site.  
• The Publisher may employ third parties to perform Site-related services, including database management, maintenance services, analytics, marketing, data processing, and email and text message distribution. These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on the Publisher’s behalf.  
• If you choose to engage in public activities on the site, such as posting comments on community message boards, any information you submit can be read, collected, or used by others. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in public activities or submissions.  
• The Publisher may share information about you in the event that the Site is acquired by or merged with another company or a similar corporate transaction takes place. However, the Site will notify you by placing a prominent notice on the Site or sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account before your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.  
• The Publisher may share information about you to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety or other rights and interests of any person, violations of the Site's Terms and Conditions, or as otherwise required by law.  
• The Publisher may share information about you to respond to subpoenas, search warrants, judicial proceedings, court orders, legal process, or other law enforcement measures, to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.  
• In addition to the scenarios identified above, the Publisher may share information about you for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time the Publisher collects your information or pursuant to your consent.

Please note that third parties may independently collect data about you, including your IP address and information about the websites you visit and the links you click, through cookies, clicks on links, or other means when you visit or view ads on the Site. To customize your experience on the Site and to simplify the Site's registration process, the Publisher provides you with the opportunity to access or interact with third-party services, such as Facebook and Twitter. When you connect to the Site through these third-party services, the Publisher may share information about you with these third-party service providers and they may share data about you with the Publisher. When you allow the Publisher to access your data through a third-party service to create a Site profile, the Publisher may use this data for several purposes, including:   
• For example, if you connect to the Site via a service with a public friend list, like Twitter, the Publisher may check to see if any people you follow on Twitter are also Site members. If the Publisher finds a match, the Publisher will replicate your Twitter relationship with those members, setting them to be fans, followers, or friends on the Publisher Site.  
• For example, if you connect via a service that has a private contact list (like Google and Yahoo!), the Publisher checks for people in your contacts who are Site members and suggest that you become a fan of these users.   
• When users share content with their friends, the Publisher may use friend lists from third-party services to create a list of contacts to whom you may choose to send the email message.  
• For example, the Publisher may use friend lists from a third-party service to create a list of contacts to whom you may choose to send an invitation to view an interactive slideshow.  
• When you are connected via a third-party service, the Publisher may access certain account information, such as your profile picture, what stories are popular in your network, and what your friends are saying about certain articles or blog posts, in order to enhance and personalize your experience on the Site.

In addition, if you connect to a Facebook account, your experience on the Site may be personalized. For example, you may automatically see what stories are popular in your network, and what your friends are saying about particular stories. Please note that you may disconnect third party accounts at any time.   
Please remember that the Publisher does not control the privacy practices of these third-party services. The Publisher encourages you to read the privacy policies of all third-party service providers. You can deactivate your account at any time by visiting the preferences page for your profile. When you deactivate your account, your user profile will be disabled, but your public comments will remain on the site. The Site has no responsibility to take down, remove, or edit any of your public activities or any submissions that are a result of your public activities. If you opt out of these technologies, you will continue to see advertising displayed on the Site, but the advertising may not be targeted to your interests. Please remember that the Publisher does not have access to, or control over, advertisers' or service providers' cookies, and the information practices of third parties are not covered by this privacy policy. 

#### Use of Aggregate Data

The Publisher may collect and use certain non-personal information (e.g., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service provider) to optimise its goods and services (which may include the display of personalised content and advertising) including the Publisher’s Web pages for your computer.  
The Publisher may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve its goods and services including its Web sites and make them more responsive to the needs of its customers. This statistical compilation and analysis of information may also be used by the Publisher or provided to others as a summary report for marketing, advertising or research purposes.

#### Security

The Publisher strives to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable information of its customers. The Publisher uses a variety of physical and electronic security measures including restricting physical access to its offices and firewalls and secure databases to keep personal information secure from misuse, loss or unauthorized use or disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. The Publisher limits access to contact information about you to employees or service providers who the Publisher believes reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. The Publisher also has adopted commercially reasonable technical, physical, and administrative procedures to help protect information about you from loss, misuse, and alteration. Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The Publisher wants you to feel confident using the Site, but the Publisher cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to the Publisher. 

#### Access to Personal Information

You have a right to access most personal information the Publisher holds about you and if the Publisher denies access in some circumstances, the Publisher will tell you why. To request access, please contact the Publisher’s privacy officer as set out at the end of this document.

#### Public Information

Any information posted on bulletin boards and/or communicated in chat areas becomes public information. While the Publisher strives to protect and respect your privacy, the Publisher cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in a chat room or bulletin board.

#### Cookies

Cookies are data that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. They allow the Publisher to track usage patterns and to compile data that can help the Publisher improve its content and target advertising. If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature. But you should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide you with features such as merchandise transactions or registered services.

#### Online Links to Third Party and Co-Branded Sites

The Publisher may establish relationships with business partners that allow visitors to the Publisher’s Internet sites to link directly to sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites may be "co-branded" with the Publisher’s logo - however, these sites may not be operated or maintained by or on behalf of the Publisher. These sites may collect personal information from you that may be shared with the Publisher. This Privacy Statement will apply to any personal information the Publisher obtains in this manner. The Publisher is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to the Publisher’s sites. These links are meant for the user's convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by the Publisher of the content, policies or practices of those third party sites. Once you have left the Publisher’s site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site.

#### What else you should know about privacy on the Internet

Remember to close your browser when you have finished your user session. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. You as an individual are responsible for the security of and access to your own computer. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the Internet. The Publisher does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If the Publisher learns that it has collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, the Publisher will delete that information from its database as quickly as possible. If you believe that the Publisher may have collected information from a child under 13, please contact the Publisher at privacy@publishingservicesinternational.im .

#### Changes to the privacy policy
