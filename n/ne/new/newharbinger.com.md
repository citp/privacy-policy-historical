Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you provide to or through our Website or email will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the internet. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.

We retain records to the extent required by applicable law and for only the time period required by applicable law.
