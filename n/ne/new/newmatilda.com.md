# Privacy Policy - New Matilda

**Privacy – Commercial**

At Large Media Pty Ltd (trading as New Matilda) is dedicated to keeping your details private. Any information, we collect in relation to you, is kept strictly secured.

We do not pass on/sell/swap any of your personal details with anyone. We use this information to identify your orders and provide you with our email; that's all. At Large Media Pty Ltd uses cookies to allow you to login to your account, maintain a shopping cart and to purchase items in your shopping cart. Cookies sent to your computer from At Large Media Pty Ltd only last while you’re browsing our website.

We do not store persistent cookies on your computer. Whenever you use our website, or any other website, the computer on which the web pages are stored (the Web server) needs to know the network address of your computer so that it can send the requested web pages to your internet browser.

The unique network address of your computer is called its "IP address", and is sent automatically each time you access any internet site. From a computer's IP address, it is possible to determine the general geographic location of that computer, but otherwise it is anonymous. We do not keep a record of the IP addresses from which users access our site except where you have specifically provided us with information about yourself, in which case we also record your IP address for security purposes.

An example of this would be when proceeding to a checkout to finalise an order you may wish to make. After completing the form provided, your IP address will be stored along with a transaction number that allows us to track your order.
