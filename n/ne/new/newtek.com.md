# NewTek.com - Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

This privacy policy covers information collected by NewTek, including all the associated NewTek group of sites.

At NewTek, ensuring the privacy of our website visitors is an important concern. We will not collect any personal information about our online visitors unless it is submitted voluntarily, in which case we will act in a responsible manner to protect your personal information.

**Third Parties**

We are committed to keeping e-mail addresses confidential; we will not sell, rent or lease our mailing lists to third parties, and we will not provide your personal information to any third party individuals or companies, without your permission. When filling out any request form on the NewTek website, you may be added to our database for future communication, or for statistical purposes. You may be given the choice of being contacted by a NewTek representative -defined as an internal NewTek salesperson and/or an authorized NewTek reseller or distributor. If you specify that you do not wish to be contacted, your preference will be noted in our database and your contact data will not be used, except for statistical purposes.

**Server Logs & IP Addresses **

NewTek does keep track of server logs in order to perform internal statistical analyses. These logs do not contain personal information, such as name or e-mail address. The logs are used to analyze what areas of our website are most popular, in an effort to better serve our website visitors.

**Cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your browser, which may then be saved on your PC. Some of our Web pages use cookies in order to understand what areas of our website are of interest to you, in an effort to better serve you when you return to our website. If you do not want your browser to accept cookies, you can set it to decline them. You must enable cookies when purchasing product, or accessing our software download areas. NewTek does not use cookies to track your activities for advertising purposes. NewTek does not sell advertising to third parties using pop-up advertising.

**Product Registration**

Information submitted via our product registration forms is maintained in our registration database, and is used for statistical analysis and internal operations, as well as to update our subscriber lists. When registering your product, only the information that appears with an asterisk is required from you. By providing your e-mail address, you are acknowledging that we may send you periodic product announcements, and other information related to NewTek. You may contact us at 1-800-843-8934 to remove your e-mail information from our database.

**Information Requests**

NewTek uses the Web to better educate customers about our products. For this reason, we have forms on our site that can be used to request specific information. If you request information, you will receive it in the manner described on the form (postal mail, e-mail, telephone contact, etc.). We will use the information you provide, to contact you in the method you prefer, and only use it for that purpose. By providing your e-mail address to us, you are acknowledging that we may send you periodic product announcements, and other information related to NewTek.

**Event Registration**

When you register for an event, your contact information may be added to our database for future communication, or for statistical purposes.

**Product Purchases**

Information is collected at the time of a sale in order to complete the sale, and deliver the products. Customer lists are not sold or distributed to third parties. Credit card transactions are processed by Authorize.net and virtualCART. A professional payment authorization service was chosen for added security and reliability. Both of these companies utilize secure server technology. Only the purchase price and the credit card information given by the customer is supplied to Authorize.net and virtualCART. Information collected during transactions is maintained in their databases for accounting and billing purposes. Information from these transactions is not released to third parties. NewTek does not maintain a copy of the credit card information on its servers. Purchases from vendors linked from the NewTek site (i.e., Amazon, DeskTop Video, etc.), are subject to that site's privacy policy.

**Mailing Lists**

NewTek maintains subscription mailing lists. These lists are "opt-in" lists. This means that you must subscribe to these lists using your preferred e-mail account, and you must confirm your subscription, via return e-mail. Users are never subscribed to these mailing lists based on requesting information, making a purchase, or forgetting to uncheck a box during ordering. Every e-mail sent out using our mailing list, clearly identifies NewTek as the sender of the mail, and explains how to unsubscribe from the list at the bottom of the e-mail. You will use the same preferred e-mail address that you initially entered to "opt-in."

**Discussion Forums**

By joining our Discussion Forums, you agree to receive infrequent e-mail announcements, regarding special offers from NewTek.

In an effort to better serve our user forum visitors, our forums use cookies to store your preferences in your browser for a period of one year, should you choose to customize the bulletin board to reflect your preferences, by clicking on "preferences" in the user forums.

Please note that all information you may post on the user forums is considered public information, and is subject to all the terms and conditions outlined in the NewTek user forums statement. Information stored in the Forums databases is not used for unsolicited e-mail.
