<p>The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical   address or email address. </p>






<h4>2. Information Collection and Use</h4>

<p>The server on which the Web Site is located collects and saves only the   default information customarily logged by web server software. Such information  may include the date and time of your visit, the originating IP address, and the   pages and images requested. </p>

<p>When we require personally identifying information, we will inform you about   the types of information we collect and how we use it. We hope this will help   you make an informed decision about sharing your personal information with us. </p>
