For example, once you have completed the registration process, a cookie will be used to remember your registration preferences. See the Digital Advertising & Analytics section [insert link to this section] of this Privacy Policy to learn more about the use of this information and the choices available to you.

Newsmax uses service providers to provide email and direct mail services to Newsmax.

Newsmax may share information with a sponsor or other third party that is interested in providing you with products and services (“Third-Party Providers”). You may instruct us at any time not to share your Personal Data with such Third-Party Providers by contacting us in the manner provided under “Your Choices Regarding Personal Data Collection and Use.”

Newsmax reserves the right to transfer the information it collects to successors to the relevant portion of any of Newsmax’s businesses or to independent contractors it engages to assist with or perform on Newsmax’s behalf any of the foregoing activities. Also, if Newsmax’s assets are subject to a claim in bankruptcy, Personal Data and Monitoring Data may be an asset subject to the claims of a trustee in bankruptcy and may be available to Newsmax’s creditors. In addition, Newsmax reserves the right to use Personal Data to contact you regarding your account status and changes to this Privacy Policy or any other policies, agreements or transactions relevant to your use of the Newsmax Offerings.

**Activity of Our Business**

Newsmax may use the Personal Data you share with us to provide you with the information or product(s) you signed up for or purchased. No Personal Data will be given to any third-party platform for advertising or marketing purposes. Contact information for texting groups will not be shared to third parties.

We may use third-party service providers, such as ad networks, to perform certain advertising activities on our behalf, such as retargeting, but we will not provide them with your Personal Data. Newsmax advertising does not use segments designed to target children under sixteen (16) years of age to serve or optimize advertisements. Newsmax does not use automatic decision-making. We may engage in profiling for targeted marketing purposes.

**Digital Advertising and Analytics**

We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) who serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites and mobile apps. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your visits to the Site, other sites or apps, and elsewhere over time, including that data across associated devices. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.

Newsmax adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles and to the European Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) Principles in the European Union (“EU”) in connection with this interest-based advertising activity. U.S. individuals may visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices> while EU individuals can visit [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising by companies participating in these consumer choice tools. You may also use tools provided by mobile operating system providers, such as limit ad tracking, to opt-out of interest-based advertising on your mobile device to opt-out of interest-based advertising on your mobile device. Your choices will apply to this browser or mobile device. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser or mobile device, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.

We may also work with third parties that collect data about your use of the Sites and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes. Newsmax uses Google Analytics and other third-party services to improve the performance of the Site and for analytics and marketing purposes.

We will process and store your information only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of the storage, or as permitted by law.
