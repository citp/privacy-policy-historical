# Neoseeker Privacy Policy

|  |  |  |  **Neoseeker Privacy Policy**

Neoseeker and its Operators, Neo Era Media, Inc. understand and respect the need for the privacy of its users. To keep you informed of our privacy policies, we have provided this document disclosing Neo Era Media's intent, purpose and use of possibly private information, and detailing the methods of gathering of such information. 

Neoseeker works with a third party (Rydium) that serves ads to the site. To find out more about how [**Rydium**](http://www.rydiumnetwork.com/about.html) manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on our site please follow this link to go to **Rydium's Privacy Policy** section of our privacy page. 

Visitors to Neoseeker are not subject to involuntary information disclosure of any nature, other than those intrinsic to the operation of the site and the World Wide Web in general. Certain operations and features on Neoseeker may require the use of cookies and/or the propagation of session information. These cookies and sessions facilitate the visitor's experience at Neoseeker, but do not represent any other security or privacy concern outside of isolated, per visit session identification and/or recurring sessions for the purpose of storing and maintaining user submitted site preferences. 

Neoseeker does not collect private information from its users without their knowledge. Generally, users who come to Neoseeker are not required to disclose personal or private information. However, some special services such as forums and user content may require registration in order to allow full access to features. Further, Neoseeker encourages users to provide cursory private and/or personal information to build the community aspect of the site, and to obtain basic group demographics data for statistical analysis. Neoseeker does NOT sell, lease or rent to third parties, any private information linkable to a particular user and gathered through the registration process, without express consent from its users as indicated through information forms that users voluntarily fill out. 

From time to time, Neoseeker will offer incentives to users in the form of contests, prizes, and giveaways, and request that users fill out surveys or questionnaires to qualify for participation in these special promotions. Unless explicitly indicated, information from these surveys, and questionaires are used in group demographics studies and for better audience targetting - no direct relationship between demographic data and individual users is ever available to third parties. 

Neoseeker will take reasonable precautionary measures to protect and safeguard all information gathered from its users. Neoseeker does not, however, take any responsibility for any breach of security, accidental disclosure, theft, or tampering of its users' information. 

**Privacy for Children - As per COPA**

Although Neoseeker is generally targetted to an adult audience, we welcome the visitation and participation of young users, with their parents' consent. It is strongly recommended that users under the age of 13 refrain from disclosing any personal and/or private information either through the user registration system, or through participation in questionnaires and surveys, and instead opt to remain anonymous in their participation of site activities.

Please note that as of April 21st, 2000, the Child Online Protection Act of 1998 prohibits Neoseeker from the collection of private information from users under the age of 13 without parental consent. Users under the age of 13 must provide a signed letter from their parents to indicate that they are aware of their child's activities on Neoseeker and consent to these activities. This letter must be mailed or faxed to  Neo Era Media, Inc using the contact information below, before they can participate in activities requesting the disclosure of private information. 

Parents of our younger users may at any time, revoke their consent, and may request to review and edit the private information disclosed by sending a written request to Neo Era Media,Inc. via fax or mail. 

Though Neoseeker will take reasonable measures to ensure that users under the age of 13 do not disclose their private information without first obtaining parental consent, the site cannot guarantee the protection of young users who choose not to disclose their age and who do not follow the requirements set forth by COPA.
