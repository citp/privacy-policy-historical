To learn more about the cookies and other tracking mechanisms that we use, please see our <http://neo4j.com/privacy-policy/cookies/>.

**Disclosure**

We may provide your personal data and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you for their use solely to provide us with such assistance. For example, we may use a third party payment processor to process your payments. In connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain any personal data or any financial information such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly to our third party processors. Unless we give you the choice to opt-out and you do not exercise your opt-out right, Neo4j’s service providers do not have any right to use personal data we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us or for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. We will not disclose your sensitive or other personal data to a third party unless you have provided us with affirmative or explicit (opt in) consent. If you use our Neo4j Browser Sync service, we use Auth0 to authenticate you and any information that you save in our Neo4j Browser Sync service will be hosted by our service provider Firebase. Firebase’s use of your information is subject to Firebase’s policies at <https://www.firebase.com/terms/privacy-policy.html> .

We will also disclose your personal data (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce the Neo4j Terms of Use agreement or to protect our rights or (c) to protect the safety of users of our Site and our services. We will not sell your personal data to any company or organization, but we may transfer your personal data to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Neo4j participates or to a purchaser or acquirer of all or substantially all of Neo4j’s assets to which this Site relates.

**Links to Third Party Sites**

The Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources over which Neo4j does not have control (“External Web Sites”).  For example, our pages at Slack, Google Groups, and Stackoverflow are External Web Sites. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Neo4j of those External Web Sites. You acknowledge that Neo4j is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Neo4j is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites. Your use of External Web Sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked to External Web Sites.

**Social Plugins on Our Site**

We may use social plugins on our Site and may include icons that allow you to interact with third party social networks such as LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.  For example, you may “like” us or a book on Facebook or follow us or Tweet about us on Twitter. If you use our Neo4j Browser Sync, Neo4j Cloud and Neo4j Sandbox services, you will be required to login using your GitHub, Twitter and/or Google credentials. The third party social plugin may set a cookie when your browser creates a connection to the servers of such social networks and the plugin may transmit your data to the social networks. 

Additionally, there may be places where we offer the ability for Neo4j applications to connect with third party social networks, such as Twitter or Facebook.  We will collect certain data that the third party social networks provide to us and we will only use that data to provide the application for your use. Your use of these social plugins is subject to the privacy policies of the third party social networks.

**Retaining your personal data**

We keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the purposes for which it was collected. Where we keep your data for purposes beyond those of our contractual fulfilment, we keep the data only as long as necessary and/or mandated by law for the respective purpose.

When we decide how long we will keep your information we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, why we need it, and any relevant legal requirements.

We may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely.

**Security**

We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry practice. Such measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personal data from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Neo4j may use secure socket layer and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personal data. The security of the Neo4j Browser Sync service is provided by our cloud hosting provider, Firebase and you can read more about Firebase’s security policies at <https://www.firebase.com/terms/privacy-policy.html>.

**Your Rights Regarding Personal Data Concerning You**

You have a right to receive confirmation whether personal data concerning the person in question is being processed by us, to receive information about the processing and to access the personal data, and to obtain a copy of the personal data; object to our processing of personal data; have personal data concerning you deleted, and to have incorrect data about you corrected, and to restrict the processing of data concerning you; data portability, meaning that you in certain cases have a right to receive personal data concerning you in a commonly used format, or to have it transmitted to another personal data controller in accordance with your specification; and to not be subject to a decision based only on automatic processing.

**Notice to Users Outside of the United States of America (Transfers)**

Any information you enter on this Site may be transferred outside of the country in which you are located, to the United States of America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in other countries, such as the European Union. In particular, you are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country in certain situations. By agreeing to the terms of use and this Privacy Policy, you agree and consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in other countries, particularly the European Union, and to the processing of that information by Neo4j on servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.

Additionally, transfers of personal data from the European Union to the United States of America are made using the EU Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (Decision 2004/915/EC) in accordance with applicable law. Please contact us for more information about this, or if you want to obtain a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses used.

Due to the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, Neo4j may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Neo4j will post our updated Privacy Policy on our Site along with notice that the Privacy Policy has been changed so you are always aware of what personal data we may collect and how we may use this information. Neo4j may also send registered users of the Site e-mail notifications notifying such users of any material changes to the Privacy Policy. Neo4j encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this Site and/or continued provision of personal data to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.
