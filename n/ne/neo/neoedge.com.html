                     <b>Collection and Use of Personal Information:</b>  When we use the term "Personal Information" we mean
                        information such as your first/middle initial or name and last name, street address, town or city, state,
                        zip code, telephone number, instant-messenger nickname, blog or other personal website URL, date of birth,

                        Information also includes information about your personal preferences, use of the Service and content that
                        you have obtained via the Service, survey responses and your transactions or relationship with us.
                        <br><br>
                        NeoEdge Networks, Inc.  is the sole owner of the information collected on www.neoedge.com.   NeoEdge Networks,
                        Inc. collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site or
                        NeoEdge-powered web sites.  We collect Personal Information about you when you visit NeoEdge-powered web sites and
                        when you input information, when you register to use any services, features or functions of the Service, when you
                        participate in promotions, when you use or obtain applications and data via the Service, or in the course of any other
                        exchanges of information, transactions and activities.  If you choose to contact us as a consumer, you are required to
                        give contact information (such as name and email address).  If you contact us as an advertiser or affiliate, you are
                        required to give us this and additional information (such mailing address and, for affiliates, web site, business, and
                        account setup information).  We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have
                        expressed interest and, in the case of affiliates, to facilitate co-marketing initiatives.  We may use the information
                        we obtain from you or your usage of the Service, including Personal Information, to tailor your experience with the
                        Service, to display content we think may be of interest to you, or to let us customize what you see when you visit a
                        NeoEdge-powered site or use the Service according to your preferences.
                        <br><br>
                        We will not share personally identifiable information with 3rd parties for their promotional purposes and your
                        personally identifiable information will not be supplemented and stored alongside data from 3rd party sources.  We
                        may also maintain a database of transactions conducted on the Service and we use this information to effect such
                        transactions and in aggregate form to track the success of the Service and NeoEdge-powered sites.
                        <br><br>
                        The NeoEdge Networks Desktop Client that is part of the Service is associated with a unique identifier.  Through
                        this identifier, NeoEdge Networks collects information about Service usage, which is used to operate and improve
                        the Service and its content, to determine the content that may be transmitted to you using the Service, and for
                        other diagnostic, marketing and promotional purposes.
                        <br><br>
                        It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information and to keep
                        the Personal Information that you provide to us up to date.  <b>We cannot and will not be responsible for
                        any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information
                        or you fail to update the information you give us.</b>  To correct any inaccuracies or to update the information
                        you have provided to us, in addition to the options available to you on NeoEdge-powered sites and the Service,
                        you may contact the Privacy Policy Administrator at <a class="a02" href="mailto:privacy@neoedge.com">privacy@neoedge.com</a>.
                        <br><br>
                     <b>During Registration:</b> Should you choose to register with NeoEdge Networks, you may be required to provide
                        us with your e-mail address, as well as optionally additional Personal Information. As a registered user of
                        the NeoEdge Networks, from time to time, we may also provide you with certain options to opt-in to subscribe to
                        e-mail newsletters and other periodic information.  If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your
                        name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way
                        to unsubscribe.  You will also have the right to opt-out or change your preferences at any time or unsubscribe to
                        particular e-mail communications by responding to that e-mail and using the 'unsubscribe' or opt-out procedure
                        included in that communication.
                        <br><br>
                        If you are a registered user, you acknowledge, understand and agree that you are giving us your consent
                        to track your activities, your use of the Service, its functions and features, and agree to this Privacy
                        Statement and our software license agreement (the "<u>Agreement</u>") with you.
                        <br><br>
                     <b>Sharing of Information with Business Partners and Others:</b> If you signed up for the Service through one of
                        our business partners or entered into an agreement with a third party regarding the use of the Service, such
                        party shall have access to your Personal Information and the use of your Personal Information by that party
                        shall be subject to such third party's privacy policy.  Absent such an agreement on your part, the aggregate
                        data we collect in connection with the Service may be shared with advertisers and other business partners
                        of NeoEdge Networks and/or its affiliates, but we do not give any Personal Information to them as part of the
                        relationship except as described in this Privacy Statement.
                        <br><br>
                     <b>Use of Content:</b> Certain programs and content that you may receive via the Service may request your
                        Personal Information or provide that you enter into separate or additional agreements providing for the use
                        or collection of your Personal Information.  These arrangements are not governed by the Service and are
                        outside of the control of NeoEdge Networks.  Once you are registered with NeoEdge Networks, the Service should
                        not require you to re-enter your Personal Information.  You should therefore treat any such requests to
                        collect your Personal Information or to enter into any agreements or other terms and conditions the same way
                        that you would treat such requests that you encounter during your use of the Internet.  Content that you receive
                        via the Service may direct you to one or more locations on the Internet and those locations may in turn direct
                        you to Internet sites that are not affiliated with the Service or one of our business partners.  Accordingly,
                        you should exercise caution whenever content that you have obtained via the Service requests that you provide
                        Personal Information.  To uninstall the Service, navigate to add/remove programs on the control panel on your
                        Windows machine, choose each game or Game Player enabled with the NeoEdge service and click on remove.  If you
                        are ever in doubt as to whether Personal Information is required for your use of the Service, you should refuse to
                        provide such information and should contact our Customer Service representative at: <a class="a02" href="mailto:support@neoedge.com">support@neoedge.com</a>.
                        <br><br>
                     <b>Cookies and Similar Technology:</b> We use 'cookie' technology on our website to collect data regarding your
                        visits to that site.  We use cookies and similar tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keeping count of your return visits to our websites or our advertisers' or partners' sites; </li>
                            <li>Accumulating and reporting aggregate, statistical information in connection with the Service and our websites; </li>
                            <li>Determining which features users like best; and </li>
                            <li>Understanding and keeping track of requests for content. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Although we may track the numbers of users to inform us on how best to improve and update the Service and
                        enhance the experience for all visitors, Personal Information is not extracted in this process. We use
                        tracking information on an aggregated basis to help us operate NeoEdge Networks, enhance and improve our
                        Service, improve the look of the Service and our websites and display advertising and marketing information.
                        <br><br>
                        The Service uses a private peer to peer networking model to power some of its games. This means that the Service
                        and its components can make use of your computer's resources to service another user's or set of user's requests
                        at any point in time. The information that is shared between your computer and other computers is only related to
                        the content that is part of our Service and at no point in time is information outside of our Service accessed or
                        shared.
                        <br><br>
                        The Service and our websites may contain advertisements, references and links to other websites and
                        organizations. We may also use third parties to display or serve advertising on the Service and our
                        web-based newsletters or other communications which you may choose to receive.  Some of our business
                        partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies and web bug technologies on our site to measure advertising
                        effectiveness.  We have no access to or control over these technologies.  This privacy statement covers
                        the use of cookies by the NeoEdge service only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.  You should be
                        aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third
                        parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the
                        Internet.  The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours. Even
                        if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and
                        practices regarding your information. <b>This Privacy Statement does not cover any use of Personal Information
                        that an Advertiser or ad server may collect from you.</b> We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly
                        of them in this regard.
                        <br><br>
                     <b>Privacy of Your Postings:</b> We respect the privacy of the contents of users' e-mail and any postings on
                        our websites. However, we reserve the right to monitor, edit, and disclose your use of the Service, information
                        pertaining to any e-mail or posting or its contents to a third party if we believe such action is required by

                        <br><br>
                     <b>Disclosure to Third Parties:</b> We do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal Information to
                        unaffiliated entities or entities that are not our advertisers for promotional purposes, except in the limited circumstances
                        listed below. When we plan to disclose your Personal Information to advertisers, we ask you to opt-in to
                        do so, in which case their use of your information is subject to the advertisers' own privacy policies. The
                        Service also offers co-branded services and features, which are events and/or promotions that we put together
                        with another company ("Co-Branded Partner"). We will share your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner
                        and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded promotion, service, feature or function, means that
                        you opt-in and have given your affirmative consent to both NeoEdge Networks and our Co-Branded Partner to
                        collect and use your Personal Information. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your
                        Personal Information, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly.
                        <br><br>
                        We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of
                        administering and maintaining NeoEdge Networks services, features, functions and operations. We will
                        refer to these third parties as "<u>service providers</u>" and we use service providers to efficiently provide the
                        full range of content and the services, features and functions we bring you and we request that our service
                        providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that
                        are not associated with the NeoEdge Networks. Additionally, such service providers are not permitted to use
                        your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.
                        <br><br>
                        We will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following limited circumstances: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); </li>
                            <li>If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, our Agreement, this Privacy Statement, or any of our other terms and conditions, Rules, offerings or any other services, features or functions of the Service, or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of other users of the Service, NeoEdge Networks, its affiliates, or any of its or their service providers, suppliers, advertisers, customers, users, registered users or any other party;  </li>
                            <li>If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; or </li>
                            <li>In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or our affiliates.  </li>
                        </ul>

                        <br>
                     <b>Security &amp; Protection of Personal Information:</b> Your information is stored on our servers located in the
                        United States, Canada and elsewhere. We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, as
                        with most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or
                        private communications over an unsecured transmission.  We reserve the right to disclose your personally
                        identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights
                        and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
                        <br><br>
                        We also limit access to the Service by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper
                        handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality
                        will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our service providers follow the same policy.
                        <br><br>
                        We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including, without
                        limitation, a registered user of any services, features or functions of the Service, if we believe
                        there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access any services, features or functions
                        of the Service. If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate
                        to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not
                        to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access
                        cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.
                        <br><br>
