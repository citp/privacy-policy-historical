                     <b>Collection and Use of Personal Information:</b>  When we use the term "Personal Information" we mean 
                        information such as your first/middle initial or name and last name, street address, town or city, state, 
                        zip code, telephone number, instant-messenger nickname, blog or other personal website URL, date of birth,

                        collect Personal Information about you when you visit the Site and when you input information, when you register 
                        to use any services, features or functions on the Site, when you participate in promotions, when you use or obtain

                        activities.  If you choose to contact us as a consumer, you are required to give contact information (such as name 
                        and email address).  If you contact us as an advertiser or affiliate, you are required to give us this and additional 
                        information (such mailing address and, for affiliates, web site, business, and account setup information).  We use 
                        this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest and, in the case 
                        of affiliates, to facilitate co-marketing initiatives.  We may use the information we obtain from you or your usage 
                        of the Service, including Personal Information, to tailor your experience with the Service, to display content we 
                        think may be of interest to you, or to let us customize what you see when you visit the Site or use the Service 
                        according to your preferences.
                        <br><br>
                        We will not share personally identifiable information with 3rd parties for their promotional purposes and your 
                        personally identifiable information will not be supplemented and stored alongside data from 3rd party sources.  We 
                        may also maintain a database of transactions conducted on the Site and we use this information to effect such 
                        transactions and in aggregate form to track the success of the Site.

                        the Service and its content, to determine the content that may be transmitted to you using the Service, and for 
                        other diagnostic, marketing and promotional purposes.

                        e-mail newsletters and other periodic information.  If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your

                        to unsubscribe.  You will also have the right to opt-out or change your preferences at any time or unsubscribe to 
                        particular e-mail communications by responding to that e-mail and using the 'unsubscribe' or opt-out procedure 
                        included in that communication.  
                        <br><br>
                        If you are a registered user, you acknowledge, understand and agree that you are giving us your consent 
                        to track your activities, your use of the Service, its functions and features, and agree to this Privacy 
                        Statement and our software license agreement (the "<u>Agreement</u>") with you. 
                        <br><br>
                     <b>Sharing of Information with Business Partners and Others:</b> If you signed up for the Service through one of 
                        our business partners or entered into an agreement with a third party regarding the use of the Service, such 
                        party shall have access to your Personal Information and the use of your Personal Information by that party 
                        shall be subject to such third party's privacy policy.  Absent such an agreement on your part, the aggregate 
                        data we collect in connection with the Service may be shared with advertisers and other business partners 
                        of NeoEdge Networks and/or its affiliates, but we do not give any Personal Information to them as part of the 
                        relationship except as described in this Privacy Statement.  
                        <br><br>
                     <b>Use of Content:</b> Certain programs and content that you may receive via the Service may request your 
                        Personal Information or provide that you enter into separate or additional agreements providing for the use 
                        or collection of your Personal Information.  These arrangements are not governed by the Service and are 
                        outside of the control of NeoEdge Networks.  Once you are registered with NeoEdge Networks, the Service should 
                        not require you to re-enter your Personal Information.  You should therefore treat any such requests to 
                        collect your Personal Information or to enter into any agreements or other terms and conditions the same way 
                        that you would treat such requests that you encounter during your use of the Internet.  Content that you receive 
                        via the Service may direct you to one or more locations on the Internet and those locations may in turn direct 
                        you to Internet sites that are not affiliated with the Service or one of our business partners.  Accordingly, 
                        you should exercise caution whenever content that you have obtained via the Service requests that you provide 
                        Personal Information.  To uninstall MostFun game Player, navigate to add/remove programs on control panel on 
                        your windows machine, choose MostFun and click on remove.  If you are ever in doubt as to whether Personal 
                        Information is required for your use of 
                        the Service, you should refuse to provide such information and should contact our Customer Service representative 
                        at: <a class="a02" href="mailto:support@neoedge.com">support@neoedge.com</a>.

                        enhance the experience for all visitors, Personal Information is not extracted in this process. We use 
                        tracking information on an aggregated basis to help us operate NeoEdge Networks, enhance and improve our 
                        Service, improve the look of the Service and our websites and display advertising and marketing information.

                        The Service uses a private peer to peer networking model. This means that the Service and its components

                        our websites. However, we reserve the right to monitor, edit, and disclose your use of the Service, information 
                        pertaining to any e-mail or posting or its contents to a third party if we believe such action is required by

                     <b>Disclosure to Third Parties:</b> We do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal Information to 
                        unaffiliated entities or entities that are not our advertisers for promotional purposes, except in the limited circumstances 
                        listed below. When we plan to disclose your Personal Information to advertisers, we ask you to opt-in to 
                        do so, in which case their use of your information is subject to the advertisers' own privacy policies. The 
                        Service also offers co-branded services and features, which are events and/or promotions that we put together 
                        with another company ("Co-Branded Partner"). We will share your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner 
                        and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded promotion, service, feature or function, means that 
                        you opt-in and have given your affirmative consent to both NeoEdge Networks and our Co-Branded Partner to 
                        collect and use your Personal Information. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your 
                        Personal Information, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly. 
                        <br><br>
                        We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of 
                        administering and maintaining NeoEdge Networks services, features, functions and operations. We will 
                        refer to these third parties as "<u>service providers</u>" and we use service providers to efficiently provide the 
                        full range of content and the services, features and functions we bring you and we request that our service 
                        providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that 
                        are not associated with the NeoEdge Networks. Additionally, such service providers are not permitted to use 
                        your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes. 
                        <br><br>
                        We will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following limited circumstances: <br>

                            <li>When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); </li>
                            <li>If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, our Agreement, this Privacy Statement, or any of our other terms and conditions, Rules, offerings or any other services, features or functions of the Service, or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of other users of the Service, NeoEdge Networks, its affiliates, or any of its or their service providers, suppliers, advertisers, customers, users, registered users or any other party;  </li>
                            <li>If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; or </li>
                            <li>In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or our affiliates.  </li>                            
                        </ul>

                     <b>Security &amp; Protection of Personal Information:</b> Your information is stored on our servers located in the 
                        United States, Canada and elsewhere. We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, as 
                        with most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or 
                        private communications over an unsecured transmission.  We reserve the right to disclose your personally 
                        identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights 
                        and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. 
                        <br><br>
                        We also limit access to the Service by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper 
                        handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality 
                        will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our service providers follow the same policy. 
                        <br><br>
                        We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including, without 
                        limitation, a registered user of any services, features or functions of the Service, if we believe 
                        there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access any services, features or functions 
                        of the Service. If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate 
                        to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not 
                        to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access 
                        cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.
