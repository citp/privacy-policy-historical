# Privacy Policy - Neowin

## Privacy Policy

  1. #### Visitor Notice

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (Personal Information) or allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you are asked to register before participating on the message boards, entering a contest, or ordering e-mail newsletters. We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes:

    * To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.
    * To help you quickly find services or information on neowin.net.
    * To help us create content most relevant to you.
    * To alert you to special offers, updated information and other new services from neowin.net.
  2. #### Visitor Consent

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of the features on neowin.net, but you will not be able to access areas that require registration. neowin.net may offer newsletters, which are sent only to opt-in lists. They also include a very easy and simple way to be removed once you have joined.

  3. #### Security

neowin.net strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

  4. #### Distribution of personal information

neowin.net does not distribute personal information to any third parties. Should this change, neowin.net will not distribute any information without your prior express consent. Please be aware that it may be possible, depending on your use of various features on neowin.net, that some of your personal information is available on publically accessible web page(s). One example would be using the neowin.net forums. Consent to expose some of your personal information in these cases is implied by the use of these features.

  5. #### Hosted Sites

neowin.net gives children between the ages of 13 and 18 the ability to publicly post or distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent. Please take proper measures if you do not wish your child to have access to public forums and message boards. As always, exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in a public forum. In order to comply with the COPPA ruling, if you are younger than 13 years of age, you are forbidden from becoming a member of Neowin.net or posting information on Neowin.net message boards without direct parental consent.
