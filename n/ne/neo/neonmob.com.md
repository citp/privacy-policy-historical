_Last Updated: February 24, 2016_

NeonMob, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeonMob” or “we” or “us” or “our”) respects your right to privacy and shares your concern about the security of any information you may submit to NeonMob. This NeonMob's Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by NeonMob when you visit NeonMob’s websites (collectively, the “Site”), use any of NeonMob’s mobile applications (the “Mobile Apps”), or use any of NeonMob’s other services (together with the Site, and the Mobile Apps, the "Services”). Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered on our Services, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information.

INTERNATIONAL USERS

NEONMOB PRIMARILY STORES DATA ABOUT YOU, INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION, ON SERVERS LOCATED AND OPERATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. THEREFORE, IF YOU RESIDE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO YOU, NEONMOB MAY SEND AND STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (ALSO COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS PERSONAL DATA) OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU RESIDE OR ARE LOCATED, TO THE UNITED STATES. THEREFORE, NEONMOB’S COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO THE UNITED STATES’ LAWS RELATED TO PRIVACY AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA AND INFORMATION.  THESE LAWS, INCLUDING WHAT IS DETERMINED TO BE “PERSONAL DATA AND/OR INFORMATION,” ARE DIFFERENT AND MAY BE LESS PROTECTIVE THAN THOSE APPLICABLE TO YOU IN YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE. BY ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, AGREE AND CONSENT TO (1) THE TRANSFER TO AND PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ON SERVERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU RESIDE, (2) NEONMOB’S COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES THAT MAY BE DIFFERENT AND MAY BE LESS PROTECTIVE THAN THOSE IN YOUR COUNTRY AND (3) THAT YOU ARE TAKING A RISK BY USING THE SITE AND SERVICES.

###  **1.** **What information about me does NeonMob collect?**

**Personal Information.** NeonMob collects personal information only if you voluntarily choose to share such information with NeonMob. You may browse the Site and Mobile Apps without disclosing any personal information. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Services, we may require that you furnish personal information. When you set up an account, sign up for newsletters or participate in surveys, NeonMob may collect personal information such as your name and email address. If you place an order on the Site or a Mobile App, NeonMob may request and collect personal information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, and credit card information. You also may choose to send NeonMob personally identifying information in an e- mail message containing information or inquiries about NeonMob's Services. There are several other opportunities for you to share personal information about yourself with NeonMob on the Services. This may include information about you such as your interests, your name, and your mailing address and e-mail address. Submission of this information is strictly voluntary. 

**Anonymous or Aggregated Data.** NeonMob collects and stores certain data about the use of NeonMob's Services on an aggregate and/or anonymous basis. NeonMob does not link this information to anything personally identifiable to you. NeonMob only uses this information for system administration and to help NeonMob develop ideas about how it might improve and optimize its Services.

**Cookies and Other Technologies.** Like many websites and mobile applications, we may use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use cookies for two purposes. First, we may utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site or Mobile Apps. Second, we may utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site or Mobile Apps, to better understand how you interact with the Site and Mobile Apps and to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site and Mobile Apps. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site, Mobile Apps and Services and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or all functionalities of the Services. We and our service providers may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means in connection with Site pages and the Mobile Apps and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, track the actions of users and e-mail recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate statistics about Site and Mobile Apps usage and response rates. We may also engage one or more third party service providers to serve online advertisements on our behalf. They may use a “pixel tag” to collect anonymous information about your visits to this Site and to other websites, and they may use that information to target advertisements for goods and services. This information is collected anonymously, in a manner that does not personally identify you.

**IP Address.** When you visit and interact with the Site and Mobile Apps, NeonMob and/or third parties with whom NeonMob has contracted to provide services to NeonMob may collect IP Addresses. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.

###  **2.** **How does NeonMob use information about me?**

We typically ask you for certain personal information when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. We will use your email address to contact winners.
