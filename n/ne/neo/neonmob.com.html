            <em>Last Updated: August 13, 2012</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            NeonMob, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NeonMob" or "we" or "us" or "our") respects your right to privacy and shares your concern about the security of any
            information you may submit to NeonMob. This NeonMob's Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal
            information that may be collected by NeonMob when you visit NeonMob's websites (collectively, the "Site") or use any of NeonMob's other services (together
            with the Site, the "Services"). Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of
            information is gathered on our Services, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your
            personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1. </strong>
            <strong>What information about me does NeonMob collect?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Personal Information.</strong>
            NeonMob collects personal information only if you voluntarily choose to share such information with NeonMob. You may browse the Site without disclosing any
            personal information. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Services, we may require that you
            furnish personal information. When you set up an account, sign up for newsletters or participate in surveys, NeonMob may collect personal information such
            as your name and email address. If you place an order on the Site, NeonMob may request and collect personal information such as your name, e-mail address,
            mailing address, telephone number, and credit card information. You also may choose to send NeonMob personally identifying information in an e-mail message
            containing information or inquiries about NeonMob's Services. There are several other opportunities for you to share personal information about yourself
            with NeonMob on the Services. This may include information about you such as your interests, your name, and your mailing address and e-mail address.
            Submission of this information is strictly voluntary.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Anonymous or Aggregated Data.</strong>
            NeonMob collects and stores certain data about the use of NeonMob's Services on an aggregate and/or anonymous basis. NeonMob does not link this information
            to anything personally identifiable to you. NeonMob only uses this information for system administration and to help NeonMob develop ideas about how it
            might improve and optimize its Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cookies and Other Technologies.</strong>
            Like many websites, we may use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for
            record-keeping purposes. We may use cookies for two purposes. First, we may utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to
            the Site. Second, we may utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to
            monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when
            you log off from the Site and Services and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You
            can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If
            you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or all functionalities of the Services. We and our service providers may also
            use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means in connection with Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things,
            track the actions of Site users and e-mail recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage
            and response rates. We may also engage one or more third party service providers to serve online advertisements on our behalf. They may use a "pixel tag"
            to collect anonymous information about your visits to this Site and to other websites, and they may use that information to target advertisements for goods
            and services. This information is collected anonymously, in a manner that does not personally identify you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>IP Address.</strong>
            When you visit and interact with the Site, NeonMob and/or third parties with whom NeonMob has contracted to provide services to NeonMob may collect IP
            Addresses. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service
            Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your
            visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. </strong>
            <strong>How does NeonMob use information about me? </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fulfillment of Requests.</strong>
            NeonMob may use personal information about you to fulfill requests made by you such as to respond to your email inquiry, fill your order or add you to our
            mailing list.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Purchases.</strong>
            When you make a purchase through the Site, we may collect your credit card number or other payment account number, billing address and other information
            related to such purchase from you, and may use such information in order to fulfill your purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Administrative or Transactional Communications.</strong>
            From time to time, we may use personal information about you to send to you important information regarding the Services, changes to our terms, conditions,
            and policies and/or other administrative or transactional information. Because this information may be important to your use of the Services, you may not
            opt-out of receiving such communications.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Other Communications;</strong>
            If you choose to share any personal information with NeonMob, NeonMob may store it and use it for marketing purposes, including e-mailing you with special
            promotions and other programs of interest. NeonMob may also use this information to contact you for matters relating to your use of the Services. If the
            information is sent as part of a Services evaluation, NeonMob may also use the information to contact you about your comments.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Testimonials.</strong>
            As you are informed prior to submitting testimonials or stories to us through the Services, we may make such information public or use such information in
            our promotional materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>E-mails to Friends.</strong>
            We may provide functionality to permit you to send messages regarding Services-related content to a friend through the Site. If you wish to use this
            feature, you may be required to provide us with, and we may use, your friend's e-mail address so that we can facilitate your sending of such message to
            your friend. Please make sure that you have the right to submit your friend's email to us. We will not use your friend's information other than to
            facilitate your sending of this one time message
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Promotions.</strong>
            We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, the "Promotions") through the Services. We typically ask you for certain
            personal information when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. We will use your email address to contact winners. You should carefully review the
            rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Services, as they may contain additional important information about our use of
            personal information about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of the Promotion rules concerning the treatment of personal information about
            you conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms and conditions of the Promotion rules shall control.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Internal Business Purposes.</strong>
            We may also use personal information about you for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, order fulfillment, workflow planning and
            other similar purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Compliance with Applicable Law.</strong>
            We may need to collect and retain personal information about you in order to comply with applicable laws and to respond to requests from public
            authorities, including public authorities outside your country of residence.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3. </strong>
            <strong>To whom does NeonMob disclose information about me?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            NeonMob does not share, rent or sell your information to another company in ways other than disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Third Party Agents and Service Providers.</strong>
            We work with third party agents and service providers who may provide services including but not limited to data analysis, payment processing, order
            fulfillment and other services of an administrative nature. We may share personal information about you with third parties for the purpose of enabling
            these third parties to provide these types of services (for example, if you choose to make a purchase through the Site, we may share personal information
            with our third party service providers to fulfill your purchase, including, without limitation, to process your credit card or payment account number or to
            ship products to you). NeonMob requires that its agents and service providers that have access to such personal information properly safeguard that
            personal information and use it only for the purpose that it was collected and not for their own promotional marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>E-mails to Friends.</strong>
            Please note that any personal information you provide in connection with sending messages regarding Services-related content to a friend through the Site,

            We may share the personal information you provide in connection with Promotions with third party sponsors of such Promotions (irrespective of whether such
            Promotions are hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of
            each Promotion in which you participate through the Services, as they may contain additional important information about a sponsor's or other third party's
            use of personal information about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of personal information about you

          </li>
          <li>
            if it is necessary in NeonMob's opinion to do so to protect the rights, privacy, property, or safety of NeonMob or its employees, NeonMob
            affiliates, the users of its Services, or the public;

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>4. </strong>
            <strong>What does NeonMob do to protect the data transmitted through the Services?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will take the appropriate legal, organizational, and technical measures to protect personal information to protect personal information, including
            sensitive information such as credit card information, from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However,
            regardless of the effectiveness of our security measures, no security system is impenetrable. We ask that you do your part by, at a minimum, keeping any
            computer passwords you use to access the Internet strictly confidential. If at any time you believe that your interaction with the Services is no longer
            secure, please let us know as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>5. </strong>
            <strong>How can I remove or transport my data?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can remove any information you provide via the Services at anytime by logging in to your account. When you request that we delete your NeonMob account,
            your data will be permanently expunged from our primary production servers and further access to your account will not be possible. However, portions of
            your data, consisting of aggregate data derived from your account information, may remain on our production servers indefinitely. Your data may also remain
            on a backup server or media. NeonMob may keep these backups to ensure our continued ability to provide the Services to you in the event of malfunction or
            damage to our primary production servers. We also reserve the right to use any non-personally identifiable data derived from or incorporating your personal
            information.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6. </strong>
            <strong>What about linked sites and third-party software and applications?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For your convenience, NeonMob may include links to or allow its Services to connect to third party sites, products and services (the "Third Party

            Party Services have their own policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices. Please consult each applicable third party's policies and
            practice. NeonMob is not responsible for the policies or practices of such third parties. The information practices of those Third Party Services are not
            covered by this Privacy Policy. These Third Party Services may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to download and use Third Party Services for use in connection with NeonMob Services, you should read carefully the terms of use for such

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>7. </strong>
            <strong>Does NeonMob offer opt-outs relating to marketing?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If and when you create a NeonMob account you may be presented with the opportunity to receive (opt-in) marketing-related emails from NeonMob and from our
            select third party partners. If you no longer wish to receive the marketing-related emails you've requested from us, you may opt out of receiving these
            emails by following the unsubscribe instructions within each email communication or by logging into your NeonMob account and changing your email
            preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may also send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@neonmob.com">support@neonmob.com</a>. Please specify clearly which of the following choices you
            are opting out of:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please note that if you opt out as described above, we will not be able to remove personally identifiable information about you from the databases of third

            <strong>What is NeonMob's policy regarding children's use of NeonMob's services?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            While NeonMob encourages everyone to visit its Site and learn about the company and its technology and applications, NeonMob has no desire to collect
            information from those under the age of 13. Any instance of personal information about a child under the age of 13 being collected would be purely
            accidental and unintentional. If a minor would like to submit information to NeonMob, NeonMob asks that the child's parent submit the information on his or
            her behalf. NeonMob strongly encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet and to take appropriate steps to ensure a
            positive and safe experience.

            The United States Federal Trade Commission has a web page <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/index.html">http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/index.html</a> devoted
            to providing you with information about protecting your privacy online. NeonMob encourages you to familiarize yourself with the concepts discussed on this
            page.

        </p>
        <p>
            We will retain personal information about you for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention
            period is required by law and/or regulations. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information we process is reliable for its intended
            use, accurate, and complete as necessary to carry out the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

            privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the "Last
