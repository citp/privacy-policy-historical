# Privacy Policy for NeoSpire Managed Hosting

## NeoSpire Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which NeoSpire Corporation ("NeoSpire") collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from customers in connection with NeoSpire managed hosting services and other internet services. NeoSpire is committed to safeguarding the information its customers entrust to it in compliance with Safe Harbor provisions. NeoSpire reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy and other policies prospectively at any time, subject to applicable laws and regulations, by posting notice of such changes on its web sites.

NeoSpire may collect personally identifiable information from customers in a variety of ways, including online and offline subscription and order forms, paper or telephone submissions and other instances where customers are invited to volunteer such information. Additionally, contact information may be collected during any correspondence relating to customer support, as well as in connection with products and services offered on NeoSpire sites. NeoSpire may collect such information as contact name, business name and type, address, phone number, email address, billing information including credit card number and expiration date as well as other information. We will only use your name, address, billing information/credit card information to process your order. The addresses are used for customer support, required notifications, product and policy updates and marketing releases. Under no circumstances will we use this information for anything else not described in this Privacy Policy. All users may at any time opt-out of our marketing by clicking the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of all marketing and membership notices.

Whenever customers apply for our services or sign up for any other product or service through NeoSpire, they may be required to submit financial information such as a credit card number and billing address before we will process the application. NeoSpire will not sell, share or rent any financial information collected except as disclosed in this policy or as necessary to fulfill orders.

NeoSpire uses your unique network address to help diagnose potential problems with your server and to administer our website.

NeoSpire makes diligent efforts to maintain accurate information on our customers. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, NeoSpire has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.

NeoSpire has put stringent security procedures in place to protect information collected about our customers. We constantly monitor our systems, which are protected using industry-standard security measures. Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") connections are used to communicate to our system to protect Customer financial information as well as encrypting vital information that customers input through NeoSpire's websites. However, NeoSpire cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on or transmitted from our systems will be completely secure.

Customers may access all personal identifiable information that we collect and maintain by contacting their account manager or customer support 24/7. They can correct factual errors in personally identifiable information by sending us a request to our support department, support@neospire.net. To protect Customer privacy and security, NeoSpire reserves the right to take reasonable steps to verify Customer identity prior to granting access or processing changes or corrections.

NeoSpire may contact customers regarding products and services offered by NeoSpire and its trusted affiliates, business partners and independent contractors. We may also use information collected through our Web site for research regarding the effectiveness of the website and related marketing, advertising and sales efforts. Information will only be made publicly available where mandated by governing agencies or as disclosed in the terms and conditions of our agreements with customers.

Electronic communications may be sent by NeoSpire using customers' personal contact information to inform them of new products, important industry news or about general services and upgrades provided by NeoSpire. If customers do not wish to receive these industry notices, they can contact their account manager. However, in order to fulfill our service obligations, NeoSpire will continue to send emails regarding Customers' account administration or service interruptions for system maintenance.

Information collected from customers may be disclosed to independent contractors and business partners who have agreed to hold this information in confidence, not use it for any purpose except to carry out the service they are providing for NeoSpire, and honor our privacy and security policies in the way this information is handled. NeoSpire may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from customers to actual or prospective investors and partners. Should a sale of NeoSpire's business ever occur, collected Customer information may be transferred along with the sale but the information will be treated in the same manner as this privacy policy.

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

Account and other personal information may be released when we are required to do so by law, court order, law enforcement authority or regulatory agency.

We strongly recommend that Customers review the privacy statement and policies of any online service prior to submitting personal information. NeoSpire has no control over and is not responsible for the gathering practices of other websites, including those to which we may link and those which may link to us.

By choosing to visit and interact with NeoSpire, Customers agree that their visit and any dispute regarding the protection of their privacy during such visit is subject to this Privacy Statement including, but not limited to, the provisions regarding limitations on damages and the application of the law of the state of Texas. Please note that if customers enter into other contractual agreements with NeoSpire, privacy terms and conditions of such other agreements may supplement or supersede this policy. Questions and concerns about privacy at NeoSpire should be directed to legal@neospire.com.

Regardless of later updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, we will never use the information you submit under our current Privacy Policy in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use.

Should questions concerning this Privacy Policy arise, please send an email to legal@neospire.com. Please specify "Privacy Policy" in the subject line of the e-mail.
