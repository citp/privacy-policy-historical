_What Members Can Do to Help_

Northeast Credit Union is committed to protecting the privacy of its members and customers. You can help by following these simple guidelines:

  * Protect your account numbers, card numbers, PINs (personal identification numbers) and passwords. Never keep your PIN with your ATM card, check or credit card which can provide free access to your accounts if your card is lost or stolen.

Northeast Credit Union Email Security Information**

Northeast Credit Union (NECU) will periodically send emails promoting our products and services or those of our affiliates, to members for whom we have recorded email addresses. All members who receive the marketing emails will have the opportunity to opt out of this service at any time by simply clicking the unsubscribe button, entering your email address on the [_email opt-out page_](http://email.necu.org/o/?co=0786D6C8267C51C6&cid=38762D7FF7A274E108450758E412F251103E8F7CE1A6CF25), emailing Member Services at memberservices@necu.org, or calling us at 1.888.436.1847.  


As a trusted neighbor NECU will never ask you for personal account information via email. In addition, our latest technology allows you to identify authentic NECU emails upon receipt. NECU email’s that come from “Northeast Credit Union” marketing@email.necu.org.  View an example of what an email from NECU would look like in the address field, below:

A **unique identification code (UID)** appears near the top right of every email sent to you from NECU’s address. The last 4 digits of your primary membership number assigned by Northeast Credit Union will be used. It will appear as “ **Ending in 1234** ”. This unique identifier will be exclusive for email’s sent to you from NECU marketing. Below is an example of what it will look like: 

NECU members will always be able to confirm any emails authenticity by calling our member service center at 1.888.436.1847. Our member service representatives will be able to verify the email when you provide them with your email address and the unique identification code. In the event your unique identity number does not match our records, the email(s) are likely to be a phishing scam and will be reported. 

_  
Exceptions_

Our Member Service staff members can reply to you or send you emails which are routed through a different server. These generally are responses directly to member inquiries and never contain personal banking information. These emails do not contain the UID. These emails will be from _memberservices@necu.org.    _In addition, when using CyberTel by initially signing up or changing your password, an auto reply email will be sent to you from _memberservices@necu.org_. This is an automated email and also does not contain the UID.   


_  
Additional Information_

We utilize third-party vendors to send some emails to member regarding products, services or information they may need. These vendors are utilized for estatements, alerts, online surveys, events, web polls, and referrals. Emails sent via our third-party vendors are identified as follows:

  * “Northeast Credit Union” _eStatements@mailhost.docuhost-net.com_
  * “Generations Gold” _info@gengold.net  _



Northeast Credit Union may also solicit feedback on how we can better serve our members. To do this we may use forms on our website that might be managed by a third-party vendor. These forms are secured and encrypted when sent to our vendors. Our member service representatives then login to their secure servers and retrieve the information.

**NOTE:** To make sure you receive our important emails, please make sure you've given the above mentioned addresses permission in your email clients such as Outlook, Hotmail, Yahoo, G-Mail, MSN, and NetZero. Sometimes certain keywords are picked up by filtering software and legitimate emails are sent to your spam folder. By allowing our subdomains to come through, you'll be sure to receive NECU messages.
