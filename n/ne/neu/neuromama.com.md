## Privacy Policy

There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Neuromama.com Account, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we're using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. 

Our Privacy Policy explains: 

  * What information we collect and why we collect it.
  * How we use that information.
  * The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.



We've tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you're not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Neuromama.com so whether you are new to Neuromama.com or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions contact us. 

Information we collect   
We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you'll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online. 

We collect information in two ways:  
Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Neuromama.com Account. When you do, we'll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number etc.. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Neuromama.com Profile, which may include your name and photo.

Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes: 

Device information  
We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Neuromama.com may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Neuromama.com Account. 

Log information  
When you use our services or view content provided by Neuromama.com, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may include: details of how you used our service, such as your search queries. telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls. 

Internet protocol address  
device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL. cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Neuromama.com Account. 

Location information  
When you use a location-enabled Neuromama.com service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. 

Unique application numbers  
Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Neuromama.com when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. 

Local storage  
We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. 

Cookies and anonymous identifiers  
We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Neuromama.com service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Neuromama.com features that may appear on other sites. 

How we use information we collect   
We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Neuromama.com and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads. 

We may use the name you provide for your Neuromama.com Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Neuromama.com Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Neuromama.com Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Neuromama.com Profile information, such as your name and photo. 

When you contact Neuromama.com, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements. 

We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we'll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health. 

We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Neuromama.com services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent. 

We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.
