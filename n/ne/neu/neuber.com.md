# Statement of Privacy

> **We respect your privacy! Ever since our website www.neuber.com came on line in 1997, we have been taking the utmost care with your data and treating it with the highest standards of confidentiality. This begins with keeping data to a minimum or not gathering it at all. Thus we do not use any behavior tracking or sharing tools, and we avoid using cookies wherever possible. Your IP addresses are either anonymized or blocked within the CDN. This keeps our websites thin and fast. Whenever Analytics, Adwords, Adsense, Custom Search Engine or the like come into play, we always use settings with the highest degree of data-protection friendliness—meaning no remarketing, no profiling, no interest- or behavior-based advertising, no cross device tracking, no user id, only anonymous transmission of IP, minimal caching, and so on. This is our way of ensuring that even third parties can obtain only minimal information about your surfing behavior, or none at all. Even when buying our software, you can remain anonymous and you do not have to provide a complete address. All this is intended to safeguard your personal data.**
> 
> Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.

> The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.

>   * to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
>   * to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
>   * to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
> 

> 
> In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.
> 
> **Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.**
