The following policy will help you to understand how we will treat your personal information. As we continue to improve our site and as we take advantage of developments in technology, this policy may change from time to time so please check this policy on an ongoing basis for revisions and updates.

**Information Collection and Use**

Once you have submitted this information and chosen a valid password, you will be able to take full advantage of everything Neucopia has to offer. You may also be asked for personal information when you report a problem with our site, or services; or, if you otherwise contact Neucopia. Neucopia also collects information using cookies, which are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. This information allows us to automatically link our customers to their personalized accounts. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Please check your browser’s guidelines should you wish to prevent cookies. Neucopia is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.

Neucopia may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Neucopia’s rights or property, other Neucopia users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Neucopia will comply with the requests of all recognized legal entities to aid in the stopping of spam, distribution of illicit sexual content to minors, or any other illegal activity brought to our attention through such channels.
