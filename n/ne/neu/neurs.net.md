#### I. Acceptance of Terms

This Privacy Policy describes NEURS's policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. NEURS (hereinafter referred to as "we", "us", "our" or "NEURS") receives your information through our various web sites, SMS, APIs, services and third-parties (hereinafter referred to as the "Services"). When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by NEURS in the United States or any other country where NEURS operates. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the NEURS Terms of Service. Each time you use the Services, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by the Terms of Service. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the Services and terminate your membership. 

  


#### II. Information Collection and Use

Visitors of the website may view various web pages without providing any personal information. If you desire to have the NEURS provide services or goods to you or an organization of which you have representative capacity, NEURS may ask you to provide certain information about yourself or your organization by filling out and submitting one or more forms. Providing personal information is optional, but NEURS reserves the right to refuse service to you if you are unable or unwilling to provide certain requested personal information as determined by NEURS.The personal information that you provide in connection with the use of the website or the products and/or services provided by NEURS is protected in numerous ways. Access to your personal information collected during the purchasing of a product or service is available through a password and unique user ID. The password is encrypted. NEURS recommends that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your personal information resides on secure servers that only selected personnel and contractors have access to via password. NEURS encrypts your personal information as it is transferred to the Company and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information. NEURS collects your information in order to record, support and facilitate your use of the website and to prevent fraud and unlawful use. If you purchase or register for products and/or services, the personal information may be used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to users. Your personal information may also be used to track your preferences in order to provide an experience customized to your tastes, or to contact you in regards to changes to the site that may affect your account or to update you as to new or updated features. NEURS does not share personal information it receives from residents of California or from residents of any other place with such other organizations for marketing purposes unless we have received an opt-in from you. 

  


#### III. Information Collected Upon Registration

When you create or reconfigure a NEURS account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username may be listed publicly on our Services.

#### IV. Additional Information

You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, or a picture.
