# Privacy policy | Neuros Technology

**What types of information do Neuros's web sites collect, and how are the sites collecting it?**

The majority of information and services provided on our web sites are offered without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can surf Neuros's web sites anonymously.

**Information You Provide**

There are a few activities on our web sites where the collection of personally identifiable information is necessary. Those activities include things like downloading software, making a purchase, entering a contest or sweepstakes, participating in our forums or contacting us. When personally identifiable information is collected, you will know because you will have to fill out a form. For most activities, we collect only your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, and zip code. When you make a purchase, we also collect your street and billing addresses, your phone number, and credit card information, if applicable. Personal information, including questions about your music interests, may also be collected for use by Neuros to improve the content of our web site, to customize the content and/or layout of our web site, to notify consumers about updates to our web site and/or to contact consumers for marketing purposes.

**Information Collected from You with Technology**

Neuros web sites may also collect additional information about you, in order to learn more about our customers. We may collect your IP address, browser type, language, and date and time of visit. As well, we may use cookies to provide you a more personalized experience. None of this information is personally identifiable, so your browsing is safe with us.

**How does Neuros use the personally identifiable information that has been collected?**

Neuros uses personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions, notify you if you've won a game or contest, and send you email updates and newsletters if you have chosen to subscribe to our services.

**Does Neuros share information with third party companies or other organizations?**

We aren't in the business of selling information about our visitors. Your personal information is safe with us.

**Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services**

On occasion, we may offer promotions -- like sweepstakes -- in conjunction with a sponsor. We may share your information with those sponsors so that they can send you other special promotions they offer, but only if you give us your permission to do so, and we will share it only with that specific sponsor. 

**Content Partners**

On some of our sites, we may provide content that is created by a third-party partner web site. In some instances the third-party sites will collect information in order to facilitate the transaction or to make the use of their content more productive and efficient. In these circumstances the information collected is shared between Neuros and our third-party sponsors.

**What type of security does Neuros provide?**

Neuros takes technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect all visitors' information. When you provide credit card information, we use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to protect it.

**Whom do I contact with questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy?**
