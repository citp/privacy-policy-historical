    <p>The mission of NEN 360 is to connect hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs to enable them to be more successful and productive. We work to fulfill this mission by helping you, your connections, and others meet, exchange ideas, collaborate, find opportunities, and recruit talent in a network of trusted relationships and groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being part of NEN 360 means sharing information about yourself with other individuals, communicating with them, as well as working privately on your own. By default, your account is set up to share the information that we have found the vast majority of our members are interested in sharing. But the amount and type of information you share is up to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the three main types of Information on NEN 360:</p>
<p><strong>Information about yourself that you share:</strong> This is the information that your connections and others on NEN 360 see about you. This includes your profile and contributions to discussions on groups and blogs on NEN 360. You have control over how much you share from your profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Communication:</strong> NEN 360 helps you communicate with your connections and other professionals. Some of this is one-to-one, some of it is in group and some of it is public discussion. You decide how much you wish to communicate to individuals or groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Private activity:</strong> We also provide tools that you can use privately on NEN 360. (For example: Searching) These actions and information are private and we don’t distribute or share them with others on the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintaining your trust is our top concern, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * We do not rent, sell or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * We do not share any information you have not chosen to display on your NEN 360 profile to other parties, unless compelled by law, or as necessary to enforce our Terms of Services or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of NEN 360, its members and the public.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * All information that you provide will be protected with industry-standard protocols and technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by e-mail or by means of a prominent notice on our website. By continuing to use the NEN 360 service after notice of changes has been sent to you or published on the NEN 360 website, you are consenting to the changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aggregate Data Collected:</p>
<p>We collect your information in the following ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Registration</strong></p>
<p>In order to become a Registered Online Member, you must provide us the following information to create an account: name, e-mail address, country, and password. Like other passwords, you should choose one that is known only by you. You acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and by creating an account on NEN 360, you allows others, including NEN 360, to identify you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Profile Information</strong></p>
<p>Once you become a Registered Online Member, you may provide additional information in the Profile section, describing your skills, professional experiences, educational background, group memberships and more. Providing additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required is entirely up to you, but providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from NEN 360 and your professional network and facilitating your search for professional resources, information and new opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Contacts Information</strong></p>
<p>In order to connect with others on NEN 360, you may use the services to send invitations either to their NEN 360 profiles or e-mail address if they are not users. The names and e-mail addresses of people whom you invite will be used to send your invitations and reminders as well as to allow NEN 360 to help expand your network. Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another member, that member will have access to your e-mail address because it is displayed in the invitation. Your connections will also have access to your e-mail address. You may not invite anyone you do not know and trust to connect with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Like most websites, we use cookies and web log files to track site usage and trends to improve the quality of our service to customize your experience on NEN 360, as well as to deliver third-party advertising to members both on and off the NEN 360 site. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone or other device, and allows us to recognize you as a member when you return to the NEN 360 website, using the same computer and the web browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use NEN 360.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing the services to our members, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through cookies will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment information (e.g., your industry or geography, career field, information about your professional or educational background) for greater customization of your experience. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. NEN 360 does not store unencrypted personally identifiable information in the cookies.</p>
