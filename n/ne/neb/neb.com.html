	<h2>New England Biolabs, Inc. Privacy Policy</h2>
Welcome to neb.com. <br>
<br>
At New England Biolabs, Inc. (“NEB”), we take your privacy seriously. We provide this Privacy Policy to make you aware of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. Your use of this site is subject to the NEB Terms of Use, the NEB Terms and Conditions of Sale, and this Privacy Policy. <br>
<br>
<h2>What We Collect</h2>
<p>In general, the types of personal information we collect include your full name, contact details and billing information (including shipping addresses and any end-user information for the products purchased), transaction, and credit card information. Additionally, in order to tailor our communications to you and to continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your scientific areas of interest, experience with our products, contact preferences, and other information that helps us serve you.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>How We Collect It</h2>
<p>You provide us your personal information when you (a) register on our website or with our Customer Service team; (b) place orders with us online, via phone, fax, or other electronic methods; (c) participate in trade shows; (d) interact with our sales and marketing teams; or (e) otherwise provide us with or make available your personal information through other registration and data capturing processes, including other public sources of such data. </p>
<p>In general, when you visit NEB at neb.com or when you interact with us in other ways, you can choose how much information you share. You can refuse to supply personal information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
By giving us your personal information, you agree that we may collect and use such personal information in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Additionally, third parties, or affiliates owned by NEB, may provide information to us about you, and if and to the extent they do, we will treat such combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. <br>
<br>
<h2>How We Use It</h2>
<p>NEB uses your information to better understand your needs and to provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate with you (when you have not expressed an interest otherwise), to update you on services and benefits, to improve website navigation, to personalize features and other services for you, to conduct market and research analysis, and for other purposes identified to you. </p>
<h2>With Whom We Share Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>In general, we provide access to your personal information only to affiliates, agents, vendors or service providers, who help us to provide products or services to you, or otherwise perform functions on our behalf. We will not sell or otherwise transfer your data to a third party for monetary consideration.</p>
We reserve the right to disclose personal information to non-affiliated third parties in limited circumstances, where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under law, to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, or to protect the safety, rights, or property of our customers, the public, or NEB.<br>
<p>If we sell or transfer a business unit (such as a subsidiary or division) or an asset (such as a product line) to another company, we may share your personal information with such company under those circumstances. </p>
In addition, we may disclose information about you to a non-affiliated third party at your request or if you consent in writing to the disclosure.<br>
<br>
<h2>Cookies and Other Tools</h2>
<p>Like many websites, NEB uses cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other technologies (collectively, “Tools”) to improve your neb.com experience. A cookie is a file containing text that is placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. With cookies in place, our system will recognize you whenever you use your web browser (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox) to connect to our page. This enables us to present you with custom web pages and otherwise improve your user experience.</p>
Disabling cookies may prevent you from using certain features of the site such as registering or placing orders. If you choose not to take advantage of these interactive features, you can set up your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie has been sent. The “Help” section of your browser will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage or delete them, visit <a data-ga-label="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" data-ga-action="https://authoring.neb.com/?sc_itemid={CB9C76D1-AB49-4BFD-837B-7DB52F0390C3}&amp;sc_mode=edit&amp;sc_lang=en&amp;sc_debug=0&amp;sc_trace=0&amp;sc_prof=0&amp;sc_ri=0&amp;sc_rb=0" data-ga-category="External Link" class="ga-event" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. <br>
<br>
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on DNT, the browser sends a message to websites requesting that they don’t track the user. Standard DNT technology is not yet finalized, and not all browsers support DNT, so neb.com information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that it provides to consumers, may continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a DNT signal is received. For more information about DNT see <a href="http://donottrack.us/" target="_blank">http://donottrack.us/</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Transfer of Data to Other Countries</h2>
<p>Any information you provide to NEB may be stored and processed, transferred between and accessed from the United States and other countries, which may not guarantee the same level of protection of personal information as the one in which you reside. However, NEB will handle your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, regardless of where your personal information is stored.</p>
<h2>Other web sites</h2>
<p>Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We use administrative, physical and technical measures to safeguard your personal information and help protect it from unauthorized access. All of our website communications are HTTPS based, and provide end to end encryption for any data flowing between NEB and the browser.&nbsp; We also use both passwords and usernames to authenticate users (i.e. to verify the identity of each registered user). Users are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their own passwords.</p>
However, no security can be 100% effective, so we cannot guarantee the security of your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us by contacting us at the email address listed below.<br>
<br>
<h2>Opting Out</h2>
<p>If you do not wish to receive certain communications from us, you may opt out by: (1) declining the service offered when registering or at other information gathering points on our website, or (2) informing us that you no longer wish to receive such communications by emailing us at:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:NEBUnsubscribe@neb.com">NEBUnsubscribe@neb.com</a>. We will comply with such requests unless such communications from us are required by law or contract or do not require your consent under applicable laws. If you opt out of certain communications, you may not be able to access certain of our products or services. If you would like to opt-out of receiving communications from affiliates or other third parties with whom we shared data in accordance with this policy, please contact such third parties directly. </p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Data Integrity</h2>
<p>We will use personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by you. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
</p>
<h2>Access and Correction of Information</h2>
<p>You may at any times request access to a summary of your personal information held by us, and request corrections or updates to that information. We will make reasonable efforts to respond promptly to such requests for information in accordance with local laws. Our response to such requests will be limited to information under our direct control.&nbsp; </p>
If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible at the below address. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect.<br>
<br>
<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>From time to time, we may update and timely post revisions to this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy. If the Privacy Policy changes in a way that materially affects how we handle personal information, we will not use the personal information we previously gathered in the manner described in the new policy without providing notice and/or obtaining your consent, as appropriate. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about his policy, please contact NEB via email at <a href="mailto:info@neb.com">info@neb.com</a>.</p>
