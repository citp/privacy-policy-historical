	Privacy Policy

			<div class="inner">
	<p>Effective as of 3/6/2017.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide information about how
New England Biolabs, Inc. (“NEB”) collects, uses, and transfers personal
information when you visit our website, <a href="https://www.neb.com">www.neb.com</a>,
our mobile applications, and other websites that we control that
include a direct link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the
“Sites”). Carefully review this document, as your use of the Sites is
subject to this Privacy Policy. <br>
<br>
</p><h2>Scope</h2>
This Privacy Policy covers only information collected through the Sites.
It does not cover any other data collection or processing, including,
without limitation, collection conducted offline, through other products
or services that do not display a direct link to this Privacy Policy,
or by other companies at third party sites that do not display a direct
link to this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<h2>Information Collected</h2>
In general, the types of personal information we collect include your
contact information (such as name, company name, address, phone number
and email address), and where relevant to fulfill a transaction or
request, additional information such as billing or payment information,
shipping addresses, end-user information, and credit card information.
Additionally, in order to tailor our communications to you, we may ask
you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your scientific
areas of interest, experience with our products, contact preferences,
and other information. You provide us your personal information when you
register on or submit information via the Sites, or otherwise provide
us with or make available your personal information through other
registration and data capturing processes, including other public
sources of such data. In general, when you visit the Sites or interact
with us in other ways you can refuse to supply personal information,
with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain
website-related activities. By providing your personal information, you
agree that we may collect, use, share and/or transfer that information
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
We also collect information during your use and navigation of the Sites,
such as the URL of the site you came from, the browser software you
use, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, IP ports, date/time of access,
data transferred, pages visited, amount of time you spend on the Sites,
information about transactions conducted on the Sites, and other
“clickstream” data. If you use our mobile app or access the Sites from a
mobile device, then we also collect your device information (such as
device OS version and device hardware), unique device identifiers
(including device IP address), and geolocation data. This data is
generated and collected automatically, as part of the standard operation
of the Sites.<br>
<br>
We use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other technologies
(collectively, “Tools”) to collect information during your use and
navigation of the Sites. A cookie is a text file that may be stored on
your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. With cookies
in place, our system will recognize you whenever you use your web
browser to connect to our page. Disabling cookies may prevent you from
using certain features of the site. If you choose not to take advantage
of these interactive features, you can set your browser to reject
cookies or to alert you when a cookie has been sent. <br>
<br>
<h2>Use of Information</h2>
NEB uses your information to better understand your needs, fulfill
orders, complete transactions, provide requested services and
information, and update you on products, services and benefits, which
may include marketing materials. If you order products through our
Sites, we may contact you by email to provide information about your
order (e.g., order confirmations, shipment notifications). If you have
an account with the Sites, we may also send you email regarding your
account status or changes to relevant agreements or policies.<br>
<br>
We use information passively submitted by you to personalize features
and your experience of the Sites, and otherwise to generally improve the
content, design, and navigation of the Sites. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, we may combine the various types of data we collect.
We may conduct marketing analysis and similar research to assist us in
making business decisions. Such analysis and research activities may be
conducted through third party services, using anonymous data and
aggregate statistics generated by our information collection.<br>
<br>
In compliance with applicable law, we may use contact information that
you have provided to send you information regarding products and
services, as well as other information that we think may be useful to
you. If you do not wish to receive marketing information from us, you
may opt out (see “<a href="http://authoring.neb.com/sitecore/shell/Controls/Rich%20Text%20Editor/EditorPage.aspx?da=core&amp;id=%7b50F1DB87-81C0-49CC-A00C-1578927D9638%7d&amp;ed=FIELD4460281970&amp;vs&amp;la=en&amp;fld=%7bF882B32F-D62C-4EF3-94F6-A0FD134FD247%7d&amp;so=%2fsitecore%2fsystem%2fSettings%2fHtml+Editor+Profiles%2fMultiline+Rich+Text+No+Notes+and+Refs&amp;di=0&amp;hdl=H4460282319&amp;us=sitecore%5clewandowski&amp;mo&amp;pe=0#optout">Opting Out</a>” below).<br>
<br>
<h2>Sharing/Transferring Personal Information</h2>
In general, we share and/or transfer your personal information to
affiliates, agents, vendors or service providers who assist us in the
process of providing products or services to you, or otherwise perform
functions on our behalf. We will not rent, sell or otherwise transfer
your data to a third party for monetary consideration. We reserve the
right to disclose personal information to third parties where we believe
in good faith that disclosure is required by law, to cooperate with
regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a judicial
proceeding or legal process, or to protect the safety, rights, or
property of our customers, the public, or NEB. If we sell or transfer a
business unit or asset to another company, we may share or transfer your
personal information pursuant to the terms of the transaction. In
addition, we may disclose information about you to a third party at your
request, or if you consent to the disclosure.<br>
<br>
<h2>International Data Transfer </h2>
Any personal information you provide to NEB, its affiliates, agents,
vendors and service providers may be stored and processed, transferred
between and accessed from the United States and other countries, which
may not guarantee the same level of protection of personal information
as the country in which you reside. However, NEB will handle personal
information collected through a Site in accordance with the Site’s
linked Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<h2>Other Web Sites</h2>
Our Sites may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once
you have used these links to leave our Sites, you should note that we
do not have any control over other websites. Therefore, we cannot be
responsible for the protection of any information provided while
visiting such sites, and such sites are not governed by this Privacy
Policy. You should exercise caution and carefully review the privacy
statement applicable to the website in question.<br>
<br>
<h2>Security</h2>
We use commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical
measures intended to safeguard your personal information and help
protect it from unauthorized access or loss. Users are responsible for
maintaining the confidentiality of their own passwords to access the
Sites. However, no security can be 100% effective, and you should not
expect that your information will remain private under all
circumstances. If you have reason to believe that the security of your
personal information has been compromised, please immediately notify us
by contacting us at <a href="mailto:ITinfo@neb.com">ITinfo@neb.com</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="optout"></a>Opting Out</h2>
If you do not wish to receive marketing information from us, you may opt
out by: (1) declining marketing information when registering or at
other information gathering points on the Sites, or (2) informing us
that you no longer wish to receive marketing communications by emailing
us at <a href="http://authoring.neb.com/sitecore/shell/Controls/Rich%20Text%20Editor/NEBUnsubscribe@neb.com">NEBUnsubscribe@neb.com</a>.
We will comply with these requests unless such communications are
required by law or contract or do not require your consent under
applicable laws. If you would like to opt-out of receiving
communications from affiliates or other third parties with whom we
shared data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, please contact such
third parties directly.<br>
<br>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18. <br>
<br>
<h2>Data Retention and Access</h2>
We retain data for at least as long as required by applicable law. You
may access, correct, and/or update your information by accessing your
accounts or profiles, where relevant, on the Sites. You may request a
summary of information we hold about you, as well as corrections,
updates or deletion of your information, by contacting us at <a href="http://authoring.neb.com/sitecore/shell/Controls/Rich%20Text%20Editor/NEBUnsubscribe@neb.com">ITinfo@neb.com</a>.
Our response to such requests will be limited to information under our
direct control. We will make reasonable efforts to respond promptly to
such requests in accordance with applicable laws.<br>
<br>
<h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time and
in our sole discretion. Changes will be effective upon the date the
revised Privacy Policy is posted on the <a href="https://www.neb.com">neb.com</a>
website, with the effective date noted in the Policy header at the top
of this page. When you visit the Sites, you accept the version of this
Privacy Policy in effect at that time. We recommend that you
periodically revisit and review this page to obtain the latest
information on our privacy practices.<br>
<br>
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact NEB via email at <a href="mailto:ITinfo@neb.com">ITinfo@neb.com</a>.<p></p>
