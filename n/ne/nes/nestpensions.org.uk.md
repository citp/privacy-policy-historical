# Privacy policy

National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) Corporation ('we' or 'us') takes your privacy seriously. Please read this Privacy policy, our privacy information notices below, help areas (when interacting with our website) and our [Cookies policy](https://web.archive.org/schemeweb/nest/nestcorporation/cookies-policy.html). Together they explain our data protection policy and describe how we’ll use any personal data we collect from you or that is provided to us.

In May 2018 the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 and the Data Protection Act 2018 (jointly referred to as ‘Data Protection legislation’) came into force. In most instances, NEST Corporation is the controller for the processing of personal information we hold about you. More information on this can be found in the relevant individual privacy information notice below.

NEST Corporation is registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office (Registration number: Z2343426).

Our Data Protection Officer is our Chief Risk Officer, whose office can be contacted at [dpo@nestcorporation.org.uk](mailto:dpo@nestcorporation.org.uk).

## Change to Data protection law

Legislation governing the use of your personal information has changed. In May 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation came into force and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 was passed.  You can read about the changes on the ICO’s [website](https://ico.org.uk/).

In line with the above changes, NEST has updated this policy and has prepared privacy information notices (see links provided below) so that you can find out how we use your personal information. 

In addition, NEST has prepared this [frequently asked questions document](https://web.archive.org/schemeweb/dam/nestlibrary/NEST-scheme-data-protection-FAQs-1218.pdf) for anyone seeking additional information on data protection legislation not contained in the relevant privacy notices below.

Our privacy information notices are listed below under titles which relate specifically to who the information applies to.
