## 4\. Why Nestlé collects personal data and how it uses it

Nestlé collects and uses personal data only as necessary for the purposes for which it was obtained. Nestlé may use your personal data for some or all of the following purposes:

  * **Orders** \- to process and ship your orders and to inform you about the status of your orders. Please note that there are many e-commerce websites that sell Nestlé products but that are not controlled or operated by Nestlé. We recommend that you read their policies, including on privacy, before making any purchases on those websites.
  * **Account maintenance** \- to create and maintain your accounts with us, including administering any consumer loyalty or rewards programs that are associated with your account.
  * **Consumer service** \- to provide you with consumer service, including responses to your inquiries, complaints and general feedback about our products. Consumer service may be provided through various forms of communication, including via email, letter, telephone and online chat features.
  * **Consumer engagement** \- to get you more actively engaged with our products and services. This may involve the use or publication of consumer-generated content.
  * **Personalisation** \- Nestlé may combine personal data about you collected from one source (e.g. a website) with data collected from another source (e.g. an offline event). This provides Nestlé with a more complete view of you as a consumer, which, in turn, allows Nestlé to serve you better and with greater personalisation, including in respect of the following:
    * _Websites_ \- to improve and personalise your experience on websites, using data such as account login information, technical computer information, and/or previous website usage information;
    * _Products_ \- to improve Nestlé’s products, tailor them to your needs and come up with new product ideas. This includes the use of demographic information, consumer profiling information and consumer feedback; and
    * _Interest-based advertising_ \- to serve you advertisements tailored to your interests. One way Nestlé does this is to match activities or information collected on Nestlé Sites with data collected about you on third party sites (i.e. data-matching). This type of advertising is also known as “online behavioural advertising” or “targeted advertising”. Such personalisation is typically performed via cookies or similar technologies.
  * **Marketing communications** \- to provide you with marketing communications where you have opted-in to receiving such communications (including information about Nestlé, its products and services, competitions and promotions). These can be shared via electronic means (e.g. SMS, emails and online advertising) and via post.

If you opt-in to receiving SMS, your mobile service provider’s policy for receiving SMS will apply, which may be at a fee.

  * **Social features** – to offer you a number of social features, including the following:
    * _Website community features on a Nestlé Site -_ When you visit a Nestlé Site with a community feature and upload or share recipes, pictures, videos, artwork or other content, Nestlé may use and display the personal data that you share on such sites. 
    * _Website viral features_ \- Nestlé may use your personal data to offer you website viral features, such as a tell-a-friend program, where you can share certain news, product information, promotions or other content with family and friends. This typically requires the collection and use of personal contact information (e.g. names and emails) so that the selected one-time message/content can be delivered to their recipients. 
    * _Third party social networking_ \- Nestlé may use your personal data from when you interact with third party social networking features such as “Facebook Connect” or “Facebook Like”. These features may be integrated on Nestlé Sites including for purposes such as running contests and allowing you to share content with friends. If you use these features, Nestlé may have the ability to obtain certain personal data about you from your social networking information. You can learn more about how these features work, and the profile data Nestlé may obtain about you, by visiting the website of the relevant third party social network. 
    * _Other specific purposes -_ We may use your personal data for other specific business purposes, including to maintain the day-to-day operation and security of Nestlé Sites, to conduct demographic studies or audits, and to contact you for consumer research.
  * **Media relations** \- When you submit a media enquiry, the personal details that you provide, and the subject matter of your query, will be collected and stored by Nestlé Corporate Communications in its database, which is accessible worldwide by Nestlé’s Corporate Communication teams.

Your personal details may be used to send you news and information about Nestlé and invitations to events relevant to your interests and will be retained and kept secure by Nestlé as set out in this privacy notice. If you do not agree, please let us know by sending an email to [mediarelations@nestle.com](mailto:mediarelations@nestle.com). If you consent, you may revoke it at any time by sending an email to [mediarelations@nestle.com](mailto:mediarelations@nestle.com).

## 5\. Sharing of personal data by Nestlé

Nestlé does not share your personal data with any third party that intends to use it for direct marketing purposes, unless you have provided specific consent in relation to this. 

Nestlé may share your personal data with third parties for other purposes, but only in the following circumstances:

  


### 5.1 Affiliates

Nestlé may provide your personal data to its affiliates or related companies for legitimate business purposes.

  


### 5.2 Service providers 

Nestlé may engage service providers, agents or contractors to provide services on its behalf, including to administer Nestlé Sites and services available to you. These third parties may come to access or otherwise process your personal data in the course of providing these services.

Nestlé requires such third parties, who may be based outside the country from which you have accessed the Nestlé Site or service, to comply with all relevant data protection laws and security requirements in relation to your personal data, usually by way of a written agreement. 

  


### 5.3 Partners and joint promotions

Nestlé may run a joint or co-sponsored program or promotion with another company and, as part of your involvement in the activity, collect and use your personal data. 

Your personal data will only be shared with another company if you have opted in to receive information directly from that company. Nestlé encourages you to read the privacy notice of any such company before sharing personal data. If you do not want your personal data to be collected by or shared with a company other than Nestlé, you can always choose not to participate in such activity. If you do opt-in to communications from such a company, remember that you always have the right to opt-out and you would need to contact that company directly to do so.

  


### 5.4 Legal requirements and business transfer

Nestlé may disclose your personal data if it is required to do so by law or if, in Nestlé’s good faith judgment, such legal disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes or respond to any claims.

In the event of a full or partial merger with, or acquisition of all or part of Nestlé by another company, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by that Nestlé business, which could include personal data.

## 7\. Data security and retention

### 7.1 Data security

In order to keep your personal data secure, Nestlé has implemented a number of security measures, including: 

  * **Secure operating environments** \- Nestlé stores your data in secure operating environments and only accessible to Nestlé employees, agents and contractors on a need-to-know basis. Nestlé also follows generally accepted industry standards in this respect.
  * **Encryption for payment information** \- Nestlé uses industry-standard encryption to provide protection for sensitive financial information, such as credit card information sent over the Internet (e.g. when you make payments through Nestlé’s online stores).
  * **Prior authentication for account access** \- Nestlé requires its registered consumers to verify their identity (e.g. login ID and password) before they can access or make changes to their account. This is aimed to prevent unauthorized accesses. 



Please note that these protections do not apply to personal data you choose to share in public areas such as on community websites. 

  


### 7.2 Retention

Nestlé will only retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the stated purpose, taking into account also our need to answer queries or resolve problems, provide improved and new services, and comply with legal requirements under applicable laws.

This means that we may retain your personal data for a reasonable period after your last interaction with us. When the personal data that we collect is no longer required in this way, we destroy or delete it in a secure manner.
