# NEA - Privacy Statement

### I. Introduction

The National Education Association ("NEA") values the trust and privacy of its members and other supporters. This Privacy Policy sets forth NEA's practices regarding: (1) what personal information we collect about you — both online via the NEA website and NEA Intranet and offline via traditional, hard copy forms; (2) how we use that information; (3) under what circumstances we disclose it; (4) what choices are available to you regarding such information collection; and, (5) what security we use to protect such information. This Privacy Policy also provides some additional information for users of the NEA website and NEA Intranet.

  2. The term "personal information" means any piece of information that on its own can specifically identify a current or former NEA member or other person who has provided personal information to us in connection with obtaining an NEA product or service.

### IX. Additional Information for Users of the NEA Web Site or NEA Intranet

  1. Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information  
If you use the NEA website or the NEA Intranet, you provide us with certain non-personal information in addition to any personal information that you may voluntarily provide. For example, if you browse the NEA website or NEA Intranet or download information, our operating system automatically records the following non-personal information:
    1. The Internet domain for your Internet service (such as "xcompany.com" or "xcompany.net" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourcollege.edu" if you connect from a college or university domain);  

    2. The type of browser that you use (such as "America Online version 7" or "Microsoft Internet Explorer 5");  

    3. The type of operating system that you use (such as Windows or Macintosh);  

    4. The date and time that you visit the NEA website or NEA Intranet and the webpages that you view;  

    5. The address of the previous website that you visited if you linked to us from another website; and  

    6. The address of the next website that you visit if you link to it from the NEA website or NEA Intranet.  

We use the above non-personal information to diagnose technical problems and track user interests so that we can provide content that interests you.

We gather this non-personal information in the aggregate and we share it in the same manner that we share personal information, as described in Section V above.

  2. Cookies  
We use cookies to track what you are viewing when you visit the NEA website and NEA Intranet, and to enhance your user experience. In order to provide you with customized content and an enhanced user experience, certain cookies used by NEA identify you as an individual. If you are concerned about NEA's use of cookies, check your Internet browser. Most have a setting that will allow you to reject cookies. However, some NEA features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

Additionally, NEA allows third parties who advertise or provide content on the NEA website or NEA Intranet to use cookies. Third parties' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, and is not governed by this Privacy Policy.

  3. Discussion Forums  
If you participate in a discussion forum on the NEA website or NEA Intranet, your comments, along with any personal information that you voluntarily disclose, may be collected, used, and shared by anyone with access to that forum. We are not responsible for the personal information that you choose to submit in a discussion forum.  

  4. Children  
The NEA website and NEA Intranet are general websites, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.  

  5. External Links  
This Privacy Policy applies only to the NEA website and NEA Intranet. It does not cover any websites that are linked to or from the NEA website or NEA Intranet for which we are not responsible ("linked-sites"). These linked-sites will have their own policies and practices which may be different from ours. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the policies and practices of the linked-sites especially if you provide personal information to them.
