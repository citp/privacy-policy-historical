NEA MEMBER BENEFITS: PRIVACY STATEMENT**

This Web Site is published and maintained by NEA's Member Benefits Corporation (NEA MB), a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Education Association (NEA).

This NEA MB Privacy Statement is intended to provide NEA Members and the users of the NEA MB Web Site with our policy regarding data supplied by NEA members when using the site. 

The NEA MB web server automatically recognizes and records domain names (such as AOL.com and yahoo.com) but not individual e-mail addresses. Any statistics that are gathered while members are on our Web Site will be used to improve the content of the NEA MB Web Site and the programs offered to NEA members.

**Personal Information and How It is Used**

NEA Member Benefits values the privacy of NEA members, and we believe that the best way to serve you on the Internet is with honesty, accountability and self-regulation. We are sensitive to the issues of privacy and have structured our on-line activities to protect your privacy and let you be in control of what information you choose to disclose. We collect and keep all information you volunteer while on our site, such as the information supplied when you register, place a request, or enter a giveaway. 

When you register on our Web Site as a member of the NEA, you provide your name, address, telephone number, password, a unique login name, and your social security number. This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons: 1) future personal identification, 2) to verify membership (including family member), 3) to maintain a Members Only area on the Site, and 4) to customize the content of our Site to meet your specific needs. In addition, your E-mail address may be used to send you an E-mail message confirming your member registration and to announce future NEA MB Programs and Web Site enhancements. 

All of the www.neamb.com member data are kept secure and confidential and are well protected against unauthorized access. NEA Member Benefits does not sell, trade, rent, lease or share personal information about our members to any third party non-NEA source **(period)**. 

**Online Surveys and Contests**

NEA Member Benefits values your opinions and comments, so we periodically conduct online surveys.  Also, NEA MB may, from time to time, sponsor giveaways to give you the opportunity to win prizes. 

The surveys are entirely optional for all members. Typically, the information collected is aggregated and used to help improve NEA MB products and services and to develop appealing Web Site content and features.  Contact information is used to notify giveaway winners, and the information you provide as part of the member's registration process helps NEA MB make your online experience more convenient, personal and pleasant.
