# NearbyNow: Back to School Entry Form

## 

_Last Updated: April 10, 2006_

At NearbyNow we recognize that privacy is important. We hate spam, and detest the practice of selling personal information to third parties. But we understand that by sharing some personal information we can make our service more useful and enjoyable. This document outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use NearbyNow services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard the information you share. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing personal information with us.

**Personal information and other data we collect**

  * For most NearbyNow services, no registration is required and we do not collect personal information. However, for some services (such as a "sale alert" service), we may require collecting personal information that can identify you, such as an e-mail, cell phone number, or other contact information, as part of our registration.
  * We may combine personal information collected from you with information from other NearbyNow services or third parties to provide a better user experience, including customizing content for you. For example, if we see other users with similar interests, we might suggest content to you that you might like.
  * NearbyNow uses cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your browser) and other technologies to enhance your online experience and to learn about how you use NearbyNow services in order to improve the quality of our services. This allows you to do things like save your preferences, and make subsequent visits faster and easier.
  * NearbyNow's servers automatically record information when you visit our website or use some of our products, including the URL, IP address, browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.



**Uses**

  * We may use personal information to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized content and advertising. For example, if you would specify to receive e-mail alerts for "all sales on women.s apparel", we would send an e-mail to you to notify you of the sale, and that e-mail may include a related advertisement.
  * We hate spam, and will not send unsolicited e-mails to your account. We only send e-mails and notifications for services for which you have subscribed.
  * We do not sell personal information to third parties.
  * We may also use personal information for auditing, research and analysis to operate and improve NearbyNow technologies and services.
  * We may share aggregated non-personal information (information that is recorded about users and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user) with third parties outside of Google, such as mall operators, merchants, and other individuals. For example, we may let many parties know what the "most popular searches for today" are.
  * When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  * We may also share information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.



**Your choices**

  * We offer you choices when we ask for personal information, whenever reasonably possible.
  * You may decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your browser, although some of our features or services may not function properly as a result.
  * We make good faith efforts to provide you access to your personal information upon request and to let you correct such data if it is inaccurate and delete it, when reasonably possible.
