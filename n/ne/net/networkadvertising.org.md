Information Collection and Use

The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. The NAI will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Aggregate information about the numbers of visitors to this site and the numbers who opt out from each network advertiser will be shared with the NAI member companies. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a text file that is stored on a user's hard drive. It contains no personally identifiable information. One of the main purposes of this Web site is to enable users to opt out of the Online Preference Marketing (OPM) practices of the member companies of the NAI. To enable a user to opt out, the NAI or member company must set an "opt-out cookie" on the user's browser. At this site, the setting of that opt-out cookie occurs when the user chooses, via one of our opt-out pages, not to participate in the OPM practices of an NAI member company. The only way that an NAI member company will be able to know that a user has chosen not to participate in OPM is if the member company can read an opt-out cookie on that user's browser. For more information about how "opting out" works, please see the "Opt-Out" section of this site. 

Use of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.
