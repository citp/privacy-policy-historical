# Privacy Policy | netTALK.com, INC.

netTALK.COM, INC. ("netTALK") is committed to your privacy. We obey all laws and regulations in the United States applicable to our use and disclosure of your information. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not trade, sell, or disclose to any third party any form of PII (as defined below) without your consent and we will not disclose or make available any PII to any third parties seeking to market third party products without your consent. We have set forth this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect and use information from our customers who use services and products from netTALK ("Customers") and from visitors to our Web sites and from potential customers who have communicated, made contact, or interacted with netTALK ("Visitors"), both in connection with online and offline services and products offered by netTALK.

**Collection of Information**

netTALK shall collect personally identifiable information, including but not limited to name, physical address, email address, telephone number, credit card information, and other personal information (collectively, "PII"), from Customers when initiating service and in connection with the provision or marketing of products and services. netTALK may collect PII from Visitors in connection with any visit to our Web sites, any communication about our services and products, or other transactions or interactions with netTALK. netTALK may also collect non-personally identifiable information from Customers and Visitors regarding usage of our services or our Web site ("Non-PII"). Non-PII may include Web site pages viewed, time spent using certain services, demographic data, cookies, and other information which does not specifically identify any one individual. "Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a Web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that Web site. Many Web sites use cookies for these purposes. We may use cookies to customize your visit to our Web sites and for other purposes to make your visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance our service. In addition to our cookies, we may also use (and our third party advertisers may use) clear gifs, Web beacons, and third party cookies to improve the performance of our Web sites, provide certain features such as advertising, or to anonymously track usage of our Web sites and track the online activity of users. In addition, we may use such devices in our HTML-based emails to track the usage of such emails in much the same manner as usage of our Web sites is tracked.You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer, including third party cookies, or flush them from your browser by adjusting your Web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Web site, but it may interfere with some of its functionality.

**Anti-Spyware Policy**

netTALK believes that Spyware is a threat to consumer privacy and a consumer's experience online. Therefore, we forbid any netTALK employee, agent, partner, affiliate, or contractor from intentionally deploying or using Spyware (as defined in this policy) on behalf of netTALK. Spyware refers to any executable software application that is installed on a user's personal computer and covertly gathers and transmits PII through the user's Internet connection without the knowledge or consent of the user. Cookies and Web beacons are not considered Spyware. Spyware may gather PII, such as e-mail addresses and credit card information, and may even alter personal computer settings. Intentional use of Spyware by any netTALK employee, agent, partner, or affiliate on netTALK's behalf will not be tolerated and will be considered grounds for dismissal, contract termination, and/or loss of payment.

**Use of Information**

netTALK will use PII (1) to market products and services to Customers and Visitors that netTALK believes may be of interest to them, (2) to provide services and products requested by Customers and Visitors and (3) to enable its vendors and contractors to provide and assist netTALK in the marketing and provision of such services and products to netTALK, Customers, or Visitors. However, we will not share your credit card information with any third parties unless they are involved in processing payments for services that you have purchased from netTALK. netTALK only works with partners whom we believe maintain high standards with respect to privacy and consumer rights. netTALK may also use and disclose PII to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activities that threaten the integrity of our service or network, to investigate fraud or violations of our [_Terms of Service_](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service), as required by courts or administrative agencies or in connection with a sale, merger, or reorganization of netTALK's business. Non-PII may be shared with any number of third parties by netTALK.

We can also disclose your CPNI for legal or regulatory reasons, including in response to subpoenas and court orders. We can also use CPNI to investigate fraud and to prevent violation of our Terms of Service and unlawful use of our network, services, and other customers.

However, if at any time in the future we plan to use PII in a way that differs from this policy, we will post such changes here and provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. Your continued use following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes.
