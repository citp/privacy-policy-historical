_**Accounts and Secure Transactions**_

A portion of NETRonline allows a visitor to acquire online products or services by secure credit card transaction. When an purchase is made, NETRonline will be acquiring your name, address, email, and password. Basic order information is stored in our database: who, what, when, how much. Credit Card transactions are conducted using the authorizing service E Processing Network. NETR and the domain netronline.com possess a secure certificate from VeriSign that is used during credit card transactions.

Two types of credit card transactions will be conducted through NETRonline: 

**1) Pay as you go** :   
Each purchase is made by a separate credit card transaction. 

**2) Account** :   
One initial purchase is made by either submitting funds to NETRonline by postal mail, or by a secure online credit card transaction. A running balance will be maintained by NETRonline , from which future purchases will be deducted. Balance information on a customer's account will be securely stored in our database with the other account information. 

When a user wishes to terminate an account, all funds in that account will be returned in 7-10 business days by the method which they were submitted (either credited to the credit card or returned by postal mail). To notify NETRonline of your desire to terminate your account, you may contact NETR Account Services.
