<p class="text"><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
<br>
NetGalley LLC is committed to respecting the privacy of the individuals who use this website (the
"Website"). Accordingly, this policy (the "Policy") informs you about NetGalley LLC' practices with
regard to the collection of information about you. More specifically, this Policy describes the
kinds of information, including Personally Identifiable Information (defined below), that NetGalley
LLC may gather during your visit to the Website, why such information is gathered, how it is used,
when it might be disclosed, and what you can do if you disagree with the practices described in the
Policy.<br>
<br>
If you have questions about this Policy, or you don't see your concerns addressed here, then please
see the Questions and Changes to Your Information section at the end of the Policy.<br>
<br>
You understand and agree that by visiting the Website, you are accepting the terms of this Policy.
Please keep in mind that from time to time, NetGalley LLC may modify or amend the terms of this
Policy. Because this Policy creates a binding contract between you and NetGalley LLC, NetGalley LLC
recommends that you bookmark this page and review it regularly to ensure you are in compliance
therewith.<br>
<br>
Capitalized words used, but not defined, in this Policy, will have the meanings set forth in the
<a href="/about/terms/">Terms of Use</a>.<br>
<br>
<strong>Information Collected</strong><br>
<br>
One of the basic principles that NetGalley LLC has followed in designing this Website is that
NetGalley LLC asks for only the information it needs to provide the service(s) that you have
requested. As a result, the information that NetGalley LLC collects about you depends almost
entirely on how you choose to use the Website and NetGalley LLC' services.<br>
<br>
<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
<br>
Except as otherwise disclosed to you in this Policy, NetGalley LLC will not sell, barter, give
away, or rent information that identifies you individually ("Personally Identifiable Information")
to another entity. Under certain circumstances, NetGalley LLC may collect your Personally
Identifiable Information. For example, if you are an Authorized User who has completed a
registration form, NetGalley LLC may collect and store some or all of the following information:
your gender, name, address, company name, email address, and website address(es), if any. NetGalley
LLC uses this information to provide the services that you have requested. NetGalley LLC may use
this information to send you email about its services unless you opt out at the time of
registration or otherwise by contacting us using the information provided in the Questions and
Changes to Your Information section at the end of this Policy. Moreover, if you so choose at the
time of registration or otherwise, NetGalley LLC may use this information to allow other community
members and users to email you. If you are an Authorized User, then NetGalley LLC may share your
Personally Identifiable Information with the Client who has authorized your access to Confidential
Content in Secure Areas.<br>
<br>
<strong>Anonymous Information</strong><br>
<br>
NetGalley LLC may also gather certain information that does not identify you personally ("Anonymous
Information"). NetGalley LLC may, for example, automatically collect your IP address, browser
information, and site-domain name every time you visit this Website. NetGalley LLC may also collect
record and collect data regarding customer-traffic patterns and Website usage. NetGalley LLC uses
Anonymous Information to edit and personalize the Website and for other purposes. For example, to
make the Website more relevant to users, NetGalley LLC might show to authors certain products and
advertisements relating to them. Publishers might receive information about other advertisements
and products. Additionally, NetGalley LLC may share Anonymous Information in ways that it deems
appropriate or necessary such as sharing demographic information with advertisers or business
partners.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Cookies and Spyware</strong><br>
<br>
NetGalley LLC does not install spyware on your computer. Nor does it use spyware to retrieve
information from your computer. Like many Websites, this Website uses "cookies," which are files
that a browser stores on a computer hard drive for purposes such as notifying a Web site that a
particular user has returned. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable
them. If your browser does not accept cookies, you can still view the Website and may, as
applicable, make a purchase. For an optimal Website experience, however, NetGalley LLC recommends
that your browser be configured to accept cookies.<br>
<br>
<strong>Third Party Agents</strong><br>
<br>
NetGalley LLC occasionally employs third-party agents, affiliates, and partners who perform on its
behalf functions such as marketing, analytics, credit-card processing, shipping or stocking orders,
providing customer service, and programming this Website. These people or entities may have access
to your Personally Identifiable Information as strictly needed to perform their functions and will
be contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of such information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Emergency Situations</strong><br>
<br>
NetGalley LLC may disclose Personally Identifiable Information if required to do so by law or in
the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to applicable law or comply
with legal process served on NetGalley LLC or the Website; (b) protect and defend NetGalley LLC's
rights, property, Website, or users of the Website; (c) act under emergency circumstances to
protect the personal safety of NetGalley LLC, its affiliates, agents, business partners or users of
the Website.<br>
<br>
<strong>Children</strong><br>
<br>
This Website is not intended for children. If you are under eighteen years of age, please exit this
Website immediately.<br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong><br>
<br>
NetGalley LLC strives to ensure that the Personally Identifiable Information you share with it is
handled in a safe, secure, and responsible manner. Nevertheless, no security measures are absolute,
and there is always a possibility that a security breach could occur.<br>
<br>
<strong>Linking to Other Websites</strong><br>
<br>
This Website may contain links to other websites through advertisements or other links. The
practices described in this Policy do not apply to information gathered through such other
websites. These other websites may send their own cookies to you, collect your data, or solicit
your Personally Identifiable Information. NetGalley LLC is not responsible for the actions and
privacy policies of these other websites. Accordingly, NetGalley LLC encourages you to be aware of
when you leave this Website and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that you
visit.<br>
<br>
<strong>Contests, Sweepstakes, and Surveys</strong><br>
<br>
Any contests, surveys, sweepstakes, or similar promotional endeavors run by NetGalley LLC through
this Website will be accompanied by a set of rules specifying how the information gathered from you
will be used and disclosed, if different from that described in this Policy. Personally
Identifiable Information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to NetGalley LLC or to
its sponsors.<br>
<br>
<strong>Public Forums</strong><br>
<br>
Please remember that any information or images that you share in public areas such as message
boards, blog comments, feedback sections and the like become public. This Policy, therefore, does
not apply to them. Be careful about the information you disclose and do not post in public areas
any Personally Identifiable Information that you expect to keep private.<br>
<br>
<strong>Governing Law and Assignment</strong><br>
<br>
This Website is published in the United States and is intended for users in the United States. U.S.
law will govern in any and all disputes arising out of or relating to this Policy or use of this
Website.<br>
<br>
NetGalley LLC may change ownership or corporate organization while providing this Website and
related services. As a result, NetGalley LLC may sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise share your
information to another entity that is affiliated with NetGalley LLC, with which it has merged, or
to which NetGalley LLC, or the portion of NetGalley LLC's assets related to this Policy, are sold.
Under such circumstances, NetGalley LLC would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party
to follow the practices described in this Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.<br>
<br>
<strong>Opting Out</strong><br>
<br>
You may always opt out of receiving marketing or promotional information from NetGalley LLC as
contemplated under this policy by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@netgalley.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">info@netgalley.com</a>. You can also change or
update the information you have provided by contacting NetGalley LLC using the contact information
set forth below.<br>

NetGalley LLC to update or change the information you have provided, please contact: <a href="mailto:info@netgalley.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">info@netgalley.com</a>.</p>
