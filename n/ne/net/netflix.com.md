We use this personal information, for example, to process your registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other topics. We also use your e-mail address to send you newsletters, as well as messages about new Netflix features, Netflix special offers, promotional announcements, consumer surveys and other correspondence concerning our service.

### Security

Netflix takes information security very seriously and uses reasonable administrative, technical, physical and managerial measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access. For example, we utilize Secure Sockets Layering, an industry-standard protocol for certain of your transmissions to us, in order to encrypt the personal information that you send to us through the registration and sign up process.

Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it.

You can choose not to take advantage of this feature on your computer by unchecking the box "Remember me on this computer" when you login on the website. Netflix ready devices do not have this feature. To remove access to your Netflix account from a device, go to the "Manage Netflix ready devices and computers" link on the "Your Account" page and remove that device from your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for restricting access to your computer or device through which you access your Netflix account. If you disclose your password to anyone or share your account and/or devices with other people, you take full responsibility for their actions. Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or Netflix ready device, you should log-out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you fail to log out and deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access certain of your account information.
