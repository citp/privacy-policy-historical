At Net Lawman we are extremely concerned to protect your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all users of our site are quite rightly concerned to know that their data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not fall into the hands of a third party. Our policy is both specific and strict. It complies with UK law. If you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, **do please tell us**.

Information may be unlawfully available to hackers and snoopers. We take no responsibility for this. The risk is no different from a similar risk in a bricks and mortar establishment. Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site.

Here is a list of the information we collect, and why it is necessary to collect it: 

  1. **Basic identification and contact information** , such as your name and contact details.

This information is used:

to provide you with the services which you request  
for billing  
for answering your enquiries

for marketing our services  
to help make our web site as useful to you as possible

We expect any partner to agree to reciprocate this policy.

  5. **Your e-mail address** is recorded when you send e-mail to us, so that we can respond to you.
  6. **Disclosure to Government** and their agencies  
We are subject to the law like everyone else. We may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.
