Media Defined, Inc. recognizes that the EEA and the U.K. have established strict protections regarding the handling of Personal Data, including requirements to provide adequate protection for Personal Data transferred outside of the EEA and the U.K.. To provide adequate protection for certain Personal Data about consumers, corporate customers, clients, suppliers, business partners, job applicants, and employees received in the U.S. from the EEA and the U.K., Media Defined has elected to self-certify to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Privacy Shield”).

**Personal Data Collection and Use**

Our Website Privacy Policy describes the categories of Personal Data that we may receive in the U.S. as well as the purposes for which we use that Personal Data. Media Defined will only process Personal Data in ways that are compatible with the purpose for which Media Defined collected it, or for purposes the individual later authorizes.
