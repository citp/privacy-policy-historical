Furthermore, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is a part of, this Website's Terms of Use agreement, which also governs your use of this Website. 

#### Collection of information

A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message that helps us to verify an individual's viewing or receipt of a web page or message. Clear GIFs allow us to know whether you have viewed a web page prior to visiting our Website and may enable us to relate such information to other information, including your personal information. We use information provided from clear GIFs to allow more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing and make Media Defined better for our users. 

#### 6\. IP address and Clickstream data

Our servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when you visit us. When you request pages from our Website, our servers may log your IP address and sometimes your domain name. Our servers may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g. another website or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the website you visit after this Website; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website or a referral website; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet service provider. Personal information (including IP addresses) is not used to facilitate contact with users who have not provided their contact details to MediaDefined. Your IP address may be used to identify the clickstream that led you to our site; however, personal information is not shared with any third-party marketing companies. 

#### Rights to opt in/opt out

You have the right to "opt in" and/or "opt out" of certain of our uses of your Personal Information. For example, you may have the opportunity to choose whether you would like to receive correspondence from us and/or third-party service providers. Your Personal Information will not be shared with third-party service providers unless you give consent. You will have the opportunity to opt out of Media Defined's promotional e-mails by clicking the "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link in the e-mail you receive. You can also request this by sending an e-mail to info@mediadefined.com, specifying whether (i) you would like to opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from Media Defined in general, or just via e-mail, post and/or by phone, and/or whether (ii) you would only like to opt out of certain Media Defined's e-newsletters or correspondence. Please understand that if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us. Use, disclosure, and sharing of Personal Information 

#### 1\. Service providers

We may use third-party partners to help us operate and maintain our Website and deliver our products and services. We may also share your information with our service providers and other third parties ("Affiliated Parties") that provide products or services for or through this Website or for our business (such as website or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, communications providers, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, credit card processing companies and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf). Third-party service providers are contractually restricted from using or disclosing the information, except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. Data may be processed in the European Union, the United States, India or Israel depending upon contractual requirements and in accordance with legal jurisdictions for the region(s) to which Media Defined is subject. 

#### 2\. Aggregated statistics

We may disclose non-personally identifiable aggregated statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in and use of our Website and e-mails to third parties in the form of aggregated data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user. Information relating to aggregated statistics will be collected through the use of third-party cookies and other third-party tracking devices. 

#### 3\. Legally compelled disclosures

We may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary (a) to conform to the law, comply with a judicial or court order or comply with legal processes served on us or Affiliated Parties; (b) to protect and defend our rights and property, the Website, the users of the Website and/or our Affiliated Parties; or (c) to act as needed under the circumstances to protect the safety of users of our Website, ourselves or third parties. Consent to worldwide transfer and processing of Personal Information (applies unless otherwise agreed in writing between you or your organization and Media Defined) By providing Personal Information to us through this Website, you agree that it may be used by us and our Affiliated Parties for the purposes described herein, and you further understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories, which may have different privacy laws from your country of residence, and which may afford varying levels of protection for your Personal Information. Regardless of the laws in place in these countries, we will treat the privacy of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By providing your Personal Information to this Website, you consent to us transmitting and processing your information in any jurisdiction, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

#### Third-party websites

When you are on this Website, you may have the opportunity to visit or link to other websites, including other websites operated by us or by unaffiliated third parties. These websites may collect Personal Information about you, and (because this Privacy Policy does not address the information practices of those other websites) you should review the privacy policies of such other websites to see how they treat your personal information. 

#### Privacy of minors

This Website is not directed at children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen on our Website. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of thirteen on our Website, we will delete the information from our records. 

#### Security

We use commercially reasonable and industry-standard physical, management and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information. We also use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when transmitting sensitive information. Whilst we endeavor to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information provided to this Website, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, either during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. If you contact us by e-mail or a "Contact us" or similar feature on the Website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. An unaffiliated third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. We accept no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts by third parties during or after transmission. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If notification is appropriate, we shall endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and (insofar as we have your e-mail address) we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you would prefer us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at info@mediadefined.com with the alternative contact information you would like us to use. 

#### Updates to our privacy statement

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically and without prior notice to reflect changes in our online information practices. We will post a prominent notice on this Website to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy Statement and indicate at the top of the statement when it was most recently updated.
