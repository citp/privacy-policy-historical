<p style="font-weight: bold;text-align:center;text-decoration:underline;">NET DETECTIVE PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p><a href="http://www.standard.netdetective.net">NetDetective.net</a> and <a href="http://www.HDPublishing.com">HDPublishing.com</a> (collectively
    the "Site") is owned by HD Publishing Group ("Net
    Detective").  This Privacy Policy governs Net Detective’s
    ("we", "us" or "Net Detective") treatment of
    personally identifiable information that Net Detective collects when you use
    the Site.  By visiting the Site, you accept this Privacy Policy.  Net
    Detective values your privacy and is dedicated to protecting your personal
    information and providing you with Notice, Consent, Security and Access. </p>
<p><b>INFORMATION
    WE COLLECT</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tracking Technology:</span> Net Detective logs
    IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) in
    order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Site. We may track
    your movement within the Site, the pages from which you were referred, access
    times and browser types. We only use this information in aggregate to gauge the
    effectiveness of our Site, track information for statistical purposes and to
    improve the products and services we provide and do not link that information
    to you personally.  We store information that we collect through cookies,
    log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources for instance to verify your
    address or update your information and to create a "profile" of your
    preferences.  We tie your personally identifiable information to
    information in the profile, in order to improve the content of the Site for
    you.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer
    for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this Site. We use session ID
    cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier
    for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you
    browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period
    of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in
    your Internet browser’s "help" file.  Persistent cookies are
    used to differentiate users of our Site from subscribers of our service to
    customize the content of certain sections of the website and enable us to track
    and target the interests of our subscribers and to enhance the experience on
    our Site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability
    to use some areas of our Site may be limited and you may not be able to use
    certain features of the Site.   </p>
<p>Net Detective adds to its online database (which
    is available to all members) information concerning and limited to member’
    names, address, email, and phone numbers obtained through the registration
    process.  If for any reason, a member does not wish to have said
    information included within the database they may contact us as set forth below
    in CHOICE AND OPT OUT.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Links:</span> We encourage you to be
    aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and
    every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy
    statement applies only to information collected by our Site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertisements:</span> We may from time to time
    use various outside ad-serving companies to serve advertisements on our Site.
    In the process of serving advertisements, the ad serving companies may place a
    cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information about your visits
    to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this Site and
    other websites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. By
    delivering ads on our site, the ad-server is able to record what ads a user --
    identified by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what pages the user was
    viewing when the ads were delivered. This web usage information is combined
    with other ad delivery information the ad-server has collected from your visits
    to our Site and other sites not affiliated with Net Detective.  This
    non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad-serving
    process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see online at our
    Site and other sites not affiliated with Net Detective.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surveys or Promotions:</span> From time to time
    we may provide you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes or other
    promotions on our Site, which might be sponsored or conducted by a third
    party.  If you participate, we will request certain personally
    identifiable information from you. Participation in these promotions is
    completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose
    this information.  The requested information typically includes contact
    information. If there is a third party sponsor involved please make sure to
    review that party’s privacy policy. </p>
<p><b>USE OF
    PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>We do not sell or market, knowingly solicit
    information from, or sell Net Detective to anyone who is under 18.  We
    receive and store any personal information you enter on our Site or give to us
    in any other way. We may also receive information from you from other sources.
    We receive and store information you provide voluntarily on the Site.  </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendors:</span> We employ other companies and
    individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples might include sending
    e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data,
    providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links, and
    merchant processing functions. They may have access to personal information
    needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Offers:</span>  We share
    personally identifiable information with third parties in order to have them
    send you special offers and promotions that we think you might find of interest
    to you. We will also occasionally send you information on products, services,
    special deals, or promotions, which we have found that may be of interest to
    you. If you do not want us to use the information you provide in order to
    inform you of products and services that might be of interest to you, or to
    provide your information to third party companies please let us know by

    information to contact you about the services on our Site in which you have
    expressed an interest, for example, if you have contacted customer service or
    made an inquiry.</p>
<p>Service-related Announcements: We will send you
    strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary
    to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance,
    or the delivery of a service is delayed we might send you an email, or if there
    is some service issue with something you might have ordered. Generally, you may
    not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exceptional Circumstances:</span> If the HD
    Publishing Group or any of its lines of businesses or affiliated companies, is
    sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or
    otherwise, the relevant databases of Net Detective could, in whole or in part,
    be sold as part of that transaction. Therefore, information about the users of
    our Site, including personal information, will be disclosed as part of any
    merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the Site, our
    services or sale or pledge of our company assets as well as in the event of an
    insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be
    transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Information about our
    users, including personal information, may also need to be disclosed in
    connection with a commercial transaction where HD Publishing Group, or an
    affiliate, is seeking financing, investment, support or funding.  In such
    transactions, personal information will be subject to the promises made in any
    pre-existing Privacy Policy in effect when the information was obtained. We
    also may have to release personally identifying information when it is
    necessary to comply with judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants,
    orders, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Net Detective’s users
    or others.  </p>
<p>NET DETECTIVE ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR
    LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO ANY THEFT, LOSS, ALTERATION OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL OR
    OTHER INFORMATION LAWFULLY PROVIDED BY NET DETECTIVE TO THIRD PARTIES, OR WITH

    AGREEMENT BETWEEN THAT THIRD PARTY AND NET DETECTIVE.</p>
