In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your professional interests, demographics and more detailed contact preferences.

Netstarter uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service, whether as a visitor of the firm, contact or client.

We will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable.

As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us and we will do everything we can to honour such requests. 

Your permission is always secured first, should we ever share your information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy.
