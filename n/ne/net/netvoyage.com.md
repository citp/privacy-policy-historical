# Privacy Policy

NetDocuments Software, Inc. is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy by developing and deploying technology which gives you a powerful and safe online experience.  This policy outlines what we do to meet those commitments.

**Differentiating Between the NetDocuments Service and the NetDocuments Website.**  The website [www.netdocuments.com](http://www.netdocuments.com/) is provided as a means to convey information to you about the NetDocuments Service. The website contains literature, demos, company information, etc. From the [www.netdocuments.com](http://www.netdocuments.com/) site, you can choose to opt-in to receive literature and information which will be used to communicate with you related to your interest.

Once you register for the NetDocuments Service, you can access the NetDocuments Service directly via the link provided when you registered, for example, [https://vault.netvoyage.com](https://vault.netvoyage.com/), bypassing the [www.netdocuments.com](http://www.netdocuments.com/) site, if you choose. All personally identifiable information collected to create your account is stored under your account within the Service and can be changed by you at any time by logging into the NetDocuments Service, selecting Settings, and Personal Information.

**NetDocuments Service.**   NetDocuments provides a highly-secure, Cloud-based, multi-tenant, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Document Management Service (DMS or "Service") to its customers.  As a SaaS DMS provider, NetDocuments is responsible for protecting the privacy of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) it gathers from its customers to create and maintain Service accounts, referred to in this policy as "customer PII."  NetDocuments is also responsible for the privacy of data which customers of NetDocuments place in the customer DMS data repositories, referred to as "customer data" and "Customer Data Files" or "CDFs."

**Protecting Personally Identifiable Information.**   In matters related to how customer PII is used and maintained, NetDocuments agrees to be subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Department of Commerce, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Transportation, or any other U.S. authorized statutory body as applicable.  If there is an incident related to customer PII, NetDocuments accepts the possibility, under certain conditions, for the customer to invoke binding arbitration.  Customer need to know that NetDocuments may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.  NetDocuments may, depending on the circumstances, have liability in any cases of onward transfers of customer PII to third parties.

NetDocuments complies with the **U.S. - E.U.   Privacy Shield** Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.

NetDocuments has further committed to cooperate with the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from NetDocuments, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact the EU DPAs for more information or to file a complaint.  The services of the EU DPAs are provided at no cost to you.

**Personally Identifiable Information Collected.**  No information that can uniquely identify an individual is gathered by merely visiting the www.netdocuments.com   website. Personally identifiable information is only collected when you are registered for a NetDocuments Service account.  This information gathered to create a service account is as follows:

  * Name
  * Email address
  * Phone number
  * Organization name
  * Credit card information (Credit card information for the subscribing organization is collected using SSL encrypted pages and is only required when services are purchased. Credit card information is not stored online)



**Use of Personally Identifiable Information.**  We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone, except as described in this privacy policy (see "Business Transitions" below). We may share personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when:

  1. Verification services need to do credit card checks, etc.
  2. We find that your actions on our web sites violate the Terms of Use.
  3. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process serviced on our Web site.



We do not share information with any third parties for their own marketing purposes.

Within the NetDocuments Service, only other registered users can view your name, email, telephone, organization, etc. to assist them in identification for the purpose of sharing documents with you.

Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. _To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at  _[https://support.netdocuments.com](https://support.netdocuments.com/). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**Opt-Out Options** NetDocuments is required to offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personal information is (i) to be disclosed to a third party or (ii) to be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individuals.  If an individual desires to opt out of having their personally identifiable information used in the ways described in this policy, or in any subsequent manner proposed by NetDocuments, that individual may contact NetDocuments at [https://support.netdocuments.com](https://support.netdocuments.com/) and request to have the individual’s personally identifiable information removed or not used as appropriate to the situation.  Individuals may also contact the NetDocuments Compliance Department at [compliance@netdocuments.com](mailto:compliance@netdocuments.com) to initiate or ensure any opt-out request.

**Privacy Obligations Regarding Customer Data Files within the NetDocuments DMS.**

All data files which a customer uploads into the NetDocuments Service or creates within the Service remain the property of the customer.  NetDocuments is only a custodian for the customer data files.  All customer data files are encrypted in transit and at rest and are safely stored in highly secure data centers.  The customer controls all access to and use of the customer data files.  NetDocuments personnel have no access to customer data files except when explicitly granted by the customer.  NetDocuments has no knowledge regarding the content of customer data files.  This means customers assume responsibility for meeting Privacy Shield obligations and any other obligations or restrictions for how customer data files are used.  NetDocuments' responsibility is to provide a robust, highly secure DMS for its customers.

Within the DMS, your Documents are protected with industry-leading security. If you are a registered user of the NetDocuments Service our security system ensures that no one can access your documents except those with whom you choose to share them, which may include other employees or associates of your company, and your DMS Administrators. The NetDocuments Service has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information provided to the Service. The DMS servers are maintained in secure, safe, trusted and audited environments. Credit card information for the subscribing organization is collected using SSL encrypted pages and is only required when services are purchased. Credit card information is not stored online.

If you have questions or concerns about how customer data files may be stored by NetDocuments, you may contact our Compliance Department by sending an email to compliance@netdocuments.com or by telephoning 866-NET-DOCS (866-638-3627).
