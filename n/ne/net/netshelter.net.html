                                Consumer      privacy is of paramount importance to NetShelter Inc.      ("NetShelter"), our advertisers, and the Web publishers in our      network. NetShelter is committed to protecting the privacy of consumers,      publishers, and advertisers, and to do our part to maintain the integrity      of the Internet. <br>
                                <br>
                                The      following statement outlines NetShelter's policies and principles regarding      online privacy.<br>
                                <br>
                                    <strong>Internet Consumer Data Collected      by NetShelter </strong><br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong><br>
                                  When a consumer responds to an Internet advertisement served by NetShelter      (running through our network of websites or in an email advertisement),      NetShelter may collect personally identifiable information (e.g. name,      address, zip code, e-mail address, gender, birth date) regarding the      consumer who responded to the ad and who completed a form in order to      receive various information, offers, etc. In all cases where such      information is collected, it is done so only if the consumer voluntarily,      knowingly and explicitly provided such information. <br>
                                  By      providing this information and their permission to receive communications      from our marketing partners, consumers are agreeing to allow NetShelter to      make their personally identifiable information available to the company      sponsoring the advertisement, as well as to other trusted third parties in      accordance with the terms of this privacy policy. As a result, these      consumers may receive information on additional products, services and      offers that may be of interest to them. NetShelter and/or our marketing      partners may enhance and/or merge personally identifiable information about      consumers, who have specifically requested to receive marketing communications,      with commercially-available third party data collected from other sources      in an effort to ensure that the messages being sent to the consumer in      online and/or offline marketing programs are relevant to their interests.      In the event we enhance and/or merge such personally identifiable      information with data collected from other sources, we will take reasonable      steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information. <br>
                                  NetShelter      may share personally identifiable information (including information that      has been enhanced with information from other sources) with advertisers,      third party marketers and our affiliates for their online and/or offline      marketing programs. While NetShelter strongly encourages clients and      partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, NetShelter is      not responsible for the information practices of clients or their partners.      The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners      are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from      NetShelter's policy. <br>
                                  <br>
                                  <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) </strong><br>
                                  When a consumer responds to an Internet advertisement served by NetShelter      (running through our network of websites or in an email transmission),      NetShelter collects certain technical data (Type of Browser, Operating      System, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date and time of when an      Internet consumer has responded to an advertisement, etc.). This type of      information is defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (see Network      Advertising Initiative section below) as Non-Personally Identifiable      Information (Non-PII) "ad delivery and reporting data". This      means that none of the data can be linked to any individual Internet      consumer, and therefore it cannot be used for profiling purposes. <br>
                                  NetShelter      retains all ad delivery and reporting data indefinitely, for accounting and      auditing purposes.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  <strong>Consumer Choices Concerning Data      Collection </strong><br>
                                  <br>
                                  <strong>Ad management and Reporting Data - Use of Cookies</strong><br>
                                  When a consumer views an ad served by NetShelter, they are assigned a      unique - but not personally-identifiable - number, known as a cookie, which      is recorded and stored on their computer in their web browser's cookie      file. Cookies do not harm Internet consumer's computers. While cookies are      not essential to NetShelter's continued success, they do help us to reach      several of our key goals, such as providing Internet users with a more      fulfilling, results oriented experience on the web, reducing the repetition      of advertising, and increasing the amount of relevant material viewed by      Internet consumers. <br>
                                  <br>
                                  <strong>Remove and Disable Option </strong><br>
                                  You have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in      your browser. Please see your browser supplier's website for details on how      to do this. <br>
                                  <strong>Security Precautions </strong><br>
                                  <br>
                                  NetShelter makes every effort to maintain the security of its network and      the data we collect. Any data that is stored on NetShelter's server is      treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public.      NetShelter has a strict internal security policy with respect to the      confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those      employees or third parties who have a need to know such information for the      purpose of effectively delivering NetShelter products and services. <br>
                                  <br>

                                  <strong>NetShelter and Client Website Privacy Policy Statements</strong><br>
                                  NetShelter requests that website publishers belonging to our advertising      network consent to and comply with the standards of online privacy, as      outlined by the Online Privacy Alliance (OPA). <br>
                                  Also,      in accordance with the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), NetShelter      strongly encourages all websites within our network to create privacy      policy statements and to provide Internet consumers with conspicuous access      to their statements. Additionally, NetShelter requests that all website      publishers doing business with NetShelter disclose any and all information      that is being collected from Internet consumers on their website, including      data gathered from banners and other forms of advertising being served on      their website. Finally, NetShelter encourages the websites in our network      to provide links to all advertisers gathering information from Internet      consumers in their respective privacy statements. Please note that the      NetShelter's privacy policy applies only to the information we collect and      not to that collected by sites with which we may do business. We encourage      you to always read the privacy policies of the sites you visit. If you have      particular concerns about any website advertising with NetShelter with      respect to privacy issues, please contact privacy@NetShelter.net. <br>
                                  <br>
                                  <strong>Children's Privacy</strong> <br>
                                  As of April 21, 2000 the children's Online Privacy Protection Act      ("COPPA") became effective. The regulations apply to the online      collection of personal information from children under the age of 13.      NetShelter is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes      every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet.      NetShelter's web site, products, and services are not developed for or      directed at children. Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of      13 to do business with us. If you believe your child has provided      NetShelter with any personally identifiable data by registering at      NetShelter's web site, please contact privacy@NetShelter.net to have them      removed. <br>
                                  We      also request that all websites using our advertising network disclose in      their privacy statements any and all information regarding the collection      of information from children. <br>
                                  <br>
                                  <strong>Involvement with Industry Partners </strong><br>
                                  NetShelter is committed to helping protect consumer privacy on the Internet      and, as such, we actively monitor consumer privacy issues. Further evidence      of NetShelter's commitment to consumer privacy is our involvement with the      following privacy advocacy groups: <br>
