A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website   transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk   so that the website can remember who you are. </p>
                        <p>A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the   cookie has come, the 'lifetime' of the cookie, and a value, usually a   randomly generated unique number. </p>
                        <p><em>Two types of cookies are used on this website : </em></p>

                        <p><strong>persistent cookies</strong> - these remain in the cookie file of   your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the   lifetime of the specific cookie).</p>
