Such vendors may have access to certain Personally Identifiable Information on a need to know basis for evaluating Authorized Customers for service eligibility. Net Wide Directory privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this information. Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law: Net Wide Directory will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to comply with a court order or subpoena or a request from a law enforcement agency to release information.

**What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?**  
Net Wide Directory will let Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to the privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if Net Wide Directory is changing the privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, Net Wide Directory will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure.
