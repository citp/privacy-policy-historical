# NetEnt Privacy Policy (EU) | NetEnt | Better Gaming

**INTRODUCTION**

** ** NetEnt respects the privacy of everyone who uses our website netent.com including its subpages  **(“Website”)**  and/or plays our casino games  **(“Games”)**  which can be played via customers of ours  **(“Operators”)**.

In this document we call the NetEnt group of companies “ **NetEnt Group** ”, and each NetEnt legal entity “ **NetEnt** ” or “ **us** ”/“ **we** ” and we call you (a visitor/user of our site or a player of our Games) “ **you** ”.

This document explains how we collect, process and store personal data belonging to you. “ **Personal Data** ” means information about you which can be used, on its own or together with other information, to identify you as a person.

**  
ROLES**

A  **“Controller”** decides why and how Personal Data is processed. The Controller can ask another company to process the Personal Data on its behalf and as instructed by the Controller. That company then becomes a “ **Processor** ”.

This document only applies where a company in the NetEnt Group is Controller. The Operator is Controller for Personal Data collected through the Operator and in the Games when you play them via an Operator (ex. data you provide when you register as a player, transaction data etc.). In those cases, the Operator’s privacy policy applies.

Emails from you | Records of correspondence we have with you | NetEnt AB (publ.) | Contacting you (example: to respond to a question from you)  | Processing of emails is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by NetEnt and emails will consequently be stored as long as NetEnt can claim lawfulness of such correspondence, 

unless such interests could be deemed overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.

**OTHER USE**

In addition to the purposes listed in the table, we may always use your Personal Data as required by law and regulation (example: to maintain and protect the gaming licenses of the NetEnt Group).

**OTHER SHARING**

We share your Personal Data with third parties (for example, NetEnt Group companies or third-party suppliers) as follows:

  * When you have given your consent;
  * as necessary in order to provide the Website (example: third-party internet service providers);
  * as necessary in order to provide the Games (example: third-party hosting providers);
  * as necessary in order to communicate with you (example: third party email program providers);
  * to carry out your instructions;
  * in the circumstances where your data is on an anonymous and aggregated basis, meaning you could not be personally identified from it;
  * as permitted by law or regulation;
  * in order to comply with any legal obligation, in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions or to protect the rights, property, or safety of NetEnt or the Operators (example: third-party gaming regulators); and
  * in the event that there is a sale of the assets of NetEnt or corporate restructuring, or as a result of a change of control of NetEnt or one of its group companies, or in preparation of any of these events. Any third party to which NetEnt’s assets are transferred will have the right to continue to use the Personal Data as set out in this document.



Except for these circumstances, we will not sell or share your information to any third party.

**KEEP**

We may keep your Personal Data after we have stopped providing services to you if it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes and/or prevent fraud or abuse. We may also keep anonymized derivatives of your data for business analytics purposes where no automated decision making is involved.

**TRANSFER**

Since the NetEnt Group is multinational, your Personal Data may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”). The Personal Data may be hosted on servers outside EEA. Your Personal Data may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who works for us, or for another company within the NetEnt Group, or for one of our suppliers.

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Data is treated securely and in accordance with this document when transferring the Data.

**PROTECT**

** ** We have appropriate technical and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction or loss, modifications, unauthorised use, disclosure or access, and all other unlawful forms of processing.

Since the internet is not a completely secure environment we can’t guarantee that information you transmit via our Website or Games will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards or otherwise. We will of course follow applicable rules and processes for notifying you if this should happen.
