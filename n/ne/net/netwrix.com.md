# Privacy Policy

### Introduction

We are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. We have established this Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information. Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit our Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. We strive to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, we intend to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained. 

### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics. 

### Security

Wherever your Personal Information may be held within our company or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. 

### Access/Accuracy

To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, we wish to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting us should you need to update or correct that Information. If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your Personal Information to us and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal Information that we hold as soon as practicable. 

### Third Party Services

Third parties provide certain services available on this web site. We may provide information, including Personal Information that we collect on the Web to third-party service providers to help us deliver programs, products, information, and services. Service providers are also an important means by which we maintain our Web site and mailing lists. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on our behalf. We do not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on our behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against our policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent. 

### Partners and Affiliates

We may transfer some parts of the collected information to our partners and affiliates. Partners play an important role in our operations: they help us market, sell and support our products and services. We take applicable steps to ensure that our partners and affiliates are required to protect your Personal Information on our behalf. 

### Children's Privacy

We are not structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age. 

### Your Consent

By using this Web site, you consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy and to our processing of Personal Information for the purposes given above as well as those explained where we collect Personal Information on the Web. 

### Your California Privacy Rights
