# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

We are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. We have established this Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information. Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit our Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. We strive to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, we intend to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained. 

## Our Uses of Personal Information

We collection Personal Information including contact information (such as name, email address, and phone number) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date and security code), when you purchase or download our software products through our Website using a credit or debit card. Please note that Netwrix does not directly collect or store your financial account information – instead, we use a reputable company (the "Payment Processing Company") to collect and process your payment information. Rest assured, however, that we have taken steps to ensure that the Payment Processing Company protects Personal Information it collects from you in compliance with our Privacy Policy. We use the Personal Information we collect from you in connection with processing your order and providing you with support (if you have purchased support) and other information related to the product you have purchased/downloaded. We may also collect Personal Information when you contact us with questions, comments or requests for information and we will use the information you provide in such communications to respond to you. We may use the Personal Information you provide at the time of product purchase/download to periodically send news, bulletins or other marketing information to you. If we choose to send such marketing communications, you will have the ability to opt out of receiving some of them. 

## Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics. 

## Security

Wherever your Personal Information may be held within our company or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. 

## Access/Accuracy

To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, we wish to maintain accurate Personal Information. Where we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting us should you need to update or correct that Information. If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your Personal Information to us and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal Information that we hold as soon as practicable. 

## Opting Out

Because we respect privacy rights, we allow you to opt out of receiving certain information. If we choose to send news, bulletins or other marketing information or communications to you, we will provide you with the ability to decline, or opt out of, receiving such communications, and we will take reasonable steps to comply with such requests in a timely manner. Instructions for opting out will be provided if and when we determine to send such a communication.

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on our behalf. We do not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on our behalf unless such transfer is legally required.

Partners play an important role in our operations: they help us market, sell and support our products and services. We take applicable steps to ensure that our partners and affiliates are required to protect your Personal Information on our behalf.
