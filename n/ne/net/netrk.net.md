In addition, cookies enable us to measure the frequency of website views and general navigation. Legal basis is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interests in the use of cookies consist of the aforementioned purposes of improving our internet presence. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer system. Please note that some of these cookies are transferred from our server to your computer system, which are mostly so-called “session cookies”. “Session cookies” are characterized by the fact that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive after the end of the browser session. We only use those cookies to conduct/provide the services requested by the user. The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interests in processing data in such a way are to optimize website settings for the device you use and to customize the user interface. Other cookies remain on your computer system and allow us to recognize your computer system next time you visit (so-called “persistent cookies”). Of course you can refuse cookies at any time if your browser allows you to do so.

### 6\. Use of Google Analytics

Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google). Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity for website operators and to provide other services related to website activity and internet use. Google may also transfer this information to third parties if required by law or as far as third parties process this data on behalf of Google. In no case, will Google link your IP address with other Google data.

Alternatively, you can use the Google Analytics opt-out add-on (<http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>), if it is available for your browser.

Please note that this website uses Google Analytics with an IP anonymization extension and therefore IP addresses are only further processed in an abbreviated form in order to avoid direct references to individuals.
