**What personal identifying information (and other information) does NetZero collect from you?**

In order to provide the Services, NetZero collects two types of information from its subscribers and visitors: personally identifiable information and aggregated information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience while using the Services.

  *  **Personal Information** We collect personal identifying information (including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number and e-mail address), demographic information (including, but not limited to, age, household size, income level, education level and gender), financial information (including, but not limited to, credit card information) and psychographic information (including, but not limited to, reason for Internet use, reason for use of NetZero and topics of interest to you) when you register for and use the NetZero Service and other NetZero programs. 
  * **Non-Personal and Aggregated Information** This refers to information that is not personally identifiable. We automatically gather certain information about you based upon your activity on the Site or the way you use the Service. We also collect machine data such as processor type, processor speed, operating system type, browser type, audio devices, modem devices, video cards and any software on your computer that may interact or interfere with our Software or Service. This information may include the web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. For instance, we may know that ten thousand people visit this Privacy Statement today, but we do not know their names or addresses so they are anonymous to us. NetZero also uses this information to do internal research on our visitors' demographics, interests and behavior to better understand and serve our visitors.

 **Where do we collect information from you?**

  * We collect personal identifying information on the NetZero Site. We collect this, and other information, as part of NetZero's MyNetZero start page and, if you request, information regarding advertising services provided by NetZero or other information from the Investor Relations portion of our Site.  
We also collect information from visitors to our Site regarding the referring Uniform Resource Locator ("URL"), your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, which browser you used to come to the Site and the pages of our Site that you viewed during your visit. An URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a TCP/IP network. TCP/IP stands for "Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol," and is the suite of communications protocols used to connect hosts on the Internet. Networks using the TCP/IP protocol route messages based on the IP address of the destination. 
  * **NetZero Service**. During the NetZero Service registration process we ask subscribers to provide personal identifying, demographic and psychographic information. The information you provide during registration is placed in your NetZero personal profile. You may access or change your NetZero personal profile information at any time. In addition, you may provide other personal identifying information and financial information, such as a credit card number and other credit card verification information if you choose to enter such information in order to purchase additional time on the Service or in order to use other NetZero Services. NetZero may update the information in your NetZero Personal Profile with information obtained through generally accepted methods of address verification. You may access your NetZero Personal Profile information at any time. See the section below entitled: **"How may you access or update your information?"**

While you are using the NetZero Service or have our Software installed, we collect non-personally identifiable information including, without limitation, information regarding the Web sites you visit, your interactions with those sites, the telephone number used to log in to the Service and any software on your computer that may interact or interfere with our Software or Service. Our Service implements our own unique technology which builds a database of the types of sites you visit while you are online. This information is ultimately stored in the form of categories and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our Service, servers and software, and to administer our Site. 

  * **Online Surveys, Contests and Sweepstakes.** When you participate in an online survey or interactive poll, we will ask you for your demographic information (like your zip code, age or income level) and your hobbies and interests in order to track voting. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we will ask you for contact information (like your e-mail address) and demographic information (like your zip code, age, or income level) in order to administer the contest and notify winners. 
  * **Contact Information and Third Party Data.** If you contact NetZero by e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your personal correspondence. Thus, if you report a problem with our Site, we may collect such information in a file specific to you. Moreover, if you contact us through our feedback area, we require your name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply. Additionally, if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our Site, we may keep the information in a file specific to you.

 **How is your information used?**

NetZero uses the information it collects to provide you with more relevant services, online shopping, third party offers, surveys and advertising. To accomplish this we perform research on the demographic, psychographic and other information we collect.

We also collect information regarding the referring URL, your IP address, which browser you used to come to the Site and the pages of our Site that you viewed during your visit. We use this information to better understand the habits and methods our subscribers use to reach our Site and how we may better serve the needs of our subscribers and visitors. 
  * **NetZero Service**. NetZero uses personal identifying information to confirm or clarify submitted information and to provide our subscribers with updated information about our company and services. Demographic and psychographic information is used to tailor a subscribers experience of our service, such as by displaying advertisements and content that might be of interest to the subscriber. NetZero will not disclose any personal identifying information about any subscriber to a third party unless the subscriber consents to the disclosure, or except as may be required by law, governmental authority or to cooperate with law enforcement authorities. NetZero will, on occasion, share such information in aggregate form with advertisers so that they can target advertisements to groups of subscribers. Our Service implements our own unique technology which builds a database of the types of sites you visit while you are online. This information is ultimately stored in the form of categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs.

NetZero may share, in aggregate form, information it collects from these surveys with its advertisers, partners and the general public. 

NetZero may run contests, sweepstakes and other promotions on its Site or through its Service, in which we may request entrants to provide personal or contact information. In some cases, entrants may be required to answer survey questions about a range of topics. NetZero uses the information collected in the entry form to verify the entrant's identity, age and to communicate with entrants. NetZero will not share any of the entrant's personal or contact information with any third party, unless disclosed at the time of entry, if you are a contest winner or as may be required by law. NetZero may make information about entrants available in aggregated form to advertisers, partners and the general public. NetZero will not knowingly permit children under 13 to participate in contests or sweepstakes. 

  * **Contact Information and Third Party Data**. NetZero uses this information to respond to your inquiry, and to enable third-party partners to let us know that you have contacted them.

 **A note about the privacy of children aged 13 to 18**.

We collect, use, and disclose information about children aged 13 to 18 in the same manner as we do for adults. NetZero believes that it's especially important to protect children's privacy online and encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate and monitor their Internet activity. If you are under 18, we recommend you get your parent's permission before disclosing any information about yourself to anyone on the Internet. We do not filter advertisements or other content that children may receive, and they could receive content and materials from the Internet and/or advertising that are inappropriate for children. We provide a listing of third party services that offer parental control software that is located at: [www.netzero.net/support/info/safety.html.](https://web.archive.org/web/20041229181823id_/http%3A//www.netzero.net/legal/www.netzero.net/support/info/safety.html)
