Netvibes maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, modification and destruction.  As part of those safeguards, Netvibes employs sophisticated technology designed to protect Personal Data during its transmission and prevent transmission errors or unauthorized acts of third parties.  However, while Netvibes strives to protect Your Personal Data, in light of the inevitable risks of data transmission over the internet, Netvibes cannot guarantee full protection against any error occurring during the course of Personal Data transmission that is beyond Netvibes' reasonable control.

Since Personal Data may be confidential, access is limited to employees, contractors and resellers of 3DS Group Companies who have a need to know such data in carrying out their tasks.
