The purpose of this “Privacy Policy” is to inform all individuals from whom Personal Data is collected by Dassault Systèmes ("You" or "Your") how Dassault Systèmes collects and uses such Personal Data and how You can control its use.

**I. Scope of this privacy policy**

This Privacy Policy sets forth the principles and guidelines governing the protection of Your Personal Data (as defined below) including the Personal Data collected on or through the Site.

Dassault Systèmes collects Personal Data either online (including via email) or offline and this Privacy Policy is applicable regardless of the means of collection or processing.

Personal data ("Personal Data") means any information relating to an identified or identifiable person. An identifiable person is a person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to the person.

Non-Personal Data means any information that does not result in the identification of a person.

For visitors and users of the Site, the Sites Terms of Services are incorporated into this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Site and any Personal Data You provide on the Site are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and those Terms of Services.

**II. Data collected**

Personal Data below likely includes:

  *  title
  *  first and last name
  *  postal address
  *  email address
  *  telephone number(s)
  *  login and password
  * type of organization (company, school, university, etc.), organization name, organization size, department and job title;
  * people to whom purchases are shipped;
  * financial data (credit card number and expiry date, name and address of the cardholder);
  * IP address;
  * Cookies (as described in section 10); and
  * any other Personal Data as may be relevant for the purposes listed below.



In all cases, however, the Personal Data gathered is limited to data necessary for the purposes described in Article 4 below.

For visitors and users of the Site: In order to use certain functions and features of the Site, Dassault Systèmes requires that You provide certain Personal Data when visiting or using the Site.

However, if You choose not to provide all or part of this Personal Data, the purposes as described in Article 4 hereafter might not be achieved or not properly achieved, some areas and functions of the Site may not function properly and/or You may be refused access to certain pages on the Site. In particular, You will not be authorized to purchase other services via the Site.

**III.   Protection of personal data concerning children**

Dassault Systèmes services are not designed to be marketed to children who are considered as minor under the applicable data protection law and Dassault Systèmes does not knowingly collect or store Personal Data from children under such age.  For children whose usual place of residence is in the European Union, Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, the default age at which a person is no longer considered a child is 16 subject to local law to adjust that limit between 13 and 16.

Certain Dassault Systèmes services may be appropriate for use by children, however, in which case children below the age of consent under local data protection laws must seek consent from their parents or guardians prior to creating a Netvibes account or registering a product. Teachers and school administrators may act in the place of parents and guardians and provide consent for the collection of Personal Data from children (schools should always ensure that they have received permission from parents or guardians to do so).

If parents or guardians become aware that their child has provided Dassault Systèmes with Personal Data without their consent or without a teacher’s or school administrator’s consent, they can ask Dassault Systèmes to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account by sending a request at  _<http://www.netvibes.com/en/contact-us>_.

If Dassault Systèmes becomes aware that it has collected Personal Data from a child below the age of consent under local data protection laws without consent from a parent or guardian, Dassault Systèmes will take steps to seek the parent’s or guardians consent for that processing or to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account.
