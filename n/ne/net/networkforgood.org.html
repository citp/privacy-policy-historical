<span class="tXLargePriBold">Network for Good Privacy and Security </span>

<p>Network for Good and all of our partners value and 
respect all individuals and organizations seeking to donate time, 
money, or resources to groups in need. We understand that you may be 
concerned about privacy issues that surround the use of the Internet.

</p><p>We believe that you should have control over who receives your 
personal information, whether it concerns where you live, what your 
interests are, or how you choose to conduct transactions. We're 
focused on only one thing: helping you help others in a safe and 
secure environment.

</p><p>Therefore, we do not disclose, share, sell, or trade information 
about your individual visits to Network for Good or the information 
that you may give us such as your name, address, e-mail address or 
telephone number, to any outside companies except for the use of 
completing a donation transaction that you initiate or a request to 
volunteer with a nonprofit organization. We will release personal 
information about you, if necessary, in order to comply with valid 
legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order.

</p><p>Other Web sites that you may link to from our site, including our 
partners' Web sites, have their own privacy policies. Network for 
Good is not responsible for the privacy practices of other Web sites. 
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of Web sites before 
providing them with any of your personal information.


</p><p><b>How Network for Good Uses Information About You</b><br>
When you make donations or select a volunteer opportunity, we may 
specifically ask for information about you -- such as name, home or 
Internet address, and billing information -- in order to provide that 
service or information to you. This information will be used solely 
for the purposes of completing your donation or locating the 
volunteer opportunity you are seeking.

</p><p>Your personal information will be shared with the organization to 
whom you are donating unless you choose not to make it available to 
them. When you make an online donation, you will have the opportunity 
to keep your personal information private by electing to make your 
donation anonymously. If you do elect to provide your name and 
information to the charity, that organization will likely retain your 
name and may use it for future solicitations. They may also provide 
it to other organizations for their use. If you do not want to be 
contacted again by that charity or want to make sure that the 
organization you have given money to does not share your name, you 
will need to let them know directly. For more information on making 
an online donation, visit our Help area.

</p><p>The information which Network for Good automatically gathers, such as 
the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its areas, is 
used only in the aggregate -- very much like television ratings that 
tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program.  This 
collective data helps us determine how much our visitors use parts of 
the site, so that we can improve our site to assure that it is as 
appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. We also 
may provide aggregated statistical "ratings" information, never 
information about you personally, to our Network for Good partners 
about how our visitors, collectively, use Network for Good. We do 
this so they too can understand how often people use their areas and 
our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible 
experience.


</p><p><b>Network for Good Security</b><br>
Network for Good takes every precaution to protect our users' 
information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web 
site, your information is protected both online and offline.
</p><p>
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive 
information (such as credit card number and/or social security 
number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best 
encryption software in the industry. Network for Good uses Secure 
Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to keep your personal information as 
secure as possible. Network for Good helps to protect your 
information by working with partners that provide a secure and safe 
environment for credit card donations.

</p><p><span class="tBold">Your Volunteer Record of Service</span><br>
We have asked you to create your Volunteer Record of Service using your e-mail address because it is a unique identifier (no one else has your e-mail address) and because it will be easiest for you to remember. Your e-mail address will not be shared with any third parties and will not be used for any other purpose by Network for Good, unless you indicate that you would like to receive periodic e-mail updates. If you checked the box beside "Send me updates," you will receive periodic e-mail updates.</p>
<p>We realize the data that you enter into your Volunteer Record of Service is information of a personal nature. This data will be treated accordingly with every precaution related to security and privacy as described above. Information concerning specific organizations and your individual volunteer activity on their behalf will not be shared with any other organization, nor will your personal comments and reflections.</p>
<p>Our system automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on our site. We do not use any of this navigational data about where you -- as an individual -- go on the site. Nor do we share any of this data with outside companies. We do use navigational information in the aggregate to understand how our members as a group use the service so that we can improve the site.</p>
<p>If you are a parent and would like your child to create a Volunteer Record of Service, we encourage you to participate in this activity with your child.</p>

<p>If we change our privacy statement, we will post those changes 
prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, 
how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to 
anyone.

</p><p><span class="tXLargePriBold">FAQ</span>

</p><p><b>How do you protect the privacy of individuals?</b><br>
We understand that individuals may be concerned about privacy issues 
that surround the use of the Internet. And, we believe that these 
individuals should have control over who receives their personal 
information, whether it concerns where they live, what their 
interests are, or how they choose to conduct transactions. We do not 
use the personal information that an individual provides, except to 
complete the transaction. Individuals may also choose to make their 
donation anonymously. We never sell, trade, or rent personal 
information to other individuals or companies.

</p><p><b>Are transactions secure?</b><br>
Network for Good uses industry-leading Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
technology to keep personal information as secure as possible. 
Network for Good helps to protect an individual's information by 
working with partners that provide a secure and safe environment for 
credit card donations.

</p><p><b>Can individuals make anonymous donations?</b><br>
Yes. We pass on only the information the individual provides to us if 
that is what the individual authorizes. Read more about privacy and 
security

</p><p><b>What obligation does an organization have to the privacy of people 
who donate through Network for Good?</b><br>
Each organization has its own policies regarding privacy of donor 
information. We encourage concerned individuals to contact charities 
directly to learn about their privacy policies. We will only pass on 
the information individuals provide to us if they authorize us to do 
so.
