Visionael is committed to respecting your privacy. We've structured our website so that, in general, you can visit Visionael online without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer relationship with Visionael. This statement regarding the privacy of the personally identifiable information you provide online covers five main areas: Awareness, Choice, Third Party Sites, Security, and Oversight. 
</p><p>
<b>Awareness </b><br>
Visionael provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy and practices as well as the choices you may make about the way your personal information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and also at the bottom of every Visionael.com web page.  This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.
</p><p>
<b>What we collect</b><br>
On some Visionael web pages, you may make requests, register to receive materials or take part in various product promotions. The types of personal information collected on these pages are name and contact information. In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you, and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences. 
</p><p>
Visionael, like many other commercial web sites, uses a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site.  A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Cookies were originally designed to help a web site distinguish a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you a chance to decide whether to accept it. 
</p><p>
<b>How we use this information</b><br> 
This information helps us to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a request, to communicate back to you and to update you on service and benefits.
From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information that we believe would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such direct marketing or market research contact. We will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register your ownership of Visionael products. 
</p><p>
<b>Who we share it with</b><br>
Visionael will not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other Visionael entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above. Such Visionael entities and/or business partners, including those in the United States, Europe and/or any other countries, are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements. 
</p><p>
<b>Choice</b><br>
Visionael will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. Local country laws and policies are applied where they differ from those in the U.S. 
</p><p>
<b>Third Party Sites</b><br>
Links to third party web sites on the site are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave this site. Visionael has not reviewed all of these third party sites and does not control and is not responsible for any of these sites, their content or their Privacy Policy. Thus, Visionael does not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to this site, you do this entirely at your own risk. 
</p><p>
<b>Security</b><br>
Visionael is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
