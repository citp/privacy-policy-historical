	<h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>

	<p> We receive and store information, including personal information, about you and your use of our service. This information is gathered in a number of ways, including when you enter it on our website and from interactions with our service. Personal information is information that can be used to uniquely identify or contact you. Non-personal information is information that does not permit direct association with you. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. You can choose not to provide personal information we may request of you, but, in general, most of the personal information we request is required in order to provide our service and the lack of such personal information will prevent us from doing so.</p>

	<p>When you interact with us, we may ask you to supply us with personal information so that we can provide, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts. For similar reasons, we may supplement the personal information you provide with publicly available information about you as well as information from other sources, as permitted by law. We use this personal information, for example, to process your registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other topics. We also may use your e-mail address or other methods to send you newsletters, as well as messages about new Netflix features, Netflix special offers, promotional announcements, consumer surveys and other correspondence concerning our service.  If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us, simply access the "<a href="https://www.netflix.com/EmailPreferences">Email preferences</a>" link on the "Your Account" page and uncheck those items to unsubscribe. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your account transactions.</p>

	<p>We keep track of your interactions with us and collect information related to you and your use of our service, including but not limited to: your online activity, title selections, reviews, ratings, payment history, correspondence, Internet protocol addresses, device types, unique device data (such as device identifiers), operating systems, instant watching of movies, TV shows and related activity. We use this information for such purposes as determining your general geographic location, providing localized content, enforcing our terms (such as using device identifiers to determine your eligibility for a free trial), providing recommendations on movies &amp; TV shows we think will be enjoyable, personalizing the service to better reflect particular interests, tracking your instant-watching hours, determining your Internet service provider, helping us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests and otherwise enhancing or administering our service offering for you and other users. We also provide analysis of our users in the aggregate or otherwise in anonymous form to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We may also disclose and otherwise use, on an anonymous basis, movie &amp; TV show ratings, consumption habits, commentary, reviews and other information.   For example, we use movie &amp; TV show ratings and consumption behavior to improve our recommendations to you as well as other users.</p>

	<p>While using the Netflix service, you will have opportunities to post reviews or other information in public forums. Please understand that when you post such information, it is made public and is not subject to this policy.  We are not responsible for any third party's use of information you publicly disclose through our service.</p>

	<p> From time to time, we may partner with companies whose products we believe will interest our members. In conjunction with these partners, we may send promotional announcements and/or serve web-based advertisements on their behalf, as permitted by law. You can go to the "<a href="https://www.netflix.com/EmailPreferences">Email preferences</a>" link on the "Your Account" page and request that your name be excluded from marketing emails. </p>
	<p> You may connect one or more social networks with your Netflix account.  If you choose to do so, we will collect information from your social networking account(s) and your use of our social features.  For more information about our social features, see our <a href="https://www.netflix.com/socialterms&#10;">Social Terms</a>. </p>

	<h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
<p>
 </p> 
	<p> We may share your information within the <a href="http://support.netflix.com/en/node/6592">Netflix family of companies</a>.  The Netflix family of companies that access your information will follow practices that are consistent with the practices described in this Privacy Policy.  In addition we use other companies, agents or contractors to perform services on our behalf. For example, we have partnered with other companies, to provide infrastructure and IT services, personalize and optimize our web pages, process credit card transactions, provide customer service, collect debts, analyze and enhance data, including users' interaction with our website, and process consumer surveys. In the course of providing such services, these other companies may have access to your information.  We do not authorize these companies to use or disclose your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them. </p>

	<p> We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for participation, will require information be shared with third parties. For example, we may partner with companies that offer incentives, such as frequent flyer mileage awards, if you sign up or otherwise utilize our service. In fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share your name and other information in connection with fulfilling the incentive.  By participating in such joint promotions or programs, you consent to our sharing of your information.  Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third party businesses. </p>

	<p>Netflix also reserves the right to disclose personal information if we reasonably believe that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Netflix, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.  In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transferring of assets we reserve the right to transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our privacy policy. </p>

	<h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
	<p>To Enhance our Service</p>
	<p>As you interact with our service, we and our service providers may place cookies on your system.  Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your system for record keeping purposes.  In general, cookies can make the Internet more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular system. </p>

	<p>In addition to cookies, we and our service providers use  a variety of other technologies, including pixel tags (web beacons), clear gifs, or other technologies built into our application software or your Netflix ready device, to gather information on how users interact with our service. These cookies and other technologies can help personalize the service for you and help associate your interactions with our service to other information within your account.  They can show us, for example, popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information that can be used to improve, operate and monitor our website and other aspects of our service.   </p>
	<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If your browser is set to not accept any cookies, you will not be able to use the Netflix service or website. </p> 

<p>Ads Displayed on Third Party Sites</p>
<p> We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

	<h3>Security</h3>

	<p>Netflix takes information security very seriously and uses reasonable administrative, technical, physical and managerial measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access. For example, we utilize Secure Sockets Layering, an industry-standard protocol for certain of your transmissions to us, in order to encrypt certain personal information that you send to us through the registration and sign up process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. By using our service, including our website and user interfaces, or providing information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Netflix service. </p>

	<p>In order to provide you with ease of access to your account and to help administer the Netflix service, Netflix implements technology that enables us to recognize you as the account holder and provide you with direct access to your account without requiring you to retype any password or other user identification when you revisit the Netflix service.  You can choose not to take advantage of this feature on your computer by unchecking the box "Remember me on this computer" when you login on the website.  To remove access to your Netflix account from your devices: (a) go to the "Manage Netflix ready devices and computers" link on the "Your Account" page and deactivate devices that are linked to your Netflix account (note, deactivation may not occur immediately) or (b) delete your Netflix settings from your device (steps vary by device and the option is not available on all devices).  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account access information and for restricting access to your computer or device through which you access your Netflix account. If you disclose your password to anyone or share your account and/or devices with other people, you take full responsibility for their actions.  Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit.  If you sell or return a computer or Netflix ready device, you should log-out and deactivate the device before doing so.  If you fail to log out and deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your account information.  See above instructions on how to deactivate your device.</p>

	<h3>Transfer of Information and International Users</h3>

	<p>Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by using Netflix, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer of your information outside your country of residence to any country (including the United States) where we have facilities or engage third parties (including but not limited to payment processors, cloud service or other IT providers, and other companies that provide services to us).  You understand that the countries to which we may transfer information may not have as comprehensive a level of data protection as in your country. </p>
	<p>Personal information of individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area is controlled by Netflix Luxembourg S.à r.l, 26, Boulevard Royal, #205, L-2449 Luxembourg. </p>
