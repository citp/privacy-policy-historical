</p>
<p>
<b>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</b><br>
NetLine collects information from our users at several different points on our website, including:
</p>
<p>
Newsletters / Email Alerts<br>
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. NetLine uses the information provided to fulfill your request for information and, in some cases, personalize the email content for you. All emails that you have requested will have an option to unsubscribe, and unsubscribe requests will be processed within minutes.
</p>
<p>
	Information Requests<br>
Our site's information request forms require your name and email address as well as additional information to help us determine your needs related to our solution. We use this information to contact you about your request. Unless you have elected otherwise, the email address you provide on an information request form will not be added to our opt-in newsletter / emailing list.  
</p>
<p>
Surveys<br>
From time-to-time, our site may request information from you via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether or not to disclose the information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code, occupation).
</p>
<p>
	Special Offers<br>
To take advantage of promotional offers (e.g. free white paper) available on this site, you may be asked to complete a registration form requiring your name, email address, and other demographic information. Participation in these special offers is completely voluntary, however, you may not be able to take advantage of the offer without providing the required information. Unless you have elected otherwise, the email address you provide on a special offer registration form will not be added to our opt-in newsletter / emailing list.  
</p>
<p>

If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor.
</p>
<p>
<b>SECURITY</b><br>
NetLine has implemented generally accepted standards of technology security in order to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.

NetLine delivers permission-based electronic marketing campaigns, including newsletters, surveys, and product offerings on behalf of our clients. NetLine's role in supporting our clients may include hosting the actual collection site, delivery of email, tracking results of e-marketing campaigns, analysis of data, and transferring collected data back to the client.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, NetLine stores database lists from our clients. These lists may contain email addresses, street address, contact information and other relevant information. Confidentiality of the client list is a top priority. NetLine is contractually bound to keep our clients' customer data private. A client's list is never shared with other clients, partners, etc., and is treated as an asset of our client. 
</p>
<p>
NetLine tracks if a recipient has the ability to support HTML email in their email client, as well as whether an HTML email message has been opened or previewed. This capability is used only to deliver the best content to the recipient, and the recipient always has control to change their profile by contacting the client for whom the campaign was deployed. 
</p>
<p>
Information regarding the activity of campaign recipients is only reported to the client who deployed the e-marketing campaign through NetLine. Information about specific campaign recipients is only shared with the client who owns the list on which the recipients email address originally appeared. 
</p>
<p>
NetLine has a strict policy against sending unsolicited commercial email. If problems arise with a client's campaign, NetLine will work with the client to resolve the problems and prevent them in the future. If NetLine determines that a client has knowingly used our system for sending unsolicited commercial email, NetLine will revoke the right of this client to send email from our system.
</p>
<p>
If you no longer wish to receive email from a NetLine client, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the link within the email you receive or by contacting the client for whom the campaign was deployed directly.  If you experience difficulty opting out in either of these ways, email us at <a href="mailto:optout_help@netline.com" class="body">optout_help@netline.com</a>.
