# Privacy Policy | Nettuts+

### 1\. Our policy

  1. Hi, we’re Envato. Welcome to the privacy policy for our free Tuts+, Envato’s network of educational online and mobile sites. Your privacy is very important to us so we want to make it clear how we manage it.
  2. When we talk about Tuts+ we’re referring to our sites (including any apps). When we mention Envato it’s because that’s who we are and because we own and run the sites. If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘terms’ we’re talking about the rules for using the sites set out in our user agreement. Phew! Now that’s out of the way, let’s get on with the privacy information!
  3. This privacy policy explains how we use any information about you that you provide to us (which might identify you), or that we collect from you when you use the sites (which is unlikely to identify you). So please take the time to read the policy because you accept the terms of this policy when you use our sites and it is part of the Tuts+ user agreement.

### 2\. Personal information

  1. You don’t need to provide any personal information to us to use the Tuts+ sites.
  2. If you do voluntarily provide information to us when using Tuts+ you are consenting to the collection and use of your personal information by us. The ways you might give us personal information might include subscribing to hear from us, emailing us with a question or posting a comment on our sites.

### 3\. What you disclose to others

  2. We cannot control what others do with the personal information you’ve disclosed publicly on Tuts+.
  3. Of course, if you post comments using a user name alone, this might not be enough to allow others to identify you.
  4. If you share information via social media, including Twitter or Facebook, you will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites.



### 4\. Anonymous data

    * The number of times you access our site within any month;
    * The size of file you look at;
    * The website which referred you to Tuts+;
    * The operating system which your computer uses.
  2. We only use this information for statistical and website development purposes and to improve our services to you. It does not tell us who you are.



### 5\. Access to and/or changing your personal information

You may request access to your personal information and can ask us to correct your personal information [by contacting support](http://support.envato.com/).

Our sites have reasonable security measures in place to protect the loss or misuse of, or alteration or unauthorised access to, information under our control.

### 7\. When we have to update this policy

  1. Requirements around privacy are often changing and improving. As a result we’ll probably need to change this policy from time to time.
  2. When we do amend the policy the changes will be effective straightaway.
  3. We’ll publish about changes being made on [Envato Notes](http://notes.envato.com/) but it is your responsibility to check in and make sure you keep up to date.



### 8\. Special circumstances

Sometimes we might have an obligation to use or disclose your information in circumstance such as:

  * we tell you about the intended use or disclosure and you don’t object to that use or disclosure;
  * we believe that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary to assist a law enforcement agency or an agency responsible for governmental or public security in the performance of their functions;
  * when we are required by law to disclose the information.



### 9\. International transfer of information

  1. Our servers and information processing equipment are located in a number of countries around the world, so the information collected from you will be stored in those countries.
  2. By voluntarily providing information to us when using Tuts+, you are consenting to the collection and use of your personal information by us, including the transfer to another country other than Australia.
