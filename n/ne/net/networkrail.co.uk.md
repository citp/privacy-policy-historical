### Where we will transfer your personal information

To deliver services to you, it is sometimes necessary for us to share your personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA), eg:

  * With companies within the Network Rail Group with offices outside the EEA
  * With your and our service providers located outside the EEA
  * If you are based outside the EEA

In those circumstances, we undertake an assessment of the level of protection in light of the circumstances surrounding the transfer. We will make sure that any transfers are limited to the minimum amount of personal information possible and will always take steps to ensure that your personal information is adequately protected. In certain circumstances we may need to seek your consent unless there is an overriding legal need to transfer the personal information.

Our IT support is provided from across the world and when support is provided remotely, your personal information may be accessed from and therefore transferred to that country. If we transfer personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will implement appropriate and suitable safeguards to ensure that such data will be protected as required by applicable data protection law.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information we hold, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal personal information (and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means), and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

  * You have objected to the use of your personal information and we are verifying whether our grounds for the use of your personal information override your objection.



You have the right to obtain personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and for it to be transferred to you or another organisation, where it is technically feasible. The right only applies where the use of the personal information you provided was with your consent or for the performance of a contract with you, and when the use of your personal information is carried out by automated (ie, electronic) means.

You have the right to object to the use of your personal information in certain circumstances:

  * Where you have grounds relating to your particular situation and we use your personal information for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) or for our public functions, including for profiling.
  * If you object to the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.



You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time where we rely on your consent to use your personal information.

You have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner where you think we have not used your personal information in accordance with data protection law.

We aim to resolve any concerns you have and would ask that you contact us via our Data Protection Officer in the first instance. However if you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint to us, you can take a complaint to the [Information Commissioner's Office](http://www.ico.org.uk/)

#### No fee usually required

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

#### What we may need from you

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that your personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

#### Time limit to respond

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated of our timescales.
