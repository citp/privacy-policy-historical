        <h3>Networx Privacy Policy</h3>        
         This privacy policy applies to Networx.com. If users have questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please contact us first. <br>
<br>
<b>Registration and Service Professional Enrollment</b><br>
In order to participate in many of the site’s features, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site, to allow other members of the site to contact you, and/or inform you about service professionals you have been matched with. By providing this information to us, or by submitting a service request, you expressly consent to being contacted by us and by our service professionals and providers via phone, e-mail or other reasonable means, at any of your contact numbers or addresses, in order that we may provide the services set forth on our Web site, service your account, reasonably address matters pertaining to your account or for other reasonable purposes related to our business. <br>
<br>
<b>Service Request</b> <br>
We request information from the consumer in our service request interview process. A user must provide detailed information about the service requested. No financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date) is collected from the consumer. This information is used to match consumers with appropriate service professionals, so they can contact the user regarding his service request. The information may also be used to contact the consumer to verify or clarify their service request or for future communication related to home improvement services. <br>
<br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a piece of data tied to information about the user and stored on the user's computer. We use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until manually deleted. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf and to monitor certain pages of our Web site for the purpose of reporting web traffic, statistics, advertisement "click-throughs," and/or other activities on our site. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. <br>
<br>
<b>Third Party Advertising</b><br>
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our Web site (for example, advertisers). We have no access or control over these cookies once our business partners have been given permission to set cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Networx.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br>
<br>
<b>Log Files</b><br>
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Web site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
<b>Special Offers and Updates</b><br>
We send all new members a welcome email. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services and special deals related to roofing and home improvement. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option not to receive these types of communications on every e-mail sent by us to the user following the welcome e-mail (not including e-mails sent by the professionals, matched with the service request, which we don't have control of).<br>
<br>
<b>Leads Notifications and Trial Lead Notifications</b><br>
If a professional either signs up for our trial program or joins our service professional network, and elects to receive their leads via e-mail, that professional will receive multiple communications from us. <br>
<br>
<b>Customer Service</b><br>
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email, fax, phone or mail, and we reply to user inquiries via email or phone, or other reasonable means, in accordance with the user's wishes where applicable.<br>
<br>
<b>Sharing Information to Provide Services and to Conduct Our Business</b> <br>
When you submit information via networx.com, you authorize us to share this information with our network of service providers and partners in order to try to provide the services you request. For example, when an approved member of our service professional network accepts a lead from a registered user, and that user indicates the personal information he is willing to share so that the service professional can contact the user, such as telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, that information is shared with our service professionals who have accepted a service request lead. In addition, we have other approved contractual partners that fulfill services requests, or that utilize their own service professionals to supplement our network, and we share your information with them, subject to contractual confidentiality restrictions, in order to attempt to provide the services requested. Though we strive to preserve user privacy, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will always remain confidential. By way of example, we may disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a belief that such action is necessary or advisable to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, legal proceeding, process or investigation served on our business or Web site(s), or when we believe parties are misusing or attempting to misuse our Web sites or services, including but not limited to violating the law, committing fraud, deception, theft, attempting to harm or divert our business, engaging in threatening or inappropriate behavior or threatening to place, or placing themselves or others in danger. You should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the authority under certain circumstances to require us to share or transfer your information to third parties. Finally, although we strive to protect your privacy, third parties beyond our control may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.<br>
<br>
<b>Business Transitions</b><br>
In the event Networx.com goes through a business transition such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. <br>
<br>
<b>Links and Integrated Partnerships</b><br>
This Web site contains links from and to other Web sites. Please be aware that Networx.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other Web sites. We encourage our users to be aware of this when they leave our Web site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Networx.com web site. <br>
<br>
<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
From time-to-time we may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our services and this Web site. <br>
<br>
<b>Functionality of Web Site</b> <br>
We reserve the right to change our information, features, services, products, policies, promotions, disclosures and disclaimers at any time. Changes to this Policy will be in writing and be posted on our Web site as applicable. Please check these terms periodically for changes. <br>
<br>
<b>Contact Information</b><br>
If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at: privacy@networx.com.<br>
