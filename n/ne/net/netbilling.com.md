The gathering of information is always reasonable in relation to our business or the purpose for which the Website exists, and includes, without limitation, various information provided by you or your ISP to us.  We in turn, gather information from, and share information with necessary parties with whom or which we have an ongoing business relationship or may need to come into possession of user information in order to enable, facilitate, or otherwise enhance your experience with the Website. We take each user’s data privacy seriously, and at all times endeavor to collect, compile, handle, store, and disseminate user data (whether or not personally identifiable, “ **User Data** ”) in compliance with applicable law, including, as may be applicable to certain users, under the General Data Protection Regulation (the “ **GDPR** ”).This Privacy Policy sets forth the manner by which we undertake due care with respect to: (i) protecting User Data in accordance with applicable law and practices which we deem proper and commercially reasonably in relation to each form of User Data, (ii) protecting the rights of various parties handling, providing, and sharing or receiving User Data, such as users, our employees and contractors, and our business partners, (iii) our transparency with respect to the processing, handling, storage, and dissemination of User Data, (iv) our measures in respect to protection from data breach and other unauthorized disseminations of User Data, and (v) applicable law, including the GDPR generally, with respect to applicable users.

**"PERSONAL DATA" DEFINED**

"Personal Data" is defined in the GDPR as User Data which can be used to directly or indirectly identify the applicable user.  As used herein, Personal Data, includes, without limitation, information such as (i) contact data (such as your first and last name, user name or alias, physical street address, city, state, zip code, phone number and email address), (ii) financial data (such as your checking account number, credit card number, credit card expiration date, and credit card verification code), (iii) demographic data (such as your zip code and gender), and (iv) other legal data (such as your social security number and other sensitive information) or any number of attributes, which taken together may lead to the identity of you (such as physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social characteristics). Although an Internet Protocol (IP) address can only be used to determine the location of your device within a large radius (on the scale of miles or kilometers), Personal Data, for the purpose of the GDPR may include your IP address, and moreover, cookies in relation to your use of the Website.  Notwithstanding the fact that we may treat certain User Data as User Data which is not Personal Data, and cannot be used in order to identify a user (“Non-Identifiable Data”), to the extent that the GDPR applies to you, we will always treat information based upon the GDPR’s characterization of Personal Data.  For example, the IP or cookies of a user within the United States may be treated as Non-Identifiable Data, while the same attributed may be treated by the GDPR as Personal Data in certain instances.

**SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS UNDER THE GDPR**

The below table sets forth how we may process data received by a user entitled to the protections of the GDPR.

  **Requirements**

**Reason** | **Requirements**  
---|---  
**Contractual   necessity** | • Data processed must be necessary for the Website (or the purchase of products or services, as applicable) and defined in an agreement between a user and the Company  
**Consent** | 

• Requires a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent by clear affirmative action, including any consent  provided in this Privacy Policy

• Users have a right to withdraw consent, which must be brought to their attention

• Must be from a user over the age of consent in the applicable jurisdiction, otherwise given by or authorized by a parent / guardian

• Explicit consent is required for some processing (e.g., special categories of Personal Data)  
  
**Legitimate interests** | 

• If a business or a third party has legitimate interests which are not overridden by a user’s rights or interests.

• Processing must be paused if an individual objects to it  
  
“Data controller” and “data processor” are important concepts in understanding a company's responsibilities under the GDPR. Depending on the scenario, a company may be a data controller, data processor or both, and will have specific responsibilities as a result:  A company is a data controller when it has the responsibility of deciding why and how (the “purposes” and “means”) the Personal Data is processed.

Under the GDPR, data controllers must adopt compliance measures to cover how data is collected, what it's used for and how long it's retained.  They will also need to make sure people can access the data about them.  Data controllers must ensure data processors meet their contractual commitments to process data safely and legally.  This Privacy Policy sets forth and discussed all matters in relation to our activities, if any, as a data controller.

A company is a data processor when it processes Personal Data on behalf of a data controller. Under the GDPR, data processors have obligations to process data safely and legally.  This Privacy Policy sets forth and discussed all matters in relation to our activities, if any, as a data processor.

Any transfer of Personal Data outside of the EEA (European Economic Area) must meet certain legal requirements. To the extent we are in receipt of Personal Data being transferred from inside the EEA to any region outside the EEA, we will at all times comply with applicable restrictions.

To the extent that we operate as a data controller and/or processor, our workplace will at all times be cognizant of applicable restrictions, and comply therewith.
