# Privacy Policy - Company | Micro Focus

### 1\. Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how Micro Focus International plc and its group companies including Attachmate®, Borland®, NetIQ, Novell® and SUSE® ("Micro Focus") use your personal information. Your right to privacy is very important to Micro Focus. At Micro Focus, we believe that the personal information you provide to us must be kept confidential and used in a responsible fashion. We consistently strive to put our best efforts towards achieving both of these objectives. 

#### What information do we collect?

  * information about your computer, such as which browser you are using, your network location, the type of connection you are using (e.g. broadband, ADSL etc) and your IP address.



We do this by using cookies (although the information we gather through our cookies is protected and remains anonymous so we cannot tell who you are). See our Cookie Policy below.

Once you register for membership, log in, or submit information through our Website we will know who you are and your activities on this Website and information about you and/or your company may be recorded on our systems. For example, we may ask for the following information when you sign up for membership of our specialist software support services or email news services, or when you buy products from us or register your products online:

  * postal address; 
  * job function;
  * country where you are based or purchasing/registering our products from;

We may also collect personal information from you at trade shows/events, from telephone calls, surveys and/or other correspondence with you. 

If you make a purchase from us we may also ask for payment information such as the details of the payment card you are using to pay for any products/services. 

#### What do we do with the information we collect?

We use this information for a variety of reasons. The main reason we use this information is to provide you with the Website and our products and services (whether available via the Website or offline). We also use the information for: 

  * internal record keeping; 
  * product and service development; 
  * developing our Website; 
  * answering your queries or complaints; 
  * delivery of products or services and/or order fulfillment including through our resellers, distributors and other agents;
  * market research; and 
  * marketing our own products and services (including special offers and upgrades) to you. 



#### Marketing

We may send you information about Micro Focus' products and services or related data by post or email or telephone, unless you have asked us not to do so. 

If you are a customer of ours or you have previously asked us for information on our products and services, such as subscribing to our email news service, then we may send you information by email. However, in every marketing email message we send you we will give you the opportunity to unsubscribe from our mailings altogether. 

We do not provide your personal information to external organisations (i.e. outside of Micro Focus) for their own marketing purposes without your explicit consent. 

If at any time you do not want your information used for direct marketing purposes please contact us at [compliance@microfocus.com](mailto:compliance@microfocus.com) and if you decide that you no longer wish to receive marketing emails from us, please follow the unsubscribe link in one of our marketing email messages. 

However, please note that we may send out periodic emails, including to inform you of a technical service or security issues relating to a product or service you have requested or purchased, or confirming your request or purchase of a product or service. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe from these communications, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen. 

You can also easily manage and update your membership information at any time by logging onto your Micro Focus profile on our Website, including controlling whether you wish to receive marketing emails from us.

#### Who do we share this information with? 

Your personal information may be shared across the Micro Focus Group of companies. For example, your personal information may be processed by the relevant Micro Focus group company situated in the country in which you are accessing our Website from and the country in which you are purchasing our products/services, if different. Please bear in mind that the countries to which your personal information is sent/accessed from may have a different standard of data protection than the country in which you are situated. However, we have put in place protections to ensure that your information is safeguarded. To find out more information about the companies within the Micro Focus Group that may handle your personal information please visit [www.microfocus.com](http://www.microfocus.com/).

We may share your personal information with organisations acting on our behalf and with our manufacturers, agents, distributors or resellers, but they will only use the information to provide our products or services. However, any third party that we may share your information with must act in accordance with our instructions. We may also share your personal information with a purchaser or potential purchaser of our business. 

In some circumstances, we may have to disclose your personal information to comply with the law/other regulatory purposes, or because we are required to do so by a court, the police, or other regulatory body. 

#### How to get copies of or amend the information we have collected

You may request details of the personal information that we hold about you under data protection laws. If you would like a copy of the information held about you please write to us at [compliance@microfocus.com](mailto:compliance@microfocus.com). 

If you think any information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, please email us as soon as possible. We will correct or update any information as soon as we can.

#### Security

Micro Focus takes security of your personal data seriously and in order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online, including policies on access to information and firewalls. However, despite the measures we take, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information from third party 'hackers' illegally obtaining this information.

If at any point you suspect or become aware of a security incident (i.e. your password is stolen or you receive a suspicious communication from someone holding themselves out to be a Micro Focus employee or from a dupe website claiming to be affiliated with Micro Focus), please forward the communication to us or report the incident by email to [compliance@microfocus.com](mailto:compliance@microfocus.com) or in writing to Group Compliance Officer, Micro Focus, The Lawn, 22-30 Old Bath Road, Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 1QN, United Kingdom as soon as possible.

#### Linking to other websites

Our Website or marketing email messages sometimes include links to other websites which are not within our control. Once you have left our Website/marketing email message, we cannot be held responsible for the content of other websites or the protection and privacy of any information which you provide to those websites. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question. 

#### Safe Harbor Framework

Micro Focus complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

#### Our Use of Cookies

Like many companies, some or all of our Websites may use "cookies". A Cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that is placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. We may use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. For more information on cookies, please see [www.whatarecookies.com](http://www.whatarecookies.com/).

Most of the cookies we use are "personalisation cookies" which are used to recognise repeat visitors to the Websites and "analytics cookies" which monitor how visitors use our Websites and give us a better understanding of what content visitors are spending most time reading. The types of cookies used on our Websites are as follows:

Analytics / Performance | These cookies are used only to help us to improve our Websites over time, by giving us insights into how the various sections of the Websites are used and how users interact with the Websites, for example which pages visitors go to most often and whether they get error messages from web pages. The information collected is anonymous and statistical.  
Authentication / Functionality | These cookies are used to identify unique visitors to the Websites. If you log in to the Websites, these are the cookies that allow us to remember who you are and what your preferences are so that we can provide you with access to pages personal to you, for example your account pages or your selected font size.
