# Network for Good :: Help

Network for Good and all of our partners value and respect all individuals and organizations seeking to donate time, money, or resources to groups in need. We understand that you may be concerned about privacy issues that surround the use of the Internet. 

We believe that you should have control over who receives your personal information, whether it concerns where you live, what your interests are, or how you choose to conduct transactions. We're focused on only one thing: helping you help others in a safe and secure environment. 

Therefore, we do not disclose, share, sell, or trade information about your individual visits to Network for Good or the information that you may give us such as your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number, to any outside companies except for the use of completing a donation transaction that you initiate or a request to volunteer with a nonprofit organization. We will release personal information about you, if necessary, in order to comply with valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order. 

Other Web sites that you may link to from our site, including our partners' Web sites, have their own privacy policies. Network for Good is not responsible for the privacy practices of other Web sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of Web sites before providing them with any of your personal information. 

## How Network for Good Uses Information About You

When you make donations or select a volunteer opportunity, we may specifically ask for information about you -- such as name, home or Internet address, and billing information -- in order to provide that service or information to you. This information will be used solely for the purposes of completing your donation or locating the volunteer opportunity you are seeking. 

Your personal information will be shared with the organization to whom you are donating unless you choose not to make it available to them. When you make an online donation, you will have the opportunity to keep your personal information private by electing to make your donation anonymously. If you do elect to provide your name and information to the charity, that organization will likely retain your name and may use it for future solicitations. They may also provide it to other organizations for their use. If you do not want to be contacted again by that charity or want to make sure that the organization you have given money to does not share your name, you will need to let them know directly. For more information on making an online donation, visit our Help area. 

The information which Network for Good automatically gathers, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its areas, is used only in the aggregate -- very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. This collective data helps us determine how much our visitors use parts of the site, so that we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. We also may provide aggregated statistical "ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our Network for Good partners about how our visitors, collectively, use Network for Good. We do this so they too can understand how often people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible experience. 

## Network for Good Security

Network for Good takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and offline. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry. Network for Good uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to keep your personal information as secure as possible. Network for Good helps to protect your information by working with partners that provide a secure and safe environment for credit card donations. 

## Your Volunteer Record of Service

We have asked you to create your Volunteer Record of Service using your e-mail address because it is a unique identifier (no one else has your e-mail address) and because it will be easiest for you to remember. Your e-mail address will not be shared with any third parties and will not be used for any other purpose by Network for Good, unless you indicate that you would like to receive periodic e-mail updates. If you checked the box beside "Send me updates," you will receive periodic e-mail updates.

We realize the data that you enter into your Volunteer Record of Service is information of a personal nature. This data will be treated accordingly with every precaution related to security and privacy as described above. Information concerning specific organizations and your individual volunteer activity on their behalf will not be shared with any other organization, nor will your personal comments and reflections.

Our system automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on our site. We do not use any of this navigational data about where you -- as an individual -- go on the site. Nor do we share any of this data with outside companies. We do use navigational information in the aggregate to understand how our members as a group use the service so that we can improve the site.

If you are a parent and would like your child to create a Volunteer Record of Service, we encourage you to participate in this activity with your child.

If we change our privacy statement, we will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
