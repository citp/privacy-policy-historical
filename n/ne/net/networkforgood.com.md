Complying With the Legal System

Though Network for Good makes every effort to preserve donor and customer privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our organization.

Complying with Donor Advised Fund Regulations

Your contribution is made to Network for Good, a section 501(c)(3) nonprofit, donor advised fund, which will distribute your donation to the nonprofit organization that you recommended.  As required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Network for Good has exclusive legal control over the donations to our donor-advised fund.  All donations are final and may not be refunded.  In the rare event that a charity you have recommended does not satisfy Network for Good's criteria for receiving donations (i.e., it has been classified by the IRS as a disqualified supporting organization, it cannot or does not accept donations, is not recognized by the IRS as a section 501(c)(3) public charity, or is not in good standing with federal and state regulators), Network for Good will select an alternate charity to receive your donation funds.  
 

Changes to the Policy

Network for Good periodically reviews and updates this privacy policy.  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to our web site so our donors and customers are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
