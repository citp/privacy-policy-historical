# Privacy Policy - Netweather

#### Who We Are

**MBC Netweather Ltd** (Netweather) gather and process your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and in compliance with the relevant data protection Regulation and laws. This notice provides you with the necessary information regarding your rights and our obligations, and explains how, why and when we process your personal data.

Our registered office is at 3rd Floor, 86-90 Paul Street, London, EC2A 4NE and we are a company registered in England and Wales under company number 07063403.

**Our services:** When we refer to our services, they are a combination of our website (Netweather.tv), our apps, our API and data-feeds and any other related products that we offer.

#### Information That We Collect

Netweather processes your personal information to meet our legal, statutory and contractual obligations and to provide you with our products and services. We will never collect any unnecessary personal data from you and do not process your information in any way, other than as specified in this notice.

#### Cookies (and other browser or device based storage)

We set and use (first party) cookies on Netweather for a number of purposes - these ensure a good experience and have functions which include keeping you logged in to any parts of the site you may be registered for (such as the forum or Netweather Extra), storing settings and forecast locations for your use as you move around the site or for return visits, and for us to analyse anonymised usage statistics and data for the usage of our website and apps.

Our first party cookies contain no personal information, and are set solely to be used on Netweather. You can control how websites use cookies through your browser settings, but please be aware that parts of Netweather may not function correctly should you choose to block all cookies set by the site.

Our service partners, such as Cloudflare and Google Cloud also set cookies to provide functionality and security for our services - these don't contain personal information.

Our advertising partners may also store and process 3rd party cookies, these are primarily used to provide relevant advertising to you, but are only used if you have given consent. 

#### Web server logs

Similar to the vast majority of websites, our servers also make logs of the usage of our website and services (such as our apps and data feed API’s). These log files include information such as IP address, browser and device type, pages visited and the urls of referring pages.

We store these logs securely and use them to track any errors, for security auditing, and to identify or investigate any potentially malicious use of our services. We regularly ‘rotate’ these logs and they are usually not kept for longer than 30 days. We won’t share log files with any third parties, unless required to by law, or if they’re required to establish or exercise our legal rights (eg to defend against legal claims). We may also anonymise them (by removing any IP addresses) and share them with our service providers should they be required for troubleshooting or investigation.

#### Registering for parts of our website or communicating with us

When registering on some of our services or communicating with us via our website or apps (for example registering for our community forums, MessageCentre, Netweather Extra, entering any competitions or promotions we run, or contacting our support desk), we may ask for, and should you choose to share it with us, collect relevant personal information from you.

  * Payment details (although we do not store any payment information, we simply pass those details securely to our payment provider, Stripe)
