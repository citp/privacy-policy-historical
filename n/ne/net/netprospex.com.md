From time to time we may also share this Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) in aggregate and de-identified form only, with third parties. This information reveals nothing about individual users and visitors to the website and is only used to communicate demographic and behavioral understandings of our customers and visitors internally and to potential advertisers, business partners and investors.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information Collected from the NetProspex Business Contact Database

If your business data appears in the NetProspex Business Contact Database (as described below), NetProspex may share such information with a third party provider for the purpose of extracting certain Non-PII information, such as demographic, behavioral and technical information from such data to aggregate and create segments of anonymous data, which are also called “cookies,” that can be used for targeted business ads and for marketing purposes. Such extracted, anonymous, and aggregated Non-PII information may be shared with third party partners such as ad networks, data management platforms, and others to help them present, better target and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and online marketing efforts. Specifically, NetProspex partners with Liveramp for the purposes of providing certain of our third party partners with non-PII data cookies from our NetProspex Business Contact Database which can be used for the purpose of online advertising and marketing.
