---  
Network54.com is a free Internet service owned and operated by the Network54 Corporation of the city of Los Angeles, California. The following statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our Internet services.   
**About Network54.com**  
Network54.com is a free public hosting service for online forums, chatrooms, groupware and other Internet services. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.   
**Session and Login Information**  
We record your IP address, unique cookie, and login if you are currently logged in, with every message that you post to the Network54.com server. We also use a random cookie to associate your browser session with your Network54 login when you log into your account so that you (and only you) have access to your Network54 resources. Additionally, cookies are used on a per session basis to automatically fill out message posting forms so that you don't have to type information into these forms repeatedly. The IP, login, and cookies are also used to count unique visitors to a forum or other resources when reading any web page, and are used in some cases to show recent visitors that visited a web page. This same information may now or in the future be saved in a log for the benefit of the webmaster (forum owner) or Network54 or the public. IP addresses are easily linked to countries, states, cities, ISPs, and source companies and these pieces of information can and will be availble to the public, the forum owner only, and Network54 and can and will be used for the purpose of reporting and access control. If users or a resource (such as a forum or chatroom) break our terms of service, we may, at our option and at any time show such IP addresses, service providers, and geographic location information of users visiting or posting at this site. 

We allow users to optionally provide contact and/or demographic information when they create a Network54 login. Your email address (if you provide one to us) is used if we ever need to contact you regarding your Network54 login and any forums, chatrooms, or other resources that you create on our site. The email address that you provide to us is not sold or distributed to any third party. Any demographic information provided to Network54.com is disclosed on an aggregate basis to our advertisers and is not provided on an individual basis to any organization or entity.

Network54.com may contain links to and/or images and pictures from other sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any sites linked to by the Network54.com server. We use an outside advertising company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information.   
**Security**  
Network54.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. This includes actively monitoring our servers and networks for activities intended to disrupt provision of our services.   
**Parental Consent and Use of Network54.com by Minors**  
Minors may optionally provide contact information without prior parental consent or parental notification. This site also gives minors the ability to publicly post or distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent.
