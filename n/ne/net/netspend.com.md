### How We Use Your Personal Information and Payment Information

Personal Information provided through a Netspend card application is used solely to evaluate your application and is subject to this Netspend Online Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the bank issuing the card for which you have applied.

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the Personal Information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. SSL encryption also is used on our Site when you are asked to enter confidential information as part of your application. You can tell you have entered an encrypted session in several ways. Whenever you see an unbroken key or a locked padlock icon on the bottom of your browser screen, you have entered an encrypted session. In addition, when your session changes from “http” to “https,” you are in an encrypted session.
