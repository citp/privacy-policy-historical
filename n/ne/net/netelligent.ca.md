### 3\. How and why we collect Personal Information?

We collect most of our information about you directly from you, with your consent for the purposes outlined below. We may also obtain Personal Information about you from third parties, with your consent. For example, for credit evaluation purposes, we may need to determine your creditworthiness through contact with an independent credit-reporting agency.

We will not collect or use Personal Information for any other or new purpose without obtaining consent, unless required or authorized by law.

We generally collect Personal Information for the following purposes:

Contact information: We collect Personal Information to establish, develop and preserve our business relationships with customers and other individuals with whom we deal with. We will usually collect your name, address, phone number(s) and email address, as well as other account and payment information, including information pertaining to your use of our products and services when you register for our services in order to create, establish and administer your account, to provide services, and to respond to inquiries. We will also use Personal Information to establish or verify the eligibility and credit of persons that use, or intend to use, one or more of the products or services we offer.

Security and accuracy: We use Personal Information to authenticate the identity of our customers, for the administration of access to our facilities, for the security and protection of our operations, to preserve the privacy of our customers contacting us by telephone, electronic means or otherwise and to ensure our records are accurate in order to protect our customers and eStruxture from error and fraud.

Management and quality: We collect Personal Information for internal training and quality assurance purposes, for audit purposes and to manage our businesses and ensure the efficiency, reliability and security of our systems and networks.

Customer Service: From time to time we may also use Personal Information to conduct surveys on the quality of our products, services or customer service, to provide our customers with offers for additional products and services that we feel may be of interest to our customers or to provide personalized products and services as well as product recommendations and to understand and assess the interests, wants and changing needs of customers with a view to improving our products and services and developing new ones.

Human Resources: If you have applied for employment with eStruxture, the Personal Information submitted with your job application will be used for recruitment and other customary human resources purposes. For example, we may send you information about new job opportunities within eStruxture as well as other career development resources.

We do not sell or rent our customers’ Personal Information to any other party. However, we may share some of your Personal Information in the normal course of business within our corporate family or we may transfer your Personal Information to third party service providers who assist us in serving you, such as vendors, suppliers and agents. Our service providers may be located outside of Canada and may be required to disclose Personal Information under the laws of their jurisdiction.

Where information is sent to a third party for processing, we try to ensure that such service providers may only use the information for the limited purposes for which it was disclosed and are required to keep the information secure. Moreover, we operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.
