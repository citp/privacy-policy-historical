Whether it’s auto, home, renter’s, life, health or business insurance, NetQuote offers you the complete choice advantage.

Since 1989, NetQuote has provided millions of consumers with a free, simple, and effective way to shop for insurance. As a leading online marketplace for insurance, NetQuote works with a combination of local agents, regional and national carriers to ensure that you are provided with a wide variety of responses to your request for a quote.

Helping you save money is important but so is your privacy.  This policy outlines our commitment to protecting your information.

Your Privacy is Important to Us

At NetQuote, your privacy is our chief concern. We understand that you entrust us with your private information to help us match you with an insurance agent (we refer to all of these as "Agents") who can meet your needs. In exchange for your trust, you expect and deserve our commitment to treat your information with respect.  Rest assured that we protect your privacy. Under no circumstances will NetQuote sell or share any personal information about you to or with any person or organization except: as authorized by you, to participating agents or other parties involved in your transaction, or as may be required by law or court order. The Privacy Policy below describes the standards we adhere to in handling information about you and your insurance quote request.

1\.  Who We Are and What We Do

NetQuote is the leading online marketplace connecting consumers with insurance agents to compete for their business across a variety of insurance policy types.  NetQuote has been in business since 1989.  NetQuote is not an insurance agency and does not provide quotes directly to consumers.  Rather, NetQuote is a free matching service that instantly connects you with our nationwide network of quality insurance agents. 

After you submit your quote request via our web site, NetQuote immediately matches you to local and national agents who can meet your insurance needs.  We create this connection by emailing you the list of matching agents and their contact information as well as passing your information to the agents.  Your matching agents will use the information you provided in your quote request to run your quote and contact you with the details.  Sometimes, NetQuote does not have a matching agent based on your location and insurance needs.  In this event, your information may be passed to one of our partner copmanies to ensure that you receive as many competitive quotes as possible. 

NetQuote does not charge a fee to use our service.  NetQuote is paid a fee by the insurance agents who purchase leads through our service. 

2\.  Information Collected

**Personal Information**

NetQuote collects the following personal information in each of our quote requests.  We pass this information on to your matching agents so they can generate accurate quotes for you.

**Technical information**

We collect and track certain technical information to ensure that your consumer experience is a beneficial one.  We may also use technical information to store your preferences and make future visits to our site quicker for you. 

  * Cookies – a cookie is a small file stored on a user’s computer that contains information about the user.  We use either session ID cookies (which terminate once a browser is closed) or persistent cookies (which are small text files stored on a user’s hard drive for an extended period of time).  Cookies allow us to see how and when you use our sites, but they cannot be used to track personal information such as email address or phone number.  Cookies also allow us to store the personal preferences that you set during each visit to our sites which can speed up your future visits.
  

  * Log files – NetQuote uses log files to track how our sites are being accesses and used.  Log files track anonymous user information such as IP addresses, browser types, Internet service providers, referring and exit pages, platform type, date and time stamps, and number of clicks to, from, and within our sites.  Web logs are tracked only on NetQuote’s servers and do not place anything on your computer.
  

  * Information from Banner Ads – if you arrive at NetQuote.com through a banner ad, NetQuote can track where you arrived from, as well as clicks that might have impacted our servers.  This information is anonymous and cannot be used to gather personal information about you.
  

**Survey information**

NetQuote uses survey information to gather feedback from consumers who have filled out insurance quote requests on our web site.  We use this information to track our customer satisfaction and make improvements to our service. This survey, which will arrive approximately one week after a quote request has been filled out, is completely voluntary and anonymous.  No personal information will be asked of you.

**Information from the "Contact Us" section of the web site**

If you decide to communicate with us through the “Contact Us” section on our web site, we may ask you for personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number.   This information is not sold to any third parties.  Your information may, however, be shared with outside sources in order to resolve any problems you may have.

**Information gathered from agents**

Our agent web site contains preliminary information for insurance agents who might like to join our network.  If you are an agent and submit information through the “Request More Information” page, your email address and phone number will be used for contact purposes but not shared with any outside parties.

**Information gathered from affiliates**

The affiliate section of our web site contains preliminary information for people who might like to join our affiliate network.  If you sign up as an affiliate we will gather personal information such as name, postal address, and phone number.  This information is used to contact you with information such as payment delivery notifications and a monthly affiliate newsletter.  This information is never shared with any outside parties.

3\.  How Your Information is Used

**How we share information with agents**

When you submit a quote request with NetQuote, your information is used to match you with an average of three to four qualified, licensed agents who can best serve your insurance needs.  In the event that we cannot match you with an agent, your information may be passed on to one of our partner companies in an effort to ensure you receive as many competitive quotes as possible.

**How we internally use technical information to improve marketing**

NetQuote uses technical information such as cookies and web logs to study how our sites are being used.  We can also use cookies to track your preferences so that when you return to our web site, you can navigate more easily without having to re-enter certain information.  By analyzing the data that cookies and web logs provide, we can determine how to improve our web sites and banner ad campaigns to better serve our customers.

**How we use survey data to measure satisfaction**

NetQuote uses information from our consumer satisfaction survey to better understand the consumer experience and improve our services.  Personal information is not visible to anyone as this survey is completely anonymous.

**Other uses of your information by third parties**

  * Partner companies – in the event that no NetQuote agents can serve your insurance needs, the information from your quote request may be passed to one of our partner companies.  We feel it would be poor customer service to fail to provide a quote merely because no matching agents are available.  In these circumstances, we pass your quote request only to partner companies that we have an existing contractual relationship.  NetQuote only enters into relationships with reputable companies and our contract requires they follow applicable laws and not misuse the data provided to them.  Any contact from partner companies is not covered under this policy, nor are any further communications you may have with agents from those partner companies.
  

  * Companies that perform information processing on our behalf – NetQuote partners with companies who manage our email systems and conduct surveys on our behalf.  Your personal information is shared with these companies on a limited basis so that we can create and target our marketing campaigns.
  

  * Law Enforcement – NetQuote will share your personal information in response to law enforcement officers, government personnel, court order or subpoena.  This information will only be shared in order to comply with a legal obligation.
  



4\. Communications You Can Expect

**Confirmation email**

Minutes after you submit a quote request through NetQuote, you will receive a confirmation email.  This email will include your unique quote request ID, a link to your list of matching agents and helpful information to aid you in making your insurance choices.  Note that the agents contained in your matching list will be those responding to you with your customized quote(s).

In the event that a match cannot be made, you will receive an email informing you that no agents meet your quote request requirements.  This email will be sent within a matter of hours after you complete a quote request. 

**Follow up calls and emails from agents**

After submitting a quote request through NetQuote, your quote request is matched with qualified, licensed agents.  These agents may contact you via the information that you provided in your quote request.

**Customer satisfaction surveys**

Approximately one week after you submit a quote request through NetQuote, you will receive an anonymous customer service satisfaction survey.  This survey is short and completely voluntary.  Also, we may, from time-to-time, send additional surveys to better understand your customer experience so we can enhance our service.  Again, participation is voluntary and you can unsubscribe from this communication at any time.

**Customer Communications**

After submitting a quote request with NetQuote, you’ll receive monthly customer tip emails with helpful tips and information to help you continue to make informed insurance decisions.  In addition, NetQuote provides expiration alert emails that notify consumers about their policy renewal dates.  If you wish to no longer receive these communications, you can opt-out using the unsubscribe link available in every email communication.  This will ensure you will be removed from future NetQuote communications.

**Newsletter**

You have the opportunity to sign up for NetQuote’s monthly newsletter on the last page of each quote request, within the newsletter center within NetQuote.com, or on the designated areas located throughout the site.  After signing up to receive this newsletter, you will receive a welcome email to confirm your subscription and provide you an opportunity to unsubscribe for any reason.  You will receive the NetQuote e-newsletter once a month to your email inbox.  You can opt out of this newsletter at any time by clicking the Unsubscribe link in the email.

5\.  Altering or Deleting the Information You Submit Through the NetQuote Web Site

**Email preferences**

NetQuote email communications consist of our customer satisfaction surveys, our e-newsletter, customer tips, and expiration notices.  If you do not wish to receive these communications, please take one of the following actions: 

  * Click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email communication. (This is the fastest and most effective way to unsubscribe.)

In certain situations, our system will be unable to process your unsubscribe request. The most likely reason for this is that you are subscribed with a different email address. At the bottom of the original email you received, you will see a line that says "you are subscribed as." This is the email address we have on file for you.

In order to find your exact record and unsubscribe you, please send an e-mail to [nqtalks@netquote.com](mailto:nqtalks@netquote.com) that contains the "subscribed as" email address. This will ensure your prompt removal from our mailing lists. 

  * Send an email to [nqtalks@netquote.com](mailto:nqtalks@netquote.com) with the subject line “Unsubscribe.” ****
  * Submit a written request for removal to our mailing address:

 **NetQuote** , Inc.  
Attn:  Email Marketing Department  
1860 Blake Street, Suite 900   
Denver, Colorado 80202


**Agent communications**

By submitting a quote request with NetQuote, insurance agents will contact you using the phone number and email address provided.  In order stop these communications, you must contact the agents directly and request that they stop contacting you. ****

If you decide to purchase insurance from one of the insurance agents matched to you through NetQuote, all further contact with that agent is not covered under this policy.   You should thoroughly read the Privacy Policy of the agent you select in order to make sure that you are comfortable with their policy. 

**Quote requests**

NetQuote is not an insurance agency.  We are a free matching service that instantly connects you with our nationwide network of quality insurance agents.  After you submit your quote request via our web site, NetQuote immediately matches you to local agents and sends your information to them.  This process happens instantly; therefore, there is not an opportunity for you to edit your original information after it’s been submitted.  We recommend that you communicate the needed changes directly to the agents with whom you were matched.  You can find your agent(s) contact information in the email we sent you to confirm your quote request.  This will ensure your updates are made and that the agent uses the most accurate information available to process your quote.

**System records**

All personal information provided to NetQuote in a quote request will be removed from our production database after 60 days.
