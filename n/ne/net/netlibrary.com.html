					<b>IP Address</b><br>
					The netLibrary Web site logs IP addresses for system administration purposes.
					Your IP address can help us diagnose problems with our server and track a user’s
					session to give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting.  In addition,
					we track system information, such as the type of browser you are using, your operating
					system, and the referring IP address.  We use this information in aggregate only; we
					do not link IP addresses to any personal identifiers.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Cookies</b><br>
					netLibrary uses a feature of your browser called a cookie to store your member ID and
					state information about where you are in the site.  netLibrary uses cookies to keep
					track of where you are in the site since the Internet is a stateless environment, but
					many of netLibrary's functions, such as moving from one page to the next in a book,
					require state.  netLibrary does not store any of your personal information in cookies.
					A cookie is simply a small data file that the Web site writes to your hard drive.
					A cookie can’t read any other data off your hard drive, pass on a virus, or read
					cookie files created by other sites.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. netLibrary will not
					operate properly without cookies enabled.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Registration</b><br>
					A significant amount of the site is available without registration, but in order
					to take advantage of some features of netLibrary, you must register and create a
					member account. The netLibrary online registration form requires you to provide your
					full name, e-mail address, ZIP code, a User Name, and password.  All other registration
					information, such as your age, address, phone number, and employer, is optional and is
					marked as such. We hope that, like many netLibrary users, you will want to provide
					information about yourself so that we can continue to make our Web site more valuable
					to you.
				</p>
				<p>
					For certain contests, surveys, or chat forums, we may ask you to provide additional
					information about yourself.  Participation in these enhanced services is completely
					optional.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you choose to purchase additional products or services from netLibrary, we
					will collect your billing address, credit card number, and credit card expiration
					date.  Occasionally, our publishers request that we provide the name of all eBook
					purchasers along with the items purchased.  The purchase of eBooks may imply consent
					to providing that information.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Recommend to a Friend</b><br>
					If a user elects to use our "Recommend to a friend" service for 
					informing a friend about eBooks offered by netLibrary, we ask them 
					for both their email address the friend's email address. netLibrary 
					will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to 
					visit the site but does not store these email addresses for 
					future use.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Links</b><br>
					This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that 
					netLibrary is not responsible for the privacy practices of such 
					other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our 
					site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site 
					that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy 
					statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Usage</b><br>
					As you interact with netLibrary, your usage patterns are logged anonymously.
					This tells us if you searched to find information and what searches
					you used.  We also log whether or not your searches were successful and what subject
					areas you visited.  The logs use your session ID only, they do not connect with your
					specific member ID.  Usage data is viewed and analyzed in aggregated form only.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Circulation Records</b><br>
					While you are viewing an eBook in netLibrary, or while you have an eBook checked
					out, the system has to be able to recognize you to know if you have access rights
					to that eBook.  However, we do not keep any long-term circulation records.  It is
					not possible to view a history of what publications an individual has used.  We do
					keep track of any eBooks that you personally may purchase so that the system can
					recognize you as the owner and person authorized to access them.
