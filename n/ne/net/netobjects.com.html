NetObjects provides a link to NetObjects's privacy notice on its sites, and in e-mails.<br>&nbsp;<br><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">CHOICE</span></b><br>NetObjects offers customers and individuals who provide us information choices about receiving further communications from us; for example, our e-mail newsletters have a link to use to opt out of receiving future messages. NetObjects may ask individuals if they wish to participate in market research, and then contact them if they give us their permission. NetObjects does not contact customers or individuals for marketing purposes for those persons who have contacted NetObjects directly to opt out of our direct marketing programs.<br>&nbsp;<br><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">TECHNOLOGY</span></b><br>NetObjects uses technology in order to better serve its customers and others. NetObjects informs customers or individuals when NetObjects use technologies that are privacy related. <br>&nbsp;<br><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">DATA INTEGRITY &amp; ACCESS</span></b><br>NetObjects takes steps to make sure that the personal information NetObjects uses is correct.

Data may be temporarily transferred to a vendor or business partner to provide services for NetObjects, such as mailing information or processing credit card transactions. These vendors and business partners are required to protect and manage the personal information to the same high standards NetObjects uses, and they cannot use the information for purposes other than to provide the services NetObjects has requested.
