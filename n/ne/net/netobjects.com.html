    <p>This information is collected on Web pages using encryption technology to help prevent any third party from intercepting the information. Your credit card information is only used for completing the transaction and is retained only as necessary for administration purposes. NetObjects uses the information provided by our customers to analyze product trends based on, for example, geographic and demographic factors. This analysis helps us improve the quality of our Web site and product and service mix.</p>
    <h4><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Information Collected in Contests</span></b></h4>
    <p>If you enter one of our contests, the data we collect will be handled according to the rules of that particular contest and those rules may differ based on where you live. We provide a privacy policy specific to each contest that you should review prior to entering the contest.</p>
    <h4><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Downloading Software</span></b></h4>
    <p>When you download a NetObjects product, NetObjects asks you to provide your e-mail address in order to guide you through the 30-day trial period of using the software. We do not verify the validity of the e-mail address. You may unsubscribe from the follow up e-mails by contacting our webmaster at any time.</p>
    <h4><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTICE</span></b></h4>
    <p>NetObjects informs its customers what information it collects, how it is used, whether it may be temporarily transferred to others to provide the products or services requested and how to contact NetObjects with privacy inquiries. NetObjects provides a link to NetObjects's privacy notice on its sites, and in e-mails.</p>
    <h4><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">CHOICE</span></b></h4>
    <p>NetObjects offers customers and individuals who provide us information choices about receiving further communications from us; for example, our e-mail newsletters have a link to use to opt out of receiving future messages. NetObjects may ask individuals if they wish to participate in market research, and then contact them if they give us their permission. NetObjects does not contact customers or individuals for marketing purposes for those persons who have contacted NetObjects directly to opt out of our direct marketing programs.</p>
    <h4><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">TECHNOLOGY</span></b></h4>
    <p>NetObjects uses technology in order to better serve its customers and others. NetObjects informs customers or individuals when NetObjects use technologies that are privacy related.</p>
    <h4><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">DATA INTEGRITY &amp; ACCESS</span></b></h4>
    <p>NetObjects takes steps to make sure that the personal information NetObjects uses is correct. NetObjects provides customers and individuals with reasonable access to the personal information they may have provided us so that they can review and correct it, or ask us not to use it.

    <h4><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">SECURITY</span></b></h4>
    <p>NetObjects protects personal information under its control by industry standard security practices and measures, in order to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. NetObjects limits access to personal information to those who have a business need. NetObjects does not keep personal information any longer than necessary to meet the business purpose for which it was collected, though in some cases, legal or regulatory reasons require that personal information not be deleted. NetObjects shall use its best efforts to quickly work to remedy any vulnerabilities found in our or software and to alert our customers about any potentially dangerous vulnerabilities.</p>
    <h4><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">DATA TRANSFER</span></b></h4>
    <p>NetObjects may transfer personal information to NetObjects databases in countries other than where it was provided. NetObjects' privacy program requires the same high level of security and protection of personal information in all geographies with procedures and contracts in place to help ensure this is so. Data may be temporarily transferred to a vendor or business partner to provide services for NetObjects, such as mailing information or processing credit card transactions. These vendors and business partners are required to protect and manage the personal information to the same high standards NetObjects uses, and they cannot use the information for purposes other than to provide the services NetObjects has requested. Also, NetObjects may disclose or transfer your personal information, including, without limitation, personal information regarding customers under 13, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) satisfy an applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable NetObjects' Terms of Use, License or Service Agreements; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (d) to protect against imminent harm to rights, property or safety of NetObjects, its users, or the public at large as required or permitted by law.</p>
