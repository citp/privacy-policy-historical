	<h1><font size="4" color="#003300">PRIVACY POLICY</font><br>Your Privacy Matters to NetMechanic!</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
		


&nbsp;<p align="justify">NetMechanic, Inc. which recently became a wholly owned 
	subsidiary of Keynote Systems, Inc. believes that strong electronic privacy 
	is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet as a service and 
	commercial medium. Please be assured that Keynote, its subsidiaries, and 
	NetMechanic are committed to safeguarding customer privacy on its websites 
	and we know you will feel confident that your identifiable information will 
	be protected when you access our website or order services from us over the 
	Internet. You may find Keynote Systems, Inc's privacy policy at <a href="http://www.keynote.com/legal/privacy_tpl.html" class="mapLink">
	http://www.keynote.com/legal/privacy_tpl.html</a>.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>     




<p align="justify">NetMechanic, Inc. has created this privacy statement to 
demonstrate our commitment to privacy and to outline how we plan to handle such 
information. The following describes our information gathering and usage 
practices for <a href="http://www.netmechanic.com" class="mapLink">
www.netmechanic.com</a>.     





</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p><font color="blue"><b>1. Information 
	NetMechanic gathers and how it is used</b></font></p>



<p align="justify">NetMechanic collects data from your IP address to help 
diagnose problems with our server and to analyze paths through our Web site. 
Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information about our 
audience which we use to improve the NetMechanic Service (for example, how many 
international users do we have, how many users use version 3.0 of Netscape, 
etc).&nbsp; </p>



<p align="justify">NetMechanic issues cookies to users when they come to our Web 
site to allow us to learn how many unique visitors we have, to aid in analyzing 
navigation paths through our site, to grant discounts to visitors who elect to 
take part special promotions, and to maintain login information during a 
subscriber's session.&nbsp; Cookie tracking identifies you by using a unique 
number; personal information such as name and address are only correlated with 
cookie information to allow us to manage subscriber login sessions.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify">Other companies which place advertising on our site also have 
the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that NetMechanic does 
not control. However, cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only 
machines, so these advertisers will not know who you are - and NetMechanic will 
not tell them. </p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify"><font color="blue"><b>a.&nbsp; Subscription Users </b></font>
- NetMechanic's registration form requires users requesting a product or service 
to give us contact information (such as name, email address, postal address and 
other data). We use this information to process the order, to infrequently email 
information on the company (such as a promotional mailing on a new service), and 
to contact the visitor when necessary. We also collect visitor's financial 
information (such as a purchase order number or credit card numbers) to bill the 
user for products and services and for processing credit cards. </p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify">Users may easily opt-out of receiving future mailings by 
opting out of the newsletter (leaving the checkbox unchecked) or by requesting 
removal from the newsletter or promotions using any of the methods listed below 
in the <a href="#Section3" class="mapLink">Choice/Opt-Out section</a>.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify"><font color="blue"><b>b.&nbsp; Free Users </b></font>
- - When using our free tools, we have a form for the user to enter their URL 
and email address. The URL is always required because our tool needs that 
information to know for which site to run a job. The email address is optional 
for the HTML Toolbox and GIFBot tools. Due to the nature of our other tools an 
email address is required (for example, with our server monitoring service the 
email address is needed so we have a way to contact a user about a server 
problem). Personal data is never released to any third party. </p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>     



<p align="justify"><font color="blue"><b>c.&nbsp; All Users </b></font>

- Whether you are a free user or subscription user, you can be assured that if 
you provide information to NetMechanic, no individual data will passed on to any 
third-party. NetMechanic will divulge information only as necessary to comply 
with state and federal laws.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify">On occasion, NetMechanic conducts online surveys that ask 
visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic 
information (like their zip code, age, or income level). These surveys are 
conducted to determine better ways to support our customers. Survey results 
provide us information that enables us to better tailor our content to readers' 
needs and to help our advertisers better understand the aggregate demographics 
of our audience. No individual personal data will ever be released from these 
surveys. Data may be used in aggregate form to learn more about our customers' 
needs.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify">NetMechanic may present information to advertisers in the 
form of aggregate statistics compiled among all of our visitors' answers to 
survey questions as well as grouped on-site behavior. This is to help our 
advertisers tailor the content of ads to the interests of our customers. At no 
time is individual data shared with anyone.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify">NetMechanic also provides a free email newsletter that covers 
subjects related to building and maintaining Web sites. Subscription to our 
newsletter is optional and requires you to reply to a confirmation email 
indicating your desire to subscribe. Users may opt-in for the newsletter by 
clicking on the checkbox on the "subscribe to newsletter" option. Users can 
decline this service by leaving the checkbox unchecked or by choosing not to 
reply to the confirmation message. If users decide to unsubscribe, it is an easy 
one step process described in the <a href="#Section3" class="mapLink">
Choice/Opt-Out section</a> below.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify">In addition, NetMechanic provides a Free Monthly Tune Up 
option that provides users with an automatic free test of their site. 
Subscription to the Free Monthly Tune Up is optional and requires you to reply 
to a confirmation email indicating your desire to receive this service. Users 
may opt-in for their Free Monthly Tune Up by clicking on the checkbox on the 
"Free Monthly Tune Up" option. Users can decline this service by leaving the 
checkbox unchecked or by choosing not to reply to the confirmation message. If 
users decide to unsubscribe, it is an easy one step process described in the <a href="#Section3">
Choice/Opt-Out section</a> below.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify">NetMechanic may occasionally sponsor a Sweepstakes or 
contest. In these cases, NetMechanic will require users name, mailing address, 
and email address. Should you choose to participate, we will notify you via 
email of the result. Should you be a winner and prize redemption instructions 
will be sent via postal mail to the address you gave us with your entry form. We 
will not use your personal information for any other purpose and you will not 
receive any additional mailings.</p>



<p align="justify">NetMechanic occasionally sends informational or promotional 
mailings related to our services to free users and subscribers. These mailings 
provide information about our services, and may offer subscription discounts. If 
a user does not wish to receive this type of information, they may elect to 
remove their address as described in the <a href="#Section3" class="mapLink">
Choice/Opt-Out section</a> below. </p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify">NetMechanic may offer interactive polls to users so they can 
easily share their opinions with other users and see what the audience thinks 
about important issues. NetMechanic uses a system to "tag" users after they have 
voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not 
correlated with information about individual users.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p> 



<p align="justify">As a subsidiary of Keynote, NetMechanic may also share [your 
identifiable information] with Keynote and other Keynote subsidiaries to offer 
you products and services that may be of interest to you. Again, you may elect 
not to have such information shared for these purposes as described in the <a href="#Section3" class="mapLink">
Choice/Opt-Out section</a>
below. (Please note that if you have previously responded to an inquiry or 
notice from NetMechanic regarding this sharing, that the preference expressed by 
your response will be honored and you do not need to separately Out-Out as 
described below.)</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify">The NetMechanic Web site contains links to other sites. 
NetMechanic is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such 
Web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked 
sites, as their Privacy Policy may differ from ours.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>              



<p align="justify">Although we do have business partners and co branded sites, 
at no time do we share individual data collected with them.  </p>





<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><font color="blue"><b>2. Security</b></font></p>



<p align="justify">This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, 
misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Access to computer 
data and files at NetMechanic, Inc. are secured by password coding to prevent 
unauthorized access.</p>



<p align="justify">NetMechanic utilizes industry standard SSL encryption when 
accepting your credit card information during our online checkout process. SSL 
encryption is a method by which information transmitted across the Internet is 
encoded to defeat theft by anyone who should intercept the data before it 
reaches its destination. All reputable online stores make use of SSL encryption 
to request credit card information and other sensitive data from their 
customers. Web pages where SSL encryption is activated are typically identified 
by a lock or key symbol displayed somewhere in your browser.
</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>



<p align="justify">Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed 
and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the 
information provided by our customers.</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
