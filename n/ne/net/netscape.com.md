Thank you for visiting Netscape. Netscape is committed to honoring the privacy of our members and visitors, and is a certified member of the TRUSTe program. This privacy policy, part of our overall [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20050310094747id_/http://channels.netscape.com/ns/info/tos.jsp) covers personally identifiable information shared through Netscape's Service.

When you register for Netscape and other Netscape services, we ask you for your name, contact information, preferences, and certain demographic information. This information lets us provide personalized services and communicate separately with you. We also use aggregated information about the use of our services to evaluate our users' preferences, improve our programming, and facilitate third-party reporting of internet usage. 

Like most websites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us 'remember' information about your preferences and passwords and allow you to move within our Service without reintroducing yourself. Recent versions of Netscape's browsers let you easily see and control cookies. Netscape and its advertisers may also use cookies to determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements users have seen and how users responded to them, but don?t use such cookies to collect personally identifiable information unless you give us permission to do so. Similarly, Netscape and its advertisers may use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous advertising metrics and to deliver cookies related to such advertisements. 

While we need certain information to register you as a unique user and let you access personalized services, such as MyNetscape and Netscape WebMail, other requested information is optional and may be given at your discretion. We occasionally send out an email newsletter to Netscape members to highlight features of the Service. You can elect not to receive communications from us or from other parties, either when you register or by noting your preference in response to communications from us. We encourage Netscape members to update and edit their personal information and keep it current. You can easily correct or update your personal information at any time via our [Member Center](https://myaccount.netscape.com/marketing.psp) or other location specifically identified in connection with a particular part of our Service. We store all user information in secure databases protected via a variety of access controls. This data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement. We do not share personally identifiable data with other companies (apart from those acting as our agents in providing our Service to you, who agree to use it only for that purpose), except as necessary to fulfill a transaction you have requested, or unless you otherwise give us permission to do so. Netscape may also share such information in response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena. You may separately agree to provide your information to other companies who provide content for various parts of our Service, in order to use their services, order their products, or receive offers from them. If you agree to provide information to these companies, that information will be subject to their privacy policies. If you have registered with the Netscape Network, please review the [Netscape Network's Privacy Policy](http://about.netscape.com/networkprivacy/index.html), which explains the information practices that apply to you when you use the Netscape Network.Children may not register for Netscape or use any Netscape services that require personally identifiable information. For questions about kids' privacy or other issues at Netscape, please email [Policy2004@netscape.net](mailto:policy2004@netscape.net).Please contact us directly at [Policy2004@netscape.net](mailto:policy2004@netscape.net) with any questions or comments. If we have not satisfactorily responded within five business days, please contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php). TRUSTe, an independent, nonprofit initiative, seeks to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting fair information practices. When you visit a web site displaying the TRUSTe mark, you can expect to be told what personally identifiable information is collected, how it is used, and with whom it will be shared. To demonstrate our commitment to respecting your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have TRUSTe review them for compliance with our policies. For general information regarding privacy you can visit [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.netscape.com), [BBB Online](http://www.bbbonline.org/), or the [Federal Trade Commission](http://www.ftc.gov/).
