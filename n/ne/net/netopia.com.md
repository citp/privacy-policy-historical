### Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is important to Netopia. We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the Netopia Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we collect and use your personal information. 

We are committed to protecting your personal privacy. Our core principles relating to privacy demonstrate that commitment: 

  1. We do not give out your telephone number, credit card information or screen names. 
  2. We may use information about the kinds of products you buy to make other marketing offers to you, unless you tell us not to. We do not give out your individual purchase information to any third party. 
  3. We restrict employee access to customer information in order to safeguard your personal information. 
  4. We do not knowingly solicit personal information from children, send them requests for personal information, or distribute their personal information to third parties without parental consent. 

**Our companywide commitment to privacy**  
To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate this privacy policy to every Netopia employee. 

**Why we collect personal information**  
Netopia collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and other information we think you'd like to hear about. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products. 

(Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, and other information when needed to provide a service or product that you requested.) 

What information does Netopia receive and how does Netopia use it?  
In general, you can visit www.netopia.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We track the products people buy and the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us to learn how our customers as a group purchase our products and use our Web site. We use this information in the aggregate so that we can improve the products and services Netopia provides you. We may also share this statistical information with our partners and other outside companies, but in doing so, we don't disclose individual names or personal navigational information. 

**How we collect personal information**  
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, or participate in an online survey. In addition, when you register a new Netopia product, sign up for Netopia on-line services such as Netopia Parental Controls, or ask to be included in an email mailing list, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database. 

We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing information. In some cases, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in". In this circumstance, we will require you affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for any purpose other that the specific purpose for which it was submitted. 

**When we disclose personal information**  
Netopia works with other companies that help us provide Netopia products and services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver your products efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies safeguard your personal information in accordance with Netopia policies. 

Your personal information is never shared outside Netopia without your permission, except under conditions described in this policy. At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest or to protect personal safety. 

**How we protect your personal information**  
We store all customer information in secure databases protected via a variety of access controls. The data is accessed only for the purposes stated in this privacy statement. 

Netopia safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our Web Site including the Netopia store, Netopia uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. 

**Collecting other personal information**  
When you browse Netopia Web site, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, we don't collect personal information when you browse -- not even your email address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using. 

Like many Web sites, the Netopia Web site uses "cookie" technology. When you first connect to our site, the cookie identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you, except perhaps your first name so we can welcome you on your next visit. Cookies help us understand which parts of our web sites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better. 

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our Web site, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of Netopia's web site if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our web site. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many parts of our web site. 

In some of our emails, we may use a "click-through URL." When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the web site that is your destination. We track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. 

**Children and privacy**  
Netopia's web sites do not target and are not intended to attract children under the age of 13. Netopia does not knowingly solicit personal information from children, send them requests for personal information, or distribute their personal information to third parties without parental consent. 

**Third party sites**  
Netopia's web sites may contain links to other sites. Netopia does not share your personal information with those web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies. 

Our web site may contain links to web sites operated by other companies. Some of these third-party sites may be co-branded with a Netopia logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Netopia. Although we choose our business partners carefully, Netopia is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site. Once you have left our web site, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party web site to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you. 

**Changes to this privacy policy**  
If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner. 

The Netopia Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. If we make any changes in the way we use your personal information, we will make that information available by posting a notice on our web site. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes. 

**Questions or Suggestions**  
Personal data privacy is a new and evolving area, and Netopia is evolving to meet these demands. Mistakes are possible, and miscommunication is possible. 

If you have any comments or questions regarding our privacy policy or about our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information, please send an email to [privacy@netopia.com](mailto:privacy@netopia.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Question). You also may send a letter to Privacy, Legal Department, Netopia, 6001 Shellmound Street, 4th Floor, Emeryville, CA 94608. We will respond to your inquiries in a prompt and professional manner.
