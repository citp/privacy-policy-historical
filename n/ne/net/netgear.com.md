We collect this information directly from you. For example, we ask you to provide your contact details in order to register an account with us (for example, on MyNETGEAR or Meural), to subscribe to marketing communications from us, apply for a giveaway or promotion or become a beta tester, and/or to submit inquiries to us.

In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this type of information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.
    * In addition, we may also collect information (such as business contact details) from our stores, resellers or distribution partners, or from people you may know and refer you for jobs and other marketing materials. Please note that in these instances, we check with the third parties to ensure they have obtained your prior consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us.

#### **14\. How We Protect Your Personal Information**

We intend to protect the Personal Information entrusted to us and treat it securely in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Information in our possession. We also contractually require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Sites or Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and not sharing it with anyone. We also encourage you to use caution when using the Internet as it is not 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted electronically and we cannot promise that your use of our Sites and Services will be completely safe. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are also not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Sites.

If you participate in a discussion forum, local communities, or chat room on a NETGEAR website, you should be aware that the information you provide there (i.e. your public profile) will be made broadly available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither NETGEAR nor you have control over. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. NETGEAR is not responsible for the Personal Information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

#### **15\. Retention of Personal Information**

We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it or when you request its deletion, unless we are allowed or required by law to keep the information for a longer period. We completed periodic reviews of our databases, and have established time limits for certain data deletion, taking into account the type of services provided in the context of the Products and Services, the length of our relationship with you, mandatory retention periods, and the statute of limitations.

#### **16\. Third Party Services**

Our Services may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third parties. If you click on a link to a third party site, you will be taken to a website(s) we do not control. These links are provided for your information and convenience only and are not an endorsement of the content of such linked websites or third parties. Any information you provide on third-party sites or services may be provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through us. This Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of that website. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of such website carefully. We are not responsible for third party sites or services to which links or access are provided through our Services, nor are we responsible for their content or availability.

#### **17\. Updates to this Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we modify our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised version here, with an updated revision date. We recommend that you visit these pages periodically to be aware of and review any such revisions. If we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we may also notify you by other means prior to the changes taking effect, such as by posting a notice on our Sites or sending you a notification.
