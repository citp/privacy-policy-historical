Net Detective adds to its online database (which is available to all members) information concerning and limited to member’ names, address, email, and phone numbers obtained through the registration process. If for any reason, a member does not wish to have said information included within the database they may contact us as set forth below in CHOICE AND OPT OUT.

Third Party Links: We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by our Site.

Advertisements: We may from time to time use various outside ad-serving companies to serve advertisements on our Site. In the process of serving advertisements, the ad serving companies may place a cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this Site and other websites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. By delivering ads on our site, the ad-server is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what pages the user was viewing when the ads were delivered. This web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information the ad-server has collected from your visits to our Site and other sites not affiliated with Net Detective. This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad-serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see online at our Site and other sites not affiliated with Net Detective.

Surveys or Promotions: From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes or other promotions on our Site, which might be sponsored or conducted by a third party. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these promotions is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information. If there is a third party sponsor involved please make sure to review that party’s privacy policy. 

**USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We do not sell or market, knowingly solicit information from, or sell Net Detective to anyone who is under 18.

Examples might include sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links, and merchant processing functions. They may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

Third Party Offers: We share personally identifiable information with third parties in order to have them send you special offers and promotions that we think you might find of interest to you. We will also occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, or promotions, which we have found that may be of interest to you.

For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the delivery of a service is delayed we might send you an email, or if there is some service issue with something you might have ordered. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. 

Exceptional Circumstances: If the HD Publishing Group or any of its lines of businesses or affiliated companies, is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, the relevant databases of Net Detective could, in whole or in part, be sold as part of that transaction. Therefore, information about the users of our Site, including personal information, will be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the Site, our services or sale or pledge of our company assets as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.

We also may have to release personally identifying information when it is necessary to comply with judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, orders, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Net Detective’s users or others.
