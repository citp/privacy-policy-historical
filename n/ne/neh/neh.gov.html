			  <p><b>Privacy Statement</b></p>
			  <p>Maintaining the privacy of our users is important to 
              us and our privacy policy is clear. We will collect <b>no personal

			  <a href="" name="PersonalInformation"></a>
			  <p><b>Personal Information</b></p>
			  
			  <p>If you provide us with information about yourself via e-mail or our

			  at the point of collection, such as to send you information or to respond 
			  to your questions or comments.  If you provide contact information, NEH 
			  staff or our contractors or partners may contact you to clarify your comment

			  <p>We do not sell any personal information to third parties.  We never collect

			  will be outside the agency; we will take appropriate security measures with the 
			  information that we share with them. The information otherwise would be disclosed 
			  only for a governmental purpose or as required by law.</p>
			  
			  <p>We also may share information you give us with another government agency if your 
			  inquiry relates to that agency.  In other limited circumstances, such as responses to 
			  requests from Congress and private individuals, we may be required by law to disclose 
			  information you submit.</p>

				<p>We use third-party Web sites and applications to publicize agency events, increase awareness of NEH programs, and interact with those interested in the agency work.

				<p>We reserve the right to review links and add or remove links at any time for any reason 
				consistent with Federal policy or NEH guidance.  Links to external Web sites may be removed 
				if the Web sites lobby or solicit the Federal government on positions of fiscal or political 
				nature, or if they receive funds or revenue for volume of traffic delivered from NEH to the 
				external site where the site is not an official partner of NEH.  Except for partnerships, NEH
