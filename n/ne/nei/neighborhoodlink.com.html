If you have questions regarding this privacy statement, please direct them to the Neighborhood Link staff (<a href="mailto:privacy@neighborhoodlink.com">privacy@neighborhoodlink.com</a>). 
<br>
<br>
Neighborhood Link has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Neighborhood Link Web site.
<br>
<br>
<b>Personal Information</b><br>
<br>
It is Neighborhood Link's intention to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit the Neighborhood Link Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. However, there are places on our Web site when we may need information from you, such as your name, email address, city/state, and zip code. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you. 
<br>
<br>
Neighborhood Link will not distribute or sell any of your personal information to third parties.  However, your name and email address are available to registered coordinators.  These coordinators have agreed to keep this information confidential.  We do release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Neighborhood Link, our users, or others.<br>
<br>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. We also can use the IP address to verify the identity of perpetrators of illegal postings. 
<br>
<br>
We do keep track of the domains from which people visit us. Your domain address is used to gather broad demographic data. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it.
<br>
<br>
The Neighborhood Link Web site's registration forms (only found in certain areas of our site) require users to give us contact information (like their name and email address). We use the contact information from registration forms to send information about Neighborhood Link and to insure that our programming is used for legitimate purposes (see our Terms of Use). The contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Visitors may opt-out of receiving future communications (see below).
<br>
<br>
<b>Public Forums</b><br>
The Neighborhood Link Web site makes chat rooms, forums, and message boards available to its visitors. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, please exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.  Neighborhood Link may post the transcript of a chat session on a Web site or other media for informational, example, or demonstration purposes.
<br>
<br>
<b>Security</b><br>
The Neighborhood Link Web site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We back up the entire Neighborhood Link Web site on a daily basis, and have password protected access levels which insure legitimate site administration.
<br>
<br>
<b>Business relationships</b><br>
The Neighborhood Link Web site contains links to other Web sites.
Neighborhood Link is not responsible for the security practices of the
Web sites that are linked from our site. We highly recommend that
visitors check the privacy statements at these linked sites.
<br>
<br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>

A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Some Neighborhood Link pages use cookies so that we can better serve you when you visit and then return to our site. We use cookies to deliver information specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit certain areas of our Web site. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
If we make any material changes to our privacy practices or if we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated in our privacy policy at the time of collection, we will notify you via email regardless of your privacy settings.  We will also post a revised privacy page 30 days prior to any change.<br>
