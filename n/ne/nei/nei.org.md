# Nuclear Energy Institute - Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to information collected from users of NEI websites (“you” or “users”). NEI currently collects three types of information from online users: (1) your computer’s IP (Internet Protocol) address; (2) personal information you voluntarily submit on publication order forms, meeting registration forms, newsletter or update service subscription forms, e-mails sent to NEI via the website, or member registration forms and other information submitted for access to the Members Only section of our Web site; and (3) cookies if you use them.

  **IP addresses** : An IP address is a numerical designation that identifies your computer or network link to the Internet. Your IP address may be assigned to the computer which you are using to access the Internet, or to your Internet Service Provider’s server. An IP address is machine-specific, not person-specific, and thus does not by itself personally identify the user. NEI collects and uses its users’ IP addresses to help us diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site quality. We do not use IP addresses to personally identify users. We review a log file of IP addresses to determine which areas of our site visitors access and to revise our site content based on the interests of users. We do not track the usage patterns of individual users, except when they click through from e-mails that we send out.

  **Personal Information** : Personal information you voluntarily disclose to NEI either online or in writing through publication order forms, meeting registration forms, survey response forms, service enrollment or registration forms, and e-mail sent to NEI through the website is added to the relevant NEI database to enable processing of the order or registration, to update our member, user and customer databases, and/or to enable us to make an appropriate response. This information is usually the name, email and/or physical address, item or service purchased or requested, meeting attended, or topic of interest. NEI may send emails or other communications to individuals based on the information voluntarily submitted to NEI. On occasion, we also contract with third parties for co-marketing or other activities related to the NEI’s goals and objectives, and allow them to use selected member or user information under strict confidentiality agreements. NEI does not rent or sell email addresses submitted to us. NEI will not otherwise disclose its member or customer information to the government or other third parties unless required by law.

  Information provided to NEI in non-electronic form may also be used in this way. Individuals who would like to “opt out” of receiving additional communications from NEI should contact us to have their names removed from our lists. Corrections or other changes may also be made by e-mailing membership@nei.org or by calling (202) 739-8000.

  NEI endeavors to take appropriate measures to assure the reliability of member records and to protect them from loss, misuse or alteration. Member records are protected from access by Internet users through the use of firewalls and other security capabilities. 

**Cookies** : We also may use cookies to enhance your experience with our website. "Cookies" are small files downloaded to your hard drive that enable your browser to save and recall information about your use of the NEI website, such as the web pages you visited, the date when you last looked at a specific web page, and specific preferences you record. We may use this data to tailor our users' experiences, to show them content that we think they might be interested in, and to display the content according to their preferences. We may share demographic information with third parties on an aggregate basis. Although you can prevent websites from placing cookies on your computer by using your browser's preference menu, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use all features of our website. 

**Public Forums** : NEI may make chat rooms, forums, or message boards available to its online users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in that context. 

**Amendments** : NEI reserves the right to change its Privacy Policy at any time, by posting amended terms on this website. Use of the website after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the amended policy.  We reserve the right to apply the amended terms to the information we have already collected, subject to any legal constraints. You should read and review this page regularly to see if there have been any changes. 

**Successors and Legal Obligations** : NEI reserves the right to provide any successor in interest with our member and user database, and other information collected pursuant to this privacy policy. We also reserve the right to comply with court orders or other legal obligations. 

**Effective Date** : The effective date of this privacy policy is July 15, 2007.
