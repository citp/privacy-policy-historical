## How Nelio May Collect Personal Data

Nelio and Nelio’s third party service providers may collect both personal data and other data from a variety of sources that generally fall into three categories:

  * **Direct interactions** : From your use of and interaction with us through the Channels and other activities such as account creation, submission of registrations and forms, or sales inquiries and transactions.
  * **Publicly available data / data from third parties** : Data from automated interactions on non-Nelio websites, or other data you may have made publicly available, such as social media posts, or data provided by third party sources, such as marketing opt-in lists, or data aggregators.
  * **Automated interactions** : From the use of technologies such as electronic communication protocols, cookies, embedded URLs or pixels, widgets, buttons and tools (for more details, see below).



Although Nelio’s use of automated interactions may change over time as technology evolves, the following descriptions are designed to provide you with additional detail about Nelio’s current approach to information collected from automated interactions. Nelio may automatically receive information from you as part of the communication connection itself, which often consists of network routing information (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), your IP address (which may identify your general geographic location or company), and date and time.

Nelio may also automatically receive and record information about your interaction with the Channels, such as clickstream information (when each Nelio webpage was visited and how much time was spent on the page), or general geo-location data.

## Cookies

### Concept, use and types

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile device browser from a website’s server and is stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website or third party service provider used by said website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website or third party service provider to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites or other third party service providers. A cookie will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what’s in your shopping basket.

Cookies are used to record information about your online preferences and allow third parties to tailor the websites to your interests. Information supplied by cookies can help third parties to analyse your use of the relevant sites and help the third party to provide you with a better user experience. For example, you may choose to personalise the content of a website to see it in a certain language. In order to do this, a cookie is placed on your device to remember this preference.

Nelio can use the following type of cookies:

**Essential cookies** are necessary to provide you with services and features available through Nelio’s Channels. Without these cookies, services you may need, such as registration to Nelio’s services cannot be provided.

**Analytics or customization cookies** collect information that is either used in an aggregate form to help us understand how the Channels are being used or how effective Nelio’s marketing campaigns are, or to help Nelio to customize the Channels for you.

### Nelio’s cookies

Nelio has defined and owns certain cookies that are used to run A/B tests and heatmaps experiments and to track visitor information. See [Cookies Stored by Nelio A/B Testing](http://support.nelioabtesting.com/solution/articles/1000165881-cookies-stored-by-nelio-a-b-testing) for further details.

### Social Media Features and Widgets

Our Channels may include social media features (such as Facebook’s “Like” button), widgets (such as the “Share This” button) or interactive mini-programs that run on Nelio’s site. These features are usually recognizable by their third party brand or logo and may collect your IP address, the page you are visiting on Nelio’s site, and set a cookie to enable the feature to properly work. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or directly hosted on Nelio’s site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

### Refusing cookies

Your browser may provide you with information and control over cookies. You can set your browser to alert you when a cookie is being used, and accept or reject the cookie. You can also set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. Users can generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion. Cookies, however, are important to the proper functioning of a site, and disabling them may degrade your experience and interfere with website features and customizations.
