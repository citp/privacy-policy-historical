### Scope And Application Of The Nelson Privacy Code:

The scope and application of the Nelson Privacy Code are as follows: 

The Nelson Privacy Code applies to Personal Information about Nelson Employees and non-employee Persons who interact with Nelson that is collected, used or disclosed by Nelson.

  * Employees in this context includes past and present employees and independent contractors of Nelson.
  * Non-employee Persons in this context includes Individuals who are viewers, readers, subscribers, advertisers, contest participants, job applicants, Internet users who are exposed to the media content of Nelson or a Nelson Company and about whom Nelson collects Personal Information.



The Nelson Privacy Code applies to the management of Personal Information in any form whether oral, electronic or written. Nelson reserves the right to amend this Nelson Privacy Code from time to time.

The application of the Nelson Privacy Code is subject to the requirements or provisions of any applicable legislation, regulations or agreements (such as collective agreements), or the order of any court or other lawful authority.

_**Exclusions from privacy protection:**_ The Nelson Privacy Code does not impose any limits on the collection, use or disclosure of the following information by a Nelson Company: a) information that is publicly available, such as a Person’s name, address, telephone number and electronic address, when listed in a directory or made available through directory assistance; b) business-contact information, such as the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization; c) information collected, used or disclosed in the course of journalistic, literary or artistic activities; or d) aggregate information that cannot be associated with a specific person, such as demographic statistics about Nelson customers, or number of visitors and average time spent on a website.

### Purposes for Collection of Personal Information:

Nelson has collected and collects Personal Information for the following purposes: a) to establish and maintain responsible commercial relations with Individuals and to provide ongoing service; b) to understand Individual needs; c) to develop, enhance, market or provide products and services; d) to manage and develop its business and operations, including personnel and employment matters; and e) to meet legal or regulatory requirements, including to protect or defend a legal interest, and in connection with an actual or possible Nelson corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation with another entity, or an actual or possible sale of all or a substantial portion of the assets of Nelson, provided that the Personal Information disclosed continues to be used by the entity acquiring the information either for evaluation of the possible transaction, or, on completion of any such transaction, for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy.

As examples of the above:

> i) Nelson may from time to time use a Person’s Personal Information to contact the Person about changes, enhancements or similar notices related to Nelson Companies products and services;

### Obtaining Consent:

Nelson will make a reasonable effort to make sure Persons understand how their Personal Information will be used by Nelson. Nelson will obtain consent from Persons before or when it collects or uses the Personal Information. Nelson will not attempt to deceive Persons into giving consent. 

A Person’s consent can be express, implied, or given through an authorized representative. A Person can withdraw consent at any time, with certain exceptions noted herein. Nelson, however, may collect, use or disclose Personal Information without the Person’s knowledge or consent in exceptional circumstances where such collection, use or disclosure is permitted or as required by law. 

> Note: If any Person at any time has any questions or concerns about Nelson’s privacy practices, the Person can either:  
>  i) write to Customer Service – Privacy, Nelson Thomson Learning, 1120 Birchmount Road, Toronto, ON, M1K 5G4; or  
>  ii) provide information to Nelson through the form on its Internet Privacy page.

###  Refusing or withdrawing Consent:

Subject to legal and contractual requirements, a Person can refuse to consent to Nelson’s collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information about the Person, or a Person may withdraw the Person’s consent to Nelson’s further collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information at any time in the future by giving Nelson reasonable notice, unless: i) the consent relates to certain information required for credit approval which a Person applies for or accepts, ii) the consent is otherwise required by law or iii) the use or disclosure is permitted by law or is related to the legal or regulatory requirements described herein. If a Person refuses or withdraws the Person’s consent, Nelson may not be able to provide the Person or continue to provide the Person with some products, services or information which may be of value to the Person.

###  Internet Aspects:

Personal Information may be collected when a user conducts activities on or related to all websites of Nelson Companies (“Nelson Companies Sites”) or related to services made available on the Nelson Companies Sites (“Nelson Companies Services”). Although information collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below often does not constitute Personal Information (and to the extent that such is the case, then the obligations under the Nelson Privacy Code do not extend to such information), Nelson provides the details below about Internet aspects of Nelson Companies Services for the purposes of disclosure about Nelson Companies Services.

_Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)_  
When the user’s web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This address is called the computer's "IP address." For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user logs on.

Nelson Companies may use the user’s IP Address to:

  * facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the user’s or Nelson Company’s technical team.
  * display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and advertising based on the user’s geographic area.
  * estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.



_Cookies_  
A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to the user’s web browser from a web site's computers and is stored on the user’s computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to a user’s computer.

Nelson Companies may use cookies to:

  * improve the operation and performance of the Nelson Companies Services and to make Nelson Companies Services easier and more convenient to use. For example, cookies help Nelson Companies provide more personalized services by recalling user preferences on subsequent visits (e.g. language preference). Cookies also allow Nelson Companies to save passwords and preferences for a user so that the user will not have to re-enter them on the next visit to a Nelson Companies Site;
  * measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to Nelson Companies Services and advertisements (e.g. number of users, average time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information helps Nelson Companies to better understand when to update, change or offer new services and provides Nelson Companies with details as to the performance of Third Party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to Nelson Companies’ current and prospective sponsors, advertisers and business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in such reports;
  * display advertisements. Nelson Companies and Third Party advertising providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on Nelson Companies Sites. In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers are delivered to users (in conjunction with Nelson Companies Services) by such Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising providers on their behalf, and not by Nelson Companies; as such, the Third-party advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Nelson Privacy Code, and users should consult the privacy policies of such Third Party advertisers.



Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers, the user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the user has received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. The user should understand that while Nelson Companies do not require a user to use cookies, certain Nelson Companies Services will not function properly if a user sets his/her browser to not accept cookies.

_Web Beacons_  
Certain Nelson Companies Services may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes called single-pixel gifs – that allow Nelson Companies to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access Personal Information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about Nelson Companies service usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Certain Nelson Companies Services web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by Nelson Companies’ advertising partners to help Nelson Companies determine the effectiveness of Nelson Companies’ Internet advertising campaigns.

_Links To Other Sites And Advertisements_  
A Nelson Companies Service may contain links to other websites and services. While Nelson Companies try to link only to sites and services that share Nelson Companies’ high standards and respect for privacy, a user should understand that Nelson Companies are not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites. This Nelson Privacy Code applies only to the Nelson Companies Services related to this Nelson Privacy Code.

_Additional Information_  
Nelson Companies automatically collect certain information about the user’s computer hardware and software. This information may include: browser type, operating system type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by Nelson Companies to operate the service, to maintain the quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Nelson Companies Sites.  
Certain Nelson Companies Services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If a user registers for or uses such services, both Nelson Companies and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.

Nelson may also collect, use or disclose Personal Information without knowledge or consent if seeking the consent of the Person might defeat the purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law.

Nelson may also use or disclose Personal Information without knowledge or consent in the case of an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual or property is threatened.

9.2 In certain situations, Nelson may not be able to provide access to all of the Personal Information that they hold about a Person. For example, Nelson may not provide access to information if doing so would likely reveal Personal Information about a Third Party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another person. Also, Nelson may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information, if the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege, if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law, or if the information was collected as part of journalistic, literary or artistic activities. If access to Personal Information cannot be provided, Nelson shall provide the reasons for denying access upon request.

9.3 Upon request, Nelson shall provide an account of the use and disclosure of Personal Information and, where reasonably possible, shall state the source of the information. In providing an account of disclosure, Nelson shall provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed Personal Information about the individual when it is not possible to provide an actual list.

9.3 In order to safeguard Personal Information, an individual or employee may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit Nelson to account for the existence, use and disclosure of Personal Information and to authorize access to the individual’s file. Any such information shall be used only for this purpose.

9.4 Nelson shall promptly correct or complete any Personal Information found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any unresolved differences as to accuracy or completeness shall be noted in the Person’s file. Where appropriate, Nelson shall transmit to third parties having access to the Personal Information in question any amended information or the existence of any unresolved differences.

9.5 A Person can obtain information or seek access to his or her Personal Information by contacting a designated representative at Nelson principal office.

9.6 An employee can obtain information or seek access to his or her Personal Information by contacting his or her immediate supervisor within Nelson.

A Person shall be informed of the outcome of the investigation regarding his or her complaint.

_1_ _The inclusion of independent contractors, including freelancers, within the definition of “Employee” is for convenience of reference only, and does in no manner imply that such individuals are employees of the company within the meaning of employment legislation or are in an employee-employer relationship with the company._
