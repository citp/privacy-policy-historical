      <h3>Scope And Application Of The Nelson Privacy Code:</h3>
      <p>The scope and application of the Nelson Privacy Code are as follows: </p>
      <p>The Nelson Privacy Code applies to Personal Information about Nelson

        <li>Employees in this context includes past and present employees
        and independent contractors of Nelson.</li>
        <li>          Non-employee Persons in this context includes Individuals

              job applicants,
            Internet users who are exposed to the media content of Nelson or
        a Nelson Company and about whom Nelson collects Personal Information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Nelson Privacy Code applies to the management of Personal Information
          in any form whether oral, electronic or written. Nelson reserves the
        right to amend this Nelson Privacy Code from time to time.</p>
      <p>The application
          of the Nelson Privacy Code is subject to the requirements or provisions
          of any applicable legislation, regulations or agreements
          (such as collective agreements), or the order of any court or other
        lawful authority.</p>
      <p><u><strong>Exclusions from privacy protection:</strong></u> The Nelson
        Privacy Code does not impose any limits on the collection, use or disclosure
        of the following
        information by a Nelson Company: a) information that is publicly available,
        such as a Person’s name, address, telephone number and electronic

        assistance; b) business-contact information, such as the name, title
        or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization;
        c) information collected, used or disclosed in the course of journalistic,
        literary or artistic activities; or d) aggregate information that cannot
        be associated with a specific person, such as demographic statistics
        about Nelson customers, or number of visitors and average time spent
        on a website.</p>
      <h3>Purposes for Collection of Personal Information:</h3>
      <p>Nelson has collected and collects Personal Information for the following
        purposes: a) to establish and maintain responsible commercial relations
        with Individuals and to provide ongoing service; b) to understand Individual
        needs; c) to develop, enhance, market or provide products and services;
        d) to manage and develop its business and operations, including personnel
        and employment matters; and e) to meet legal or regulatory requirements,
        including to protect or defend a legal interest, and in connection with
        an actual or possible Nelson corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation
        with another entity, or an actual or possible sale of all or a substantial
        portion of the assets of Nelson, provided that the Personal Information
        disclosed continues to be used by the entity acquiring the information
        either for evaluation of the possible transaction, or, on completion
      of any such transaction, for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>As examples of the above:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i)	Nelson may from time to time use a Person’s Personal Information
            to contact the Person about changes, enhancements or similar notices
            related to Nelson Companies products and services; </p>
        <p>ii) if a Person indicated that he/she was interested in receiving offers
          or information from Nelson or one or more Nelson Companies or certain
          of our selected sponsors or advertisers, Nelson may send the Person materials
          about products and services that Nelson feels may be of interest to the
          Person; and</p>
        <p>iii) if a Person enters a contest or other promotion offered on a
          Nelson Companies website, Nelson may, under the rules of the promotion,
          use
            the Person’s name and certain other information to administer
            the promotion, such as contacting, announcing and promoting the winners
            of
        the promotion.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Obtaining Consent:</h3>
      <p>Nelson will make a reasonable effort to make sure Persons understand
        how their Personal Information will be used by Nelson. Nelson will obtain
        consent from Persons before or when it collects or uses the Personal
        Information. Nelson will not attempt to deceive Persons into giving consent. </p>
      <p>A Person’s consent can be express, implied, or given through an
        authorized representative. A Person can withdraw consent at any time,
        with certain exceptions noted herein. Nelson, however, may collect, use
        or disclose Personal Information without the Person’s knowledge
        or consent in exceptional circumstances where such collection, use or
        disclosure is permitted or as required by law. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Note: If any Person at any time has any questions or concerns about
          Nelson’s privacy practices, the Person can either:<br>
          i) write to Customer Service – Privacy, Nelson Thomson Learning,
          1120 Birchmount Road, Toronto, ON, M1K 5G4; or<br>
          ii) provide information to Nelson through the <a href="#privacyform">form
          on its Internet Privacy page</a>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>        Refusing or withdrawing Consent:</h3>
      <p>Subject to legal and contractual requirements, a Person can refuse to
        consent to Nelson’s collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information
        about the Person, or a Person may withdraw the Person’s consent
        to Nelson’s further collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information
        at any time in the future by giving Nelson reasonable notice, unless:
        i) the consent relates to certain information required for credit approval
        which a Person applies for or accepts, ii) the consent is otherwise required
        by law or iii) the use or disclosure is permitted by law or is related
        to the legal or regulatory requirements described herein. If a Person
        refuses or withdraws the Person’s consent, Nelson may not be able
        to provide the Person or continue to provide the Person with some products,
        services or information which may be of value to the Person.</p>
      <h3>        Internet Aspects:</h3>
      <p>Personal Information may be collected when a user conducts activities
        on or related to all websites of Nelson Companies (“Nelson Companies
        Sites”) or related to services made available on the Nelson Companies
        Sites (“Nelson Companies Services”). Although information
        collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below often
        does not constitute Personal Information (and to the extent that such
        is the case, then the obligations under the Nelson Privacy Code do not
        extend to such information), Nelson provides the details below about
        Internet aspects of Nelson Companies Services for the purposes of disclosure
        about Nelson Companies Services.</p>
      <p><u>        Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)</u><br>
        When the user’s web browser requests a web page from another computer
        on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where
        it should send the information. This address is called the computer's "IP
        address." For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet
        service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the
        user logs on.</p>
      <p>Nelson Companies may use the user’s IP Address to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported
          by the user’s or Nelson Company’s technical team.</li>
        <li> display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers
          of) more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as
          content and advertising based on the user’s geographic area.</li>
        <li> estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations.
              Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service
              providers,
            universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities.
            Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported
            to advertisers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><u>Cookies</u><br>
        A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique
          identifier, that is sent to the user’s web browser from a web
          site's computers and is stored on the user’s computer's hard
          drive. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to
          a user’s computer.</p>
      <p>Nelson Companies may use cookies to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> improve the operation and performance of the Nelson Companies Services
          and to make Nelson Companies Services easier and more convenient to
          use. For example, cookies help Nelson Companies provide more personalized
          services by recalling user preferences on subsequent visits (e.g. language
          preference). Cookies also allow Nelson Companies to save passwords
          and
          preferences for a user so that the user will not have to re-enter them
          on the next visit to a Nelson Companies Site;</li>
        <li> measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related
            to Nelson Companies Services and advertisements (e.g. number of users,
            average time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information
            helps Nelson Companies to better understand when to update, change
          or offer new services and provides Nelson Companies with details as
          to the
            performance of Third Party advertisements and content. This information
            may be reported, in aggregate form only, to Nelson Companies’ current
            and prospective sponsors, advertisers and business partners. No Personal
            Information will be disclosed in such reports;</li>
        <li>display advertisements. Nelson Companies and Third Party advertising
            providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on Nelson Companies
            Sites. In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers
          are delivered to users (in conjunction with Nelson Companies Services)
          by
            such Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising
            providers on their behalf, and not by Nelson Companies; as such,
          the Third-party advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own
          privacy
            policies, not the Nelson Privacy Code, and users should consult the
          privacy policies of such Third Party advertisers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers,
        the user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the
        user has received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. The user
        should understand that while Nelson Companies do not require a user to
        use cookies, certain Nelson Companies Services will not function properly
        if a user sets his/her browser to not accept cookies.</p>
      <p><u>Web Beacons</u><br>
        Certain Nelson Companies Services may contain electronic images known
          as Web beacons – sometimes called single-pixel gifs – that
          allow Nelson Companies to count users who have visited those pages
          and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access
          Personal Information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated
          statistics about Nelson Companies service usage. Web beacons collect
          only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and
          date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web
          beacon resides. Certain Nelson Companies Services web pages may also
          contain Web beacons placed there by Nelson Companies’ advertising
          partners to help Nelson Companies determine the effectiveness of Nelson
          Companies’ Internet advertising campaigns.</p>
      <p><u>Links To Other Sites And Advertisements</u><br>
        A Nelson Companies Service may contain links to other websites and services.
          While Nelson Companies try to link only to sites and services that
          share Nelson Companies’ high standards and respect for privacy,
          a user should understand that Nelson Companies are not responsible
          for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other companies
          or websites. This Nelson Privacy Code applies only to the Nelson Companies
        Services related to this Nelson Privacy Code.</p>
      <p> <u>Additional Information</u><br>
        Nelson Companies automatically collect certain information about the
        user’s computer hardware and software. This information may include:
        browser type, operating system type, domain names, access times and referring
        Web site addresses. This information is used by Nelson Companies to operate
        the service, to maintain the quality of the service, and to provide general
        statistics regarding use of the Nelson Companies Sites.<br>
        Certain Nelson Companies Services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction
        with another company. If a user registers for or uses such services,
        both Nelson Companies and the other company may receive information collected
        in conjunction with the co-branded services. </p>

      <p>Nelson is responsible for Personal Information under its control and
        shall designate one or more persons who are accountable for Nelson’s
        compliance with the following principles.</p>
      <p>1.1 Responsibility for ensuring compliance with the provisions of the
        Nelson Privacy Code rests with the senior management of Nelson, which
        shall designate one or more persons to be accountable for compliance
        with the Nelson Privacy Code. Other people within Nelson Companies may
        be delegated to act on behalf of the designated person(s) or to take
        responsibility for the day-to- day collection and processing of Personal
        Information.</p>
      <p>1.2 Nelson has designated a Chief Privacy Officer to oversee compliance
        with the Nelson Privacy Code. The Chief Privacy Officer can be contacted
        at Chief Privacy Officer, 1120 Birchmount Road, Toronto, Ontario, M1K
        5G4.</p>
      <p>1.3 Nelson is responsible for Personal Information in its possession
        or control, including information that has been transferred to a Third
        Party for processing. Nelson shall use appropriate means to provide a
        comparable level of protection while information is being processed by
        a Third Party (see Principle 7).</p>
      <p>1.4 Nelson has implemented policies and procedures to give effect to
        the Nelson Privacy Code, including: a) implementing procedures to protect

        Nelson Privacy Code; b) establishing procedures to receive and respond
        to inquiries or complaints; c) training and communicating to staff about
        Nelson’s policies and practices; and d) developing public information
        to explain Nelson’s policies and practices.</p>
      <h3>Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes for Collection of Personal Information </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson has collected and collects Personal Information for the purposes
        set out below, and shall identify the purposes for which Personal Information
        is collected at or before the time the information is collected.</em></p>
      <p>2.1 Nelson has collected and collects Personal Information for the following
        purposes: a) to establish and maintain responsible commercial relations
        with Individuals and to provide ongoing service; b) to understand Individual
        needs; c) to develop, enhance, market or provide products and services;
        d) to manage and develop its business and operations, including personnel
        and employment matters; and e) to meet legal or regulatory requirements,
        including to protect or defend a legal interest, and in connection with
        an actual or possible Nelson corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation
        with another entity, or an actual or possible sale of all or a substantial
        portion of the assets of Nelson, provided that the Personal Information
        disclosed continues to be used by the entity acquiring the information
        either for evaluation of the possible transaction, or, on completion
        of any such transaction, for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>As examples of the above:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i)	Nelson may from time to time use a Person’s Personal Information
                  to contact the Person about changes, enhancements or similar
          notices related to Nelson Companies products and services; </p>
        <p>ii) if a Person indicated that he/she was interested in receiving
            offers or information from Nelson or one or more Nelson Companies or
            certain
              of our selected sponsors or advertisers, Nelson may send the Person
            materials about products and services that Nelson feels may be of interest
            to the
              Person; and</p>
        <p>iii) if a Person enters a contest or other promotion offered on a
                Nelson Companies website, Nelson may, under the rules of the
          promotion, use
                  the Person’s name and certain other information to administer
                  the promotion, such as contacting, announcing and promoting
                  the winners of
                  the promotion.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Further references to “identified purposes” mean the purposes
        identified in this Principle 2.</p>
      <p>2.2 Nelson shall specify orally, electronically or in writing the identified
        purposes to the Person at or before the time Personal Information is
        collected. Upon request, persons collecting Personal Information shall
        explain these identified purposes or refer the Person to a designated
        person within Nelson who shall explain the purposes.</p>
      <p>2.3 Unless required by law, Nelson shall not use or disclose, for any
        new purpose, Personal Information that has been collected without first
        identifying the new purpose and obtaining the consent of the Person.</p>
      <h3>Principle 3 - Obtaining Consent for Collection, Use or Disclosure of
        Personal Information </h3>
      <p><em>The knowledge and consent of a Person are required for the collection,
        use or disclosure of Personal Information, except where inappropriate.</em></p>
      <p>3.1 Generally, Nelson shall seek consent to use and disclose Personal
        Information at the same time it collects the information. However, Nelson
        may seek consent to use and disclose Personal Information after it has
        been collected but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.</p>
      <p>3.2 In obtaining consent, Nelson shall use reasonable efforts to ensure
        that a Person is advised of the identified purposes for which Personal
        Information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated in a
        manner that can be reasonably understood by the Person.</p>
      <p>3.3 Nelson will require Individuals to consent to the collection, use
        or disclosure of Personal Information as a condition of the supply of
        a product or service only if such collection, use or disclosure is required
        to fulfill the identified purposes.</p>
      <p>3.4 In determining the appropriate form of consent, Nelson shall take
        into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the reasonable
        expectations of the Persons.</p>
      <p>3.5 In general, the use of products and services by an Individual, or
        the acceptance of employment or benefits by an Employee, constitutes
        implied consent for Nelson to collect, use and disclose Personal Information
        for all identified purposes.</p>
      <p>3.6 An Individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal
        or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Individuals may contact
        Nelson for more information regarding the implications of withdrawing
        consent.</p>
      <p>3.7 In certain circumstances Personal Information can be collected,
        used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the Person. For
        example, Nelson may collect or use Personal Information without knowledge
        or consent if it is clearly in the interests of the Person and consent
        cannot be obtained in a timely way, such as when the Person is a minor,
        seriously ill or mentally incapacitated.</p>
      <p>Nelson may also collect, use or disclose Personal Information without
        knowledge or consent if seeking the consent of the Person might defeat
        the purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation
        of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial
        law.</p>
      <p>Nelson may also use or disclose Personal Information without knowledge
        or consent in the case of an emergency where the life, health or security
        of an individual or property is threatened.</p>
      <p>Nelson may disclose Personal Information without knowledge or consent
        to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court
        order, or as may be otherwise related to the legal or regulatory requirements
        described herein.</p>
      <h3>Principle 4 - Limiting Collection of Personal Information </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson shall limit the collection of Personal Information to that which
        is necessary for the purposes identified by Nelson.</em></p>
      <p><em>Nelson shall collect Personal Information by fair and lawful means.</em></p>
      <p>4.1 Nelson collects Personal Information primarily from Individuals
        or its Employees.</p>
      <p>4.2 Nelson may also collect Personal Information from other sources
        including credit bureaus, employers or personal references, or other
        third parties that represent that they have the right to disclose the
        information.</p>
      <h3>Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson shall not use or disclose Personal Information for purposes other
        than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the
        Person or as required by law. Nelson shall retain Personal Information
        only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which
        it was collected.</em></p>
      <p>5.1 In certain circumstances Personal Information can be collected,
        used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the Person. (See
        Principle 3.7) </p>
      <p>5.2 In addition, Nelson may disclose a Person’s Personal Information
        to: a) another person for the development, enhancement, marketing or
        provision of any of the products or services of Nelson; b) a person who,
        in the reasonable judgment of the Nelson Companies, is seeking the information
        as an agent of the Person; c) any Nelson Companies to permit the provision
        of services requested by the Person, and d) a Third Party or Third Parties,
        where the Person consents to such disclosure or disclosure is required
        by law.</p>
      <p>5.3 Nelson may disclose Personal Information about its employees: a)
        for normal personnel and benefits administration; b) in the context of
        providing references regarding current or former employees in response
        to requests from prospective employers; or c) where disclosure is required
        by law.</p>
      <p>5.4 Only those Employees of Nelson who require access for business reasons,
        or whose duties reasonably so require, or properly designated representatives
        of Nelson, are granted access to Personal Information about Individuals
        and Employees.</p>
      <p>5.5 Nelson shall keep Personal Information only as long as it remains
        necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or as required by law.
        Depending on the circumstances, where Personal Information has been used
        to make a decision about a Person, Nelson shall retain, for a period
        of time that is reasonably sufficient to allow for access by the Person,
        either the actual information or the rationale for making the decision.</p>
      <p>5.6 Nelson shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, schedules
        and practices for information and records retention and destruction which
        apply to Personal Information that is no longer necessary or relevant
        for the identified purposes or required by law to be retained. Such information
        shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous.</p>
      <h3>Principle 6 - Accuracy of Personal Information </h3>
      <em>Personal Information shall be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as
        is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.</em>      <p>6.1 Personal Information used by Nelson shall be sufficiently accurate,
        complete and up-to-date to minimize the possibility that inappropriate
        information may be used to make a decision about a Person.</p>
      <p>6.2 Nelson shall update Personal Information about Persons as and when
        necessary to fulfill the identified purposes or upon notification by
        the Person.</p>
      <h3>Principle 7 - Security Safeguards </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson shall protect Personal Information by security safeguards appropriate
        to the sensitivity of the information.</em></p>
      <p>7.1 Nelson shall protect Personal Information against such risks as
        loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, modification
        or destruction, through appropriate security measures. Nelson shall protect
        the information regardless of the format in which it is held.</p>
      <p>7.2 Nelson shall protect Personal Information disclosed to third parties
        by contractual agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the information
        and the purposes for which it is to be used.</p>
      <p>7.3 All employees of Nelson with access to Personal Information shall
        be required as a condition of employment to respect the confidentiality
        of Personal Information.</p>
      <h3>Principle 8 - Openness Concerning Policies and Practices </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson shall make readily available to Persons specific information
        about its policies and practices relating to the management of Personal
        Information.</em></p>
      <p>8.1 Nelson shall make information about its policies and practices easy
        to understand, including: a) The title and address of the person or persons
        accountable for the compliance with the Nelson Privacy Code and to whom
        inquiries or complaints can be forwarded; b) The means of gaining access
        to Personal Information held by Nelson; and c) A description of the type
        of Personal Information held by Nelson, including a general account of
        its use.</p>
      <p>8.2 Nelson shall make available information to help Persons exercise
        choices regarding the use of their Personal Information.</p>
      <h3>Principle 9 - Access to Personal Information </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson shall inform a Person of the existence, use and disclosure of
        his or her Personal Information upon request and shall give the Person
        access to that information.</em></p>
      <p>A Person shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of
        the Personal Information and have it amended as appropriate.</p>
      <p>9.1 Upon request, Nelson shall afford to a Person a reasonable opportunity
        to review the Personal Information in the Person’s file. Personal
        Information shall be provided in understandable form within a reasonable
        time and at minimal or no cost to the Person.</p>
      <p>9.2 In certain situations, Nelson may not be able to provide access
        to all of the Personal Information that they hold about a Person. For
        example, Nelson may not provide access to information if doing so would
        likely reveal Personal Information about a Third Party or could reasonably
        be expected to threaten the life or security of another person. Also,
        Nelson may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal
        confidential commercial information, if the information is protected
        by solicitor-client privilege, if the information was generated in the
        course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the information
        was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement
        or a contravention of a federal or provincial law, or if the information
        was collected as part of journalistic, literary or artistic activities.
        If access to Personal Information cannot be provided, Nelson shall provide
        the reasons for denying access upon request.</p>
      <p>9.3 Upon request, Nelson shall provide an account of the use and disclosure
        of Personal Information and, where reasonably possible, shall state the
        source of the information. In providing an account of disclosure, Nelson
        shall provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed
        Personal Information about the individual when it is not possible to
        provide an actual list.</p>
      <p>9.3 In order to safeguard Personal Information, an individual or employee
        may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit
        Nelson to account for the existence, use and disclosure of Personal Information
        and to authorize access to the individual’s file. Any such information
        shall be used only for this purpose.</p>
      <p>9.4 Nelson shall promptly correct or complete any Personal Information
        found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any unresolved differences as to
        accuracy or completeness shall be noted in the Person’s file. Where
        appropriate, Nelson shall transmit to third parties having access to
        the Personal Information in question any amended information or the existence
        of any unresolved differences.</p>
      <p>9.5 A Person can obtain information or seek access to his or her Personal
        Information by contacting a designated representative at Nelson principal
        office.</p>
      <p>9.6 An employee can obtain information or seek access to his or her
        Personal Information by contacting his or her immediate supervisor within
        Nelson.</p>
      <h3>Principle 10 - Challenging Compliance </h3>
      <p><em>A Person shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance
        with the above principles to the designated person or persons accountable
        for the compliance of Nelson with the Nelson Privacy Code.</em></p>
      <p>10.1 Nelson shall maintain procedures for addressing and responding
        to all inquiries or complaints from Persons about Nelson’s handling
        of their Personal Information. If any Person at any time has any questions
        or concerns about Nelson’s privacy practices, the Person can either:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> i) write to Customer Service – Privacy, Nelson Thomson Learning,
          1120 Birchmount Road, Toronto, ON, M1K 5G4; or<br>
          ii) provide information to Nelson through <a href="#privacyform">the
          form on its Internet Privacy page</a>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>10.2 Nelson shall inform Persons about the existence of these procedures
        as well as the availability of complaint procedures.</p>
      <p>10.3 The person or persons accountable for compliance with the Nelson
        Privacy Code may seek external advice where appropriate before providing
        a final response to individual complaints.</p>
      <p>10.4 Nelson shall investigate all complaints concerning compliance with
        the Nelson Privacy Code. If a complaint is found to be justified, Nelson
        shall take appropriate measures to resolve the complaint including, if
        necessary, amending its policies and procedures. A Person shall be informed
        of the outcome of the investigation regarding his or her complaint.</p>
