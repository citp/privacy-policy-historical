### __Our Security Procedures

We are committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable online experience. We implement reasonable and appropriate physical, procedural, and electronic safeguards to protect your information.

To access information and send email via the website, you will need a browser that supports the use of Secure Sockets Layer. This encryption technology helps ensure the authenticity of your online sessions and secures data transmitted over the public Internet.

Nelnet takes careful steps to safeguard customer information. We restrict access to your personal and account information to employees who need to know the information to provide services to you, and we regularly train our employees on privacy, information security, and their obligation to protect your information. We maintain reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your Nonpublic Personal Information (NPI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and we regularly test those safeguards to maintain the appropriate levels of protection.

You can help safeguard your NPI and PII by taking a few simple precautions. Protect your account numbers, passwords, and customer access numbers. Never disclose confidential information to unknown callers. You should always use a secure browser and current virus detection software, and never open email from unknown sources.

### __Children's Privacy

The website is not directed to children under age 13. We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use PII from children under age 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us PII without their consent, he or she should contact us using the information in the ["How to Contact Us"](https://web.archive.org/privacy-and-security#how-to-contact-us) section.

### __Links to Other Websites and Services

We are not responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose websites may contain links to our website, including vendors where you may shop. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website, our policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service are subject to that third party's own rules and policies. Please note that when you shop with a vendor linked to the website, even though you may have started your visit with us, and even though our pages may still appear, your transactions are completed with a separate organization, not with us. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible, and we do not have control over any third parties that you authorize to access your user content. If you are using a third-party website or service, and you allow a third party access to your user content, you do so at your own risk. This policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from sources other than through the website and mobile app(s).

## Privacy Notice for European Union Residents

**Effective Date: December 6, 2019**

Striving to provide superior customer service, Nelnet places great emphasis on its customers and their privacy rights. In doing so, Nelnet will comply with European Union Privacy Directives, most notably the EU General Data Protection Regulation. By providing our services, we may from time to time collect, store, use, or process your personal data for legitimate business purposes, such as improving our products and services. Nelnet’s processing of your data is necessary for compliance with its contractual and legal obligations. Personal data means any identifier information, such as your name, social security number, identification number, location data, or other online identifiers and factors.

Although your data is generally stored within the United States, an international data transfer may occur if third-party, cloud-based storage companies that Nelnet employs use servers located outside the United States. Nelnet uses appropriate technical and organizational security measures including encryption of personal data and follows various industry standards and best practices to protect your personal data. Additionally, Nelnet requires its vendors and processors to abide by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and to apply adequate security and technical safeguards. We will not transfer your data to or store your data in countries that have not been awarded an adequacy decision by the European Commission.

For general processing purposes, Nelnet will store your personal data for a period of seven years after full payment of the loan balance. However, Nelnet may retain such information for longer periods where legally required to do so based on its contract or other legal obligations.

You have the right to withdraw consent for processing at any time. Further, you have the right to request access to and rectification, restriction, or erasure of your personal data. Nelnet will afford you these rights, but it may not be able to do so where the processing is based on its contractual obligations, based on other legitimate interests, or carried out in the public interest. Along with these rights, if you believe that your data has been mishandled in violation of a privacy directive, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. If you have questions or concerns about our data processing practices, please address such inquiries to our Data Protection Officer.
