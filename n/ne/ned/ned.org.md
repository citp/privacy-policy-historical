# Privacy Policy – NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY

**Introduction**

This Privacy Notice describes NED’s policies and practices regarding its collection and use of your personal data, and sets forth your privacy rights. We recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so from time to time we will update this Privacy Notice as we undertake new personal data practices or adopt new privacy policies.

The National Endowment for Democracy (NED), located in Washington, DC, is a private, nonprofit charitable organization dedicated to the growth and strengthening of democratic institutions around the world primarily through the awarding of grants to nongovernmental organizations. NED is committed to transparency as one of the core principles of democracy.

NED collects personal information from those who choose to interact with us. With a few exceptions, this information is limited to the kinds of information that can be found on a business card: first name, last name, job title, employer name, work address, work email, and work phone number. We use this information to provide certain benefits, including distributing information updates, event invitations, and the like. We do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive information from minors. We do not sell personal information to anyone and only share with third parties who are facilitating the delivery of NED offerings. 

You may enjoy many of NED’s offerings without giving us your personal data. The information on our website is available to the general public. With certain offerings, some personal information is necessary so that NED can provide you with what you requested. You may manage your NED subscriptions and you may opt-out of receiving general informational communication at any time.

**How we collect and use your personal information you give to us**

NED receives data from you to provide you with benefits you have requested from us, including information on upcoming events, publications, and other content, or to review applications to become the recipient of a grant or fellowship, or seek employment from us. We may use this information to refine our offerings to better tailor them to your needs and to communicate with you about other NED offerings.

**When and how we share information with others**

As a recipient federal appropriations and funding from other entities, NED is required to provide certain information regarding parties who are beneficiaries of these funds.  Such information may be shared in the course of fulfilling standard compliance and reporting requirements in adherence with the terms of the entity’s grant to NED, as well as to comply with U.S. law, to include the NED Act.  These requirements also include provisions to protect individuals’ privacy.

We do not reveal your personal data to third-parties for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) the information is provided to a NED event co-sponsor on a per-event basis; (3) the information is provided to comply with the law, enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others; (4) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform functions on our behalf; (5) to address emergencies or acts of God; or (6) to address disputes, claims, or to persons demonstrating legal authority to act on your behalf. We may also gather aggregated data about site visitors and disclose the results of such aggregated (but not personally identifiable) information to our partners or service providers.

To protect personally identifiable information, NED’s internal systems follow appropriate best practice information security protocols. When sharing information, NED makes every effort to remain transparent about its activities, while still protecting sensitive and/or personally identifiable information.
