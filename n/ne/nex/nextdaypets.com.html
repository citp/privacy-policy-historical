              Next Day Pets, L.L.C. is the sole owner of the information collected 
              on this Site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information 
              to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.</p>
                    
                  <p> In order for a user to access contact information for non-subscribing 
                    members and/or place listings the user must first complete 
                    the registration form. During registration a user is required 
                    to give their contact information (such as name, address, 
                    phone number, and email address). This information is used 
                    to contact the user about the services on our site for which 
                    they have expressed interest and may be shared with other 
                    companies who use the information in aggregate to gather broad 
                    demographic information. We request information from the user 
                    on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information 
                    and financial information (like credit card number, expiration 
                    date). This information is used for billing purposes and to 
                    fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing 
                    an order, this contact information is used to get in touch 
                    with the user. </p>
                  <p>If you elect to use the Breeder Escrow process to purchase 
                    a dog through a secured trust account on Escrow.com then the 
                    information you submit will be sent to Escrow.com for transactional 
                    purposes only. By placing ads on nextdaypets.com you understand 
                    that if a buyer wishes to purchase a dog from you using Escrow.com 
                    then Next Day Pets will pass the first name, last name and 
                    email address that you used when creating an account on nextdaypets.com 
                    for transactional purposes only. </p>
            <p>Next Day Pets, L.L.C. will take reasonable measures to not disclose 
              the contents of your communications unless required to do so by 
              law or in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary 
              to: (i) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process 
              served on Next Day Pets' website; (ii) protect and defend the rights 
              or property of Next Day Pets or enforce or further the application 
              or intent of the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) act to protect 
              the personal safety of Next Day Pets participants or the public. 
              <br>
              From time to time, Next Day Pets may make various aspects of our 
              database of Your Information available to other parties for promotions

              interest to Next Day Pets members. However, we will not distribute 
              personal information about any individual -- in other words, while 
              we might let our advertisers know that we have 1000 people in your 
              zip code, we won't let advertisers know that YOU live in your zip 
              code. However, by accepting this Agreement, you expressly consent 
              to such use and disclosure of non-personally identifiable information. 
              Please note that Next Day Pets maintains the right to send you periodic

              provide any information to other parties, or any other sites you 
              encounter on Next Day Pets or the Internet, different rules may 
              apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you 
              disclose to them. We may, however, use and disclose general data 
              and/or statistical data that includes data about you and/or your 
              listings in order to provide better service to you and other users,

            <p class="txtPurple12">COOKIES</p>
            <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive

            <p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track 
              user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information 
              for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable 
              information.</p>

              Next Day Pets, L.L.C. is not responsible for the privacy practices 
              of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they 
              leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every 
              web site that collects personally identifiable information. This 
              privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this 
              Web site.</p>
            <p class="txtPurple12">REFER-A-FRIEND</p>
            <p> If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend 
              about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email 
              address. Next Day Pets, L.L.C. will automatically send the friend

            <p class="txtPurple12"> SECURITY</p>
            <p> This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ 
              information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, 
              your information is protected both online and off-line. <br>
              When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information 
              (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and 
              is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - 
              SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon 
              on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
              Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, 
              when you are just ‘surfing’. To verify our web site 
              security, visit http://www.nextdaypets.com/secure/.<br>
              While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, 
              we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. 
              All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information 
              mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who 
              need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
              billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted 
              access to personally identifiable information. The servers that 
              we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure 
              environment, at a world class facility. </p>
            <p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you 
              can send an email to support@nextdaypets.com.</p>
            <p class="txtPurple12"> SITE AND SERVICE UPDATES</p>
            <p> We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members 
              are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain 
              important information about the service. We communicate with the 
              user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating 
              to their account via email or phone.</p>
            <p class="txtPurple12"> CORRECTING / UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
            <p> If a user’s personally identifiable information changes, 
              or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to 
              provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal 
              data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member account 
              (“my account”) page or by emailing our Customer Support 
              support@nextdaypets.com.</p>
            <p class="txtPurple12"> NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</p>
            <p> Next Day Pets, L.L.C. may update this policy. We will notify you 
              about significant changes in the way we treat personal information 
              by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your 
              Next Day Pets, L.L.C. account or by placing a prominent notice on 
              our site. </p>
