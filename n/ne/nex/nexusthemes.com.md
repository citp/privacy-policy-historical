## 5.1 Reviewing, Correcting and Removing Your Personal Information

The GDPR offers people a number of rights concerning their personal information. We adhere to all of these with respect to data deletion, data transparency, data portability and data modification. When we are legally obliged to retain certain personal information, this obligation trumps the user rights. For instance, a person cannot demand us to delete financial transactions, because this would imply a breach of our legal accounting standards.
