1. Information - We may collect different types of personal and other information based on your
   use of our products and services and our business relationship with you, including contact
   information; billing information, equipment, performance, Nextiva’s website usage, viewing
                                                                                        © 2016 NEXTIVA, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED


   and other technical information about your use of our network, services, products or websites.
   Information may be collected when you give it to us with the intent to purchase or interact
   with us about a product or service we offer or provide; when we collect it automatically when
   you visit our websites or use our products and services; or when we obtain it from other
   sources, such as credit agencies. Our goal of collecting your information is to provide you with
   the best customer experience possible by communicating with you regarding service updates,
   offers and promotions; delivering advertising that may be of interest to you; addressing
   network and security issues; investigating or taking action regarding illegal activities or
   violations of our Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policies.
   We collect some information on an anonymous basis and may anonymize the personal
   information we collect about you into data groups. When we employ non-Nextiva companies
   to anonymize or aggregate data on our behalf, the requirements for sharing Personal
   Information with non-companies apply. We may share aggregate or anonymous information in
   various formats with trusted non-Nextiva entities, with whom we have contracted with to
   aggregate such data and may work with those entities to do research and provide products
   and services. When Nextiva jointly provides a service with a non- Nextiva company, your
   Personal Information may be subject to both this Policy and the privacy policy of the non-
   Nextiva company. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any non- Nextiva
   company with which you do business to determine what information will be collected and how
   it will be used or disclosed to others.
2. Disclosure - We do not sell your Personal Information to anyone for any purpose, and we
   maintain information about you in our business records while you are a customer, or until it is
   no longer needed for business, tax, or legal purposes. We have implemented encryption or
   other appropriate security controls to protect Personal Information when stored or
   transmitted by Nextiva.
   Subject to applicable legal restrictions, such as those that exist for Customer Proprietary
   Network Information (CPNI), the Nextiva family of companies may share your Personal
   Information with each other to make sure your experience is as seamless as possible, and you
   have the full benefit of what Nextiva and its subsidiaries have to offer. Customer Proprietary
   Network Information (CPNI) is information that relates to the quantity, configuration, type,
   destination, location and amount of use of the telecommunications services you purchase from
   us, as well as the information contained in your bills for those services. We collect CPNI in the
   normal course of providing you with telecommunications services. Your telephone number,
   name and address are not CPNI.
   We share your Personal Information only with non-Nextiva companies that perform services
   on our behalf, and only as necessary for them to perform those services. We require those
   non-Nextiva companies to protect any Personal Information they may receive in a manner
   consistent with this policy, and we do not provide Personal Information to non-Nextiva
                                                                                      © 2016 NEXTIVA, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED


   companies for the marketing of their own products and services without your consent. We
   may provide Personal Information to non-Nextiva companies or other third parties for
   purposes such as emergencies, pursuant to court orders, identity verification to prevent fraud
   and identity theft, enforcing of property rights, or obtaining payment for products and services
   that appear on your Nextiva billing statements.
3. Privacy Controls - You can review and correct your Personal Information collected by us. You
   can limit certain types of solicitation communications from Nextiva, including marketing
   contacts made via telephone, e-mail and text messaging by notifying Nextiva. We will provide
   you with notice of changes to this policy. We are happy to correct information found to be
   inaccurate. Customers may verify that appropriate corrections have been made.
4. Internet-based Advertising – Nextiva uses cookies to store information that can be used to
   serve ads relevant to your interests, and to help our advertisers measure the effectiveness of a
   particular advertisement. This helps us tailor ads to your interests. These cookies can not only
   help us ensure that you do not repeatedly see the same ads, but (if you opt-out) they can also
   help us prevent you from seeing targeted ads at all. The information collected with these
   cookies is not personally-identifiable, and we do not associate it with your Personal
   Information.
   You may opt out of Nextiva’s use of data for internet-based advertising. Please keep in mind
   that even after you opt-out, you may still continue to see ads, but they will no longer be
   tailored to your interests.
   Opting-out also does not remove Nextiva cookies. They will remain on your computer, but we
   will not use the data connected to your cookie for our services. Please note that if you delete
   your cookies, you will need to opt-out again to avoid being served targeted ads in the future.
   Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you
   may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

   We have relationships with other third party advertising companies to place advertisements
   on this website and other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for this
   website and other websites. These third party advertising companies may place cookies on
   your computer when you visit our website or other websites so that they can display targeted
   advertisements to you. These third party advertising companies do not collect Personal
   Information in this process, and we do not give any Personal Information to them. However,
   this Privacy Statement does not cover the collection methods or use of the information
   collected by these entities. For more information about third party advertising, please visit the
                                                                                       © 2016 NEXTIVA, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED


   Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). Opt out of being targeted by many third party
   advertising companies by visiting NAI's Consumer Opt-Out orTRUSTe's Opt-Out.
5. Exclusions - Information that you provide to non-Nextiva companies is not covered by this
   Policy. For example: When you download applications or make an online purchase from a
   non-Nextiva company while using Nextiva’s services, the information collected by the
   non-Nextiva company is not subject to this Policy. If you use public forums — such as social
   networking services, Internet bulletin boards, chat rooms, or blogs on Nextiva or non-Nextiva
   websites — you should be aware that any Personal Information you disclose publicly can be
   read, collected, or used by others. Once you choose to reveal Personal Information on such a
   site, the information is publicly available, and Nextiva cannot prevent distribution and use of
   that information by other parties.
   Nextiva may enter into written product or service agreements with business customers that
   contain specific provisions related to the confidentiality, security or other handling of
   information. When provisions of a written product or service agreement differ from or conflict
   with the provisions of this Policy, the terms of the written agreement will apply. In all other
   instances, the terms of this Policy apply.
6. Security - We have established electronic and administrative safeguards designed to secure
   the information we collect, to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of that information
   and to ensure it is used appropriately. Although we strive to keep your Personal Information
   secure, no security measures are absolute, and we cannot guarantee that your Personal
   Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy (for example, as
   the result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this Policy). We will make
   reasonable attempts to notify you if we determine that Nextiva has experienced a security
   breach and there is a reasonably likely risk of identity theft, or where otherwise required by
   law.
7. Policies - We have established policies and practices to meet the expectations of Customers
   and potential customers who have expressed a desire to limit certain types of solicitation
   communications from Nextiva, including marketing contacts made via telephone, e-mail and
   text messaging. You also can request to be removed from these telemarketing lists when you
   receive a marketing or promotional call. Where required by state laws and/or regulations, we
   honor requests from businesses to be removed from our telemarketing lists.
   The FTC maintains a National Do Not Call Registry at donotcall.gov, and your state may
   maintain its own Do Not Call Registry. Putting your number on these Registries also may limit
   our telemarketing calls to that number.
   Our practices as described above are designed to satisfy state and federal legal requirements
   limiting marketing contacts. You should know that those laws and regulations — such as the
                                                                                       © 2016 NEXTIVA, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED


   requirements governing the state and federal "Do Not Call" lists — generally permit companies
   to contact their own current and, in some cases, former customers, even when those
   customers are listed on the federal and state "Do Not Call" lists. Similarly, restricting our use of
   your CPNI will not eliminate all types of Nextiva marketing contacts.
8. Online Advertising - Nextiva works hard to detect and prevent junk e-mails (also referred to
   as "spam" e-mails) from ever reaching your computer. However, if you are receiving unwanted
   spam from a Nextiva e-mail address, please contact us for assistance at
   marketing@nextiva.com.
9. Account Set-Up - When selecting User names and passwords for Nextiva accounts, you
   should choose words or characters that are not obvious. Likewise, you should always keep
   Personal Information such as account numbers, Usernames, passwords or similar information
   in a secure place and not share the information with others.
10. Policy Changes - Information about our Customers and Users, including Personal
   Information, may be transferred as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or
   transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of an insolvency,
   bankruptcy, or receivership in which Customer and User records would be transferred to
   another entity as a result of such a proceeding.
   We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy as necessary to reflect any changes we make
   and to satisfy legal requirements. If we make a material change to this Policy, we will post a
   prominent notice of the change on our websites, and provide you with other appropriate
   notice and choice regarding the use of your information, at least 30 days before the effective
   date.
   Please check our websites periodically for changes to this Privacy Policy.
