·     _Through log files, cookies, and similar technological means_.  When you use our Applications, NEXON may collect information about your use and interaction with those Applications.  The bulk of this information is collected and stored through the use of technological means like cookies, log files, and analytical measurements and tools.  ****

o    Cookies are small pieces of instruction stored on your hard drive or device, not on our Applications.  Cookies may help you navigate the Applications as easily as possible, may allow you to customize your user experience in our Applications, or provide other means of enhancing the services we can deliver through our Applications.  We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to prevent you from reentering your username and password each time you access the Applications.  We collect information using cookies in order to analyze the usage of our Applications, for authentication purposes, and to improve and personalize the services we provide to you.  Cookies may be delivered to your mobile device as part of your access to and use of our Applications.  You may have the option to reject cookies, depending on the Application, your mobile device, and other factors, though rejecting cookies may impair certain functionalities offered from within the Application. ****

o    Log files are small files that typically contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that may be assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. In general, we use log files to monitor traffic on our websites and through our Applications, to troubleshoot technical problems and authenticate users' entitlements to our products.  In the event of user abuse of our websites or Applications, however, we use IP addresses or game system IDs provided by our licensed hardware manufacturers to exercise our right to block access to our websites or Applications.  If available, IP addresses and game system IDs may be used in order to enforce our Terms

o   We may also make use of analytic metrics tools, whether created by us or by third parties, to collect information when you use our games, services, and Applications

§  These tools and technologies use server log files, web beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, the name of your mobile network and mobile provider, browser types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, information about your device, peripheral hardware, software and/or applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, other Internet and website usage information, game state and the date and time of activity on our websites or games, information about how your game is used, including game metrics and statistics, feature usage and purchase history, as well as unique hardware identifiers such as MAC Address, mobile unique device ID (if applicable) and other similar information. 

§  Use of certain analytic tools may require the transmission and/or storage of information about you and your activities on services and devices not controlled by NEXON.  For example, use of Google Analytics, a web analytic service offered by Google Inc. ("Google"), requires that certain information about your activities be transmitted to and stored on Google server based in the US.  On behalf of NEXON, Google will use this information in order to evaluate your usage of this websites and/or Applications (as may be applicable), to make reports on website activities and/or to provide the website operator with other services related to this websites.  Your IP-address collected by Google Analytics will not be matched up with other data of Google.

§  Similarly, certain third party analytic tools may allow the companies offering those tools to collect information on our websites or through our Applications for their own purposes.  In such cases, information collected about you may be combined with information collected independently from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services.  Such information is not subject to this privacy statement, nor is under the control of NEXON.
