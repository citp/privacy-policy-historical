<p>Next Issue Media LLC (“Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared. Please read the following privacy policy (the “Policy”) to learn more about our privacy practices. By visiting any of the websites operated by the Company, and any sub-domains thereof, or using any of our mobile applications and other methods of content distribution (collectively, the “Service”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Policy.</p>
<h4>1. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h4>
<p>This Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other information about you and your computer or device that Company gathers when you are accessing the Service. Also, this Policy covers Company’s treatment of any Personal Information that Company acquires from the publishers whose publications are offered for sale on the Service (“Participating Publishers”) and from our other business partners This Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p>
<h4>2. What Personal Information Does Company Collect?</h4>
<p>The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve the Service. We collect the following types of information from our users.</p>
<h4>3. Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h4>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter on or through the Service. The types of Personal Information collected include e-mail address, name, phone number, billing information, shipping address and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to the Service is covered by this Policy. We may ask for additional information such as age, gender, hobbies and interests. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. For example, if you wish to purchase content or a subscription on the Site, you will need to provide us with the required information to fulfill the purchase. We also collection certain Personal Information that you provide about recipients when you purchase gift subscriptions, as well as your Personal Information that we receive from users who purchase gift subscriptions for you.</p>
<p>The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new products.</p>
<h4>4. Information Collected Automatically:</h4>
<ul>
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Service. Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, the name and identity of your computer, mobile device and other devices, your operating system, browser type and version, CPU speed, connection speed, local information based on IP address, and, with your consent, as derived from GPS or similar features on your mobile device and other devices.</li>
<li>Generally, the Site automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of user visits to our website and its components, which titles are accessed through the Service, and the length and time a user may spend reading those titles, all of which are similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show and how long they watched. Company may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Service so that we can make the Service appealing to as many users as possible, and improve the Service. The Service also collects information about your purchases and activities on the Service, which we may use to present you with offers that we believe may be of interest to you. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our Participating Publishers and other third parties about how our users, collectively, use the Service. We share this type of statistical data so that our Participating Publishers and other third parties also understand how often people use their products and services and our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.</li>
<li>We will also use usage information in order to ensure users adhere to our Terms of Use. For example, a user’s usage information will help us confirm that a user only downloads a periodical or other content a permitted number of times or to a permitted number of devices.</li>
<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Company will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, and while you will not be able to purchase or view content or engage in any other transactions if we don’t know who you are, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. E-mail Communications:</h4>
<p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Company if your computer or device supports this type of program. We use this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, you may opt out of Company’s marketing and promotional messaging by adjusting the settings in your account information. Until you terminate your account with us, you will not be able to opt-out of e-mails providing account related information such as billing, renewal or legal notices.</p>
<h4>6. Personal Information From Other Sources:</h4>
<p>For purposes such as improving personalization of the Service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.</p>
<h4>7. What About Cookies?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer or device to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people.</li>
<li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. You may wish to leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Site’s most essential features.</li>
<li>Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your computer or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Service. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. This Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</li>
</ul>
<h4>8. Will Company Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</h4>
<p>Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We may share your Personal Information only (a) with entities that control, are controlled by or are under common ownership or control with Company, (b) with Participating Publishers, and (c) as described below. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p>
<p>Our Participating Publishers: We share Personal Information about you and data about your purchases and use of the Service with our Participating Publishers so that they may fulfill your purchase and improve their involvement with the Service. Participating Publishers may also use such information to send you offers for other publications and products that they think might be of interest to you, unless you have opted out of receiving such offers. Our Participating Publishers may also use your Personal Information and aggregated information to serve ads and offers to you through the Service, and otherwise in accordance with their applicable privacy policies.</p>
<p>Merchants: In addition to our Participating Publishers, we work closely with a certain other businesses (“Merchants”), which you will easily be able recognize by attribution within the Service. In certain situations, Merchants may operate stores on or through the Service or sell publications or other products or services to you through the Service. In other situations, we provide services, or sell products jointly, with Merchants. We will share user information that is related to your transactions with the applicable Merchants. For example, we may allow Merchants to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers, and we may provide information we have collected from you to a Merchant in non-personally-identifiable form, in order for that Merchant to select the appropriate audience for its advertisements and/or offers. We may also use your interest in a publication about a certain subject (e.g., fashion) to show you ads for products and services related to that Subject from Merchants, but we do not tell those Merchants who you are. Similarly, if you a review a Merchant through the Service, we may provide aggregate data we’ve collected about you to that Merchant so that the Merchant may provide you and its other users with an optimal experience, but, again, we will not tell such Merchant who you are.</p>
<p>Rewards Programs: We may allow you to earn rewards points for certain third-party loyalty rewards programs (“Rewards Programs”) by entering your identification information for a Rewards Program (your “Rewards Program ID”) when you sign up for the Services. We will share your Rewards Program ID and user information that is related to your transactions with the applicable operator of the Rewards Program. For example, if you sign up to earn points with a Rewards Program, we will provide information about amounts you have paid for the Service so that the Rewards Program operator can determine how many rewards points to awards you.</p>
<p>Service Providers: We retain other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages/sending postal mail/sending email/removing repetitive information from user lists/analyzing data/providing marketing assistance/processing credit card payments/and providing customer service. Unless we tell you differently, Company’s service providers do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address unless you authorize us to do so (with the exception of information given to our Participating Publishers, as discussed above). If you do not wish to receive these offers, please adjust the settings in your account information.</p>
<p>Third Party Advertisers: We may, in the future, serve ads on or through the Service from third parties who are neither Participating Publishers nor Merchants. In that event, we may share certain information about you with such advertisers so that they can present you with offers that are relevant to you.</p>
<p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Company, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information may be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
