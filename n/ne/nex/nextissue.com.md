# Privacy Policy - Texture

Privacy Policy

Next Issue Media LLC (“Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared. Please read the following privacy policy (the “Policy”) to learn more about our privacy practices. By visiting any of the websites operated by the Company, and any sub- domains thereof, or using any of our mobile applications and other methods of content distribution (collectively, the “Service”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.

**1.   _What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?_**

This Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other information about you and your computer or device that Company gathers when you are accessing the Service. We may collect Personal Information from you, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising, and to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [support@texture.com.](mailto:support@texture.com)

**2.   _What Information Does Company_ _Collect?_**

We collect Personal Information you enter on or through the Service, such as when you create a Texture account, purchase a product, or contact us.  The Personal Information we collect includes your email address, name, phone number, billing information, billing address, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook, Amazon or other third party sites). We also collect information associated with your use of the application in order to make personalized recommendations. If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to the Service is covered by this Policy. We may ask for additional information such as age, gender, hobbies, and interests. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. For example, if you wish to purchase content or a subscription on the Site, you will need to provide us with certain minimum information to fulfill the purchase.

When you purchase gift subscriptions, we may collect the information you provide about the gift recipients, including name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.  We will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant service, or for anti-fraud purposes.

The Personal Information we collect allows us to respond to your requests, improve our products and services, customize the advertising and content you see, and communicate with you about specials and new products.

If you do not want to receive emails from us, you may opt out of Company’s marketing and promotional messaging by adjusting the settings in your account information. However, while you maintain a subscription with Company, you will not be able to opt out of emails that send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.

We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personally identifying information for any purpose.

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Service. Company automatically collects information on our server logs from your browser including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the name and identity of your computer, mobile device and other devices, your operating system, browser type and version, CPU speed, connection speed, and locale information based on IP address. To the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.

The Site collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of user visits to our website and its components, which titles are accessed through the Service, and the length and time a user may spend reading those titles, all of which are similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show and how long they watched. Company may use this data in aggregate form to evaluate how often users use parts of the Service so that we can make the Service appealing to as many users as possible, and improve the Service.

We also collect information about your purchases and activities on the Service, which we may use to present you with offers that we believe may be of interest to you. As part of this use of information, we may provide non-personally identifying, aggregate information to our Participating Publishers and other third parties about how our users, collectively, use the Service.

We will also use usage information in order to ensure users adhere to our Terms of Use. For example, a user’s usage information will help us confirm that a user only downloads a periodical or other content a permitted number of times or to a permitted number of devices.

**3.   _What about cookies?_**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer or device to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent or limit your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. You may wish to leave the cookies activated because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Site’s most essential features.

**4.   _Will Company Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?_**

Personal Information will only be shared by Company to provide or improve our products, services, and to contact you about our services; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.

Service Providers: We retain other companies to perform tasks on our behalf and may share your Personal Information with them to assist us to provide products or services to you. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail, sending email, removing repetitive information from user lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies are obligated to protect your Personal Information.

Others: We may access, read, preserve, disclose, or release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with law and enforce or apply our Terms of Use; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others.

**5.   _Is Personal Information About You Secure?_**

We allow you to limit access to your account via a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You are responsible for ensuring against unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to encrypt your Personal Information during transmission. However, because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, Company cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information in its possession or the security of its servers or databases. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

In the unlikely event that Company believes that the security of your Personal Information in its possession or control may have been compromised, Company may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, Company may notify you by email, messaging to your device, or other means.

**6.   _What Personal Information Can You Access?_**

Company allows you to access the following information about you for the purpose of viewing, and in certain situations, updating that information: email address, name, and marketing preferences, and the Participating Publisher’s account number(s) (in the case of print subscriptions). This list may change as the Service changes. The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Website changes. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at support@texture.com or at Next Issue Media LLC, 1 Apple Park Way, Cupertino, CA 95014, USA, Attn: Legal.

You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the “What Personal Information Can I Access” section above. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.

Upon your written request to [support@texture.com, ](mailto:support@texture.com)we will remove your Personal Information from our active user database provided that (a) you are current with all payment obligations, (b) we do not believe it reasonably necessary to keep such information for any pending legal action, and (c) we are under no obligation to retain such information. Please be aware that any unfulfilled subscriptions may be canceled without refund and you will have to re-register in order to use the Service. It is your responsibility to request a refund from us or the appropriate merchant.

Information you provide to Company will be collected and stored in the United States. By providing personal information to Company, you hereby consent to such collection and storage.

**7.   _Chan_ g _es to this Polic_ y**

Company may amend this Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Service. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Website after such changes have been first posted.

**8.   _Questions or Concerns_**

If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy in connection with the Service, please send us a detailed message to [support@texture.com. ](mailto:support@texture.com)We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.
