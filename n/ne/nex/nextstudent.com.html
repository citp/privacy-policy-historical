                   If you  apply for a PLUS or Private loan on our site, we require that you provide  certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address,  phone number, Social Security number, and employer information.&nbsp; This information is necessary to process  your application and to contact you.&nbsp;  The applicant will receive a phone call within 15 min. of applying 9AM –  11PM Eastern Standard time and if are unable to be reached at provided phone  number they may receive a confirmation email.<br>

                    We do not collect any nonpublic personal information about you unless you  expressly authorize us to collect such information, such as when you submit a  loan application to us. This information may include your name, address,  telephone number, Social Security Number, and certain personal financial  information such as student loan account balances, payment history, account  usage and similar information relating to your transactions with NextStudent,  and is used only to facilitate the performance of our services.<br><br>

                      <span class="style3">Log Files </span><br>
                     <br>
                      As is true  of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in  log files.&nbsp; This information includes  internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider  (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream  data.&nbsp; <br><br>We use  this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends,  to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather  demographic information about our user base as a whole.&nbsp; We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable  information.&nbsp;<br><br>
                      <span class="style3">Cookies </span><br>
                      <br>A cookie  is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping  purposes.

                      <span class="style3">Supplementation of Information </span><br>
                      <br>In order to provide certain financial lending services to you, we may on  occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us with  information from third party sources.&nbsp;  These third parties include Hart, Terri, and ACS (Affiliated Computer  Services)<strong></strong> <br><br><ul><li><em>Credit Check</em><br><br>To determine if you qualify for one  of our loan products, we use your name and social security number to request a  credit report.&nbsp; Once we determine your  credit-worthiness, we store the information in an electronic database. </li><br><br><li><em>ID Loan  Verification</em><br><br>We use the National Student Loan Database to verify your  loan history in order to determine if you qualify for certain loan products.</li><li> <em>Enhancement of  Profile Information</em></li></ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        We purchase marketing  data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better  target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you  would be interested.&nbsp; To enrich our  Profiles of individual customers, we tie this information to the personally  identifiable information they have provided to us.<br>
        <br>        <span class="style3">Legal Disclaimer&nbsp; </span><br>
        <br>
        We reserve the right to  disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when  we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply  with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web  site.<br>
        <br>                   
        NextStudent  abides by federal law and the guidelines established by the Federal Trade  Commission regarding youth privacy. Therefore, we will not knowingly collect  any personal information from or allow the registration of young people under  the age of 13.

        <br>
        <br>
        NextStudent  will not share your personal information with nonaffiliated, third parties  except as required or permitted by federal law or regulation. For example, we  may share your personal information with schools, lenders, agencies of the  United States government and their agents, credit-reporting agencies, and with  third-party servicing organizations. These third parties are required to use  your personal information for its intended purpose only.                     
        <br>
        <br>
