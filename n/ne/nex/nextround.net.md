# NextRound.net | Level Off From Your Day Job

Maske and Booth created Nextround.net groups and content (herein, “NR”) with the intention of making it easy to share information with your friends, family and extended networks. We give you control of your information because we understand that you may not want to give the world access to the information you share on NR. Our privacy settings allow you to limit the information displayed about you to your group members.

We abide by two main beliefs when it comes to your privacy: (1) You should have control over your personal information. NR helps you share information with your friends, family and extended networks. You choose what information that you want others on the site to see, including personal information, pictures, etc. (2) You should have access to the information others want to share. Sharing information between group members is an essential part of fun interaction. We want to help you easily get that information in order to make interacting with your group members stress free.

**Personal Information (PI) Collection**

We collect personal information when you register with NR, when you use NR groups; when you visit NR groups or when you enter contests, promotions or sweepstakes. We may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

When you register with NR, you have the ability to provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address and any other personal or preference information that you opt to provide to us.

We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP addresses NR cookie information, and the page you request.

Information collected by NR when you participate in a contest, promotion or sweepstakes may include your full name, e-mail address, and street address.

When you use NR, you may specify group dynamics, set reminders, create votes, post messages, modify images, create agendas, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you posted or easily view photos you’ve uploaded. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.

**Age limitations**

The Service is not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any person under the age of 13.

**How Your Personal Information Is Used**

We take appropriate physical and electronic measures to protect against unauthorized access to, alteration of, and disclosure of Personal Information.

No Personal Information is collected during this process unless you explicitly provide it.

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies (log files) to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate, including usage and volume statistics related to site visits, amount of time spent on the site, web browsers used by users, and geographic location of visitors, etc. This information is used to help us better understand the needs of our customers.

We may use third party vendors and partners to assist us in providing our products or services and may transfer your Personal Information to such vendors who have entered into a contract with us that protects the confidentiality of your information and permits the vendor to use it only as necessary to fulfill its contract.

We may be required to disclose Personal Information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share Personal Information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law; to protect our interests or property; to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the NR service or using the NR name; or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.

If you post Personal Information in areas of the site accessible to other users, it is important that you understand and be aware that such information can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and as a result could be used improperly to send you unsolicited messages. Please note, we are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in these forums or for others’ misuse of such information. Any misuse or improper collection of information provided on NR is a violation of the NR Terms of Use and should be reported to us as abuse. To help ensure your personal information is protected, we strongly recommend against posting your email address and other such Personal Information unless you are comfortable with the possibility of receiving unwanted contact.

Group Captains are allowed to email and add members to a NR group. NR will only use invitee email addresses to send invitations, updates, notices, reminders and messages by members of the NR group. Once the invitee receives the invite and registers with NR, that individual is considered a NR member and may receive the same type of communication from NR according to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.

If you have been invited to participate in a NR group, and you do not want to receive messages from the group captain or other members of the group, you may simply remove yourself from the group. To do this modify your user preferences in “my settings”.
