## Use of Credit Reference Agency Information and sharing of credit information.

When you apply for credit we will make searches about you at credit reference agencies who will supply us with credit information, as well as information from the Electoral Register. The agencies will record a search which can be seen by you, Next and other lenders on your credit file, whether or not credit is granted. We may use credit scoring methods to assess your application and to verify your identity. If we agree to offer you credit online and, for any reason, you do not complete your online order after accepting the terms of the credit agreement, a Next Credit Account will not be created. Credit searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit references agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially, may be used by Next and other companies if credit decisions are made about you or other members of your household. This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your Next Credit Account. Information held about you by the credit reference agencies may already be linked to records relating to people with whom you are linked financially. For the purposes of credit searching you may be treated as financially linked and you will be assessed with reference to any ‘associated’ records. If we enter into a credit agreement with you we will also supply details of your agreement with us to the credit reference agencies, as well as on going details of your Next Credit Account and how you manage it. If you do not pay on time, or in full, we will advise the credit reference agencies who will record details of the debt. All this information will be seen by other organisations carrying out later searches. Adverse entries regarding the conduct of your account will remain on your credit file for up to six years. The credit reference agencies may also use the records for statistical analysis about credit, insurance and fraud. You have the right of access of your personal records held by credit reference agencies and we will supply their names and addresses upon request to the Data Protection Manager, Next Directory, Desford Road, Enderby, Leicester, LE19 4AT or email [dataprotection@next.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/web/20161229051632id_/http%3A//www.next.co.uk/%E2%80%9Cmailto:dataprotection@next.co.uk%E2%80%9D). We will make periodic searches of group records and credit reference agencies to manage your Next Credit Account, to take decisions regarding credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit. These searches will not be available to other lenders for credit assessment purposes. We may also use your information, including shopping habits to open and run your Next Credit Account, including payment recovery, fraud prevention, debt tracing and for our marketing. Some of the information you provide may be transferred outside the European Economic Area for processing.
