  2.  ********How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technology****



Like most websites and online services, we and certain of our third party providers may collect certain types of usage information automatically when you visit our websites, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, Flash cookies (locally stored objects), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, “tracking technologies”).  These tracking technologies collect information about how you use our websites (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take on our websites), information about your browser and online usage patterns (e.g., IP address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, pages viewed, whether you opened an email , links clicked), and information about the device(s) you use to access our websites (e.g., mobile device identifier, mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, and depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data (which could include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device), or we may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other information, like an IP address.  We, or our third party providers, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant content displayed on another device (which may include marketing information related to products or services that may be of interest to you)*, and so that we may recognize and contact you on the various devices you may use.  We may also collect analytics data, or use third party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage of the Services. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our visitors, the Services are not configured to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser.

We may use the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit our websites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including content (which may include marketing information related to products or services that may be of interest to you)*; (c) identify you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our websites and Services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our websites; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise to plan for and enhance our websites and Services.
