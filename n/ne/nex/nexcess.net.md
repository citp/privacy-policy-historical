# Privacy Policy | Nexcess

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy” or “PP”) has been developed by Nexcess.net, L.L.C. (“Nexcess”, “Us”, “We”, “Our”) to explain how we collect, retain, process, share and transfer your personal information when you use Nexcess’ products of services, visit our websites, or otherwise interact with us. This policy is meant to express Nexcess’ commitment to the privacy of our customers’ data, and to explain the means used for their privacy. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning attributed to them in Nexcess’ Terms of Service.

This policy also explains your choices about how we use information about you. Your choices include how you can object to certain uses of information about you and how you can access and update certain information about you.

#### How You Can Access, Update or Delete Your Data

To easily access, view, update, delete or port your personal data (where available), or to update your subscription preferences, please sign into the Customer Portal. If you make a request to delete your personal data and that data is necessary for the products or services you have purchased, the request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any Services purchased or required for Nexcess’ legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements.

If you are unable for any reason to access, update or delete your personal data within the Customer Portal, you may contact us by one of the methods described in the “Contact Us” section below.

#### How We Secure, Store and Retain Your Data

Nexcess follows generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal data we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. Nexcess strongly recommends that users configure SSL to prevent interception of data transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have requested and thereafter for a variety of legitimate legal or business purposes. These might include retention periods: 

  * mandated by law, contract or similar obligations applicable to our business operations;
  * for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights;
  * to allow Nexcess to offer you the opportunity to purchase additional or new services; or
  * needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.



If you have any questions about the security or retention of your personal data, you can contact us at legal@nexcess.net.

#### Legal Bases for Processing (for EEA Users)

If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Nexcess collects and processes information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. This means that Nexcess collects and uses your information only where: 

  * Nexcess needs it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support, personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;
  * It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect Nexcess’ legal rights and interests;
  * You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or 
  * We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.



If you have consented to Nexcess’ use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where Nexcess is using your information because we or a third party have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services. 

#### The E.U. – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework

Nexcess participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Nexcess is committed to subjecting all personal data received from the EU in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, according to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield list: https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.

Nexcess is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Nexcess complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Nexcess is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Nexcess may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted: https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint.

#### Use of Subprocessors

Nexcess may use processors and subprocessors (including personnel and resources) in locations worldwide to help Nexcess with its business activities in providing the Services, offering customers new or additional goods and services and sending emails. A list of subprocessors is available upon request. If Nexcess subcontracts the performance of any of the Services, Nexcess will be liable to you for the acts and omissions of Nexcess subcontractors as if they were the acts or omissions of Nexcess under the agreement governing the Services (subject to the limits and exclusions of liability).

#### Additional Information for End Users

If end users of a Nexcess customer have any questions or complaints concerning Nexcess’ processing of personal data on behalf of a Nexcess customer, they are invited to contact the Nexcess customer directly, or they may contact Nexcess at legal@nexcess.net.

This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection or use of your data by third party Add-Ons, and Nexcess urges you to consider the privacy policies governing third party Add-Ons.

#### Social Media Widgets

Nexcess’ website includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, links to our various social media pages and widgets, such as the “share this button” or interactive mini-programs that run on our website. These features may collect your IP address, which pages you are visiting on Nexcess’ website, and may set a cookie to enable said feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on Nexcess’ website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
