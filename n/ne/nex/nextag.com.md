# NexTag: Help [Privacy Policy]

NexTag respects your privacy and we want you to be confident in sharing your information with us. We've written the following statement to disclose any of the information we gather while you are using our site.

We do not share any identifiable information with any third party at any point in your relationship with us as a valuable customer without your permission.

We collect certain technical information to insure that our site is working properly. For example, when you are browsing, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to help administer our Web site.

Your IP address is also used at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our site. We may provide third parties with statistics about our users, traffic patterns and related site information. This data is collected from millions of user visits to our site each month and does not contain any personally identifiable information.

Cookies are used to help make your use of our site more enjoyable. NexTag creates these cookie files on your hard drive through your browser and uses them to save information on your NexTag username, zip code and site preferences so you can avoid re-entry of this information each time you visit our site. Cookies also help us to deliver content specific to your interests. You may decline our cookies if your web browser software permits, although this may prevent you from accessing certain features on our site.

**NexTag does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer.**

All credit card information is encrypted and, with the exception of our credit card processing service, is not shared with any third party at any time without your approval.

We take reasonable precautions to maintain the security of the personal information you provide to our site and to only share this information with third parties that agree to honor our privacy policy. In addition to standard firewall protection, we use Secure Socket Layers ("SSL") technology to protect this information.
