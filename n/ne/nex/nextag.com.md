Mortgage Users

> This section of the Privacy Policy applies specifically to Mortgage Users and the collection and use of information from Mortgage Users.

> **Information Collection and Sharing**
> 
> NexTag requests that Mortgage Users provide us with Mortgage User information on a questionnaire, which includes personal financial and contact information ("Mortgage User Information"). We request Mortgage User Information so as to enable NexTag to provide Mortgage Users with mortgage related services. We only disclose Mortgage User Information in compliance with applicable laws. In the questionnaire, we obtain authorization from a Mortgage User to disclose Mortgage User Information to participating banks, mortgage brokers, loan brokers, financial institutions, and in some cases aggregators (collectively, "Lenders") in the questionnaire and state that we cannot provide our mortgage-related services without such authorization. In the event a Mortgage User has provided its authorization to share Mortgage User Information with Lenders, NexTag does not have control over the use of such Mortgage User Information by the Lenders and the Mortgage User's rights regarding such use will be governed by the policies of the Lenders with whom the information is shared. After the Mortgage User has left our Site, we continue to treat Mortgage User Information as confidential and do not disclose it to third parties other than as authorized by the Mortgage User. We do not provide a means of updating Mortgage User Information. Any such updates should be provided directly to the Lenders that contact the Mortgage User.
> 
> **Confidentiality and Security**
> 
> We restrict access to Mortgage User Information to those NexTag employees and agents who need to know that information to provide better enable us to provide mortgage-related and other services to Mortgage Users.
> 
> We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your Mortgage User Information.
