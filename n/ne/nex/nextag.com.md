# NexTag: Help [Privacy Policy]

NexTag respects your privacy and we want you to be confident in sharing your information with us. We've written the following statement to disclose any of the information we gather while you are using our site.

  * We do not sell any identifiable information to any third party at any point in your relationship with us as a valuable customer.
  * We participate in the Council of Better Business Bureaus' BBBOnLine® Privacy Program, and comply with all the BBBOnLine Privacy standards. Further information about this program is available at [www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/).



We collect certain technical information to insure that our site is working properly. For example, when you are browsing, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to help administer our Web site.

Your IP address is also used at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our site.

Cookies are used to help keep track of your offers and items during your visit. NexTag creates these cookie files on your hard drive through your browser and uses them to save information on passwords and past purchases so you can use additional functionality on the site. Cookies also help us to deliver content specific to your interests. 

**NexTag does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer.**

The information we may request from you is outlined below. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us at [customerservice@nextag.com](mailto:customerservice@nextag.com?subject=Link%20from%20Help%20Section).

> **Zip Code:** In order to use all of the functionality on the site, (i.e. finding out total price with shipping) we ask you for some broad demographic information such as zip code. 
> 
> **Email Address:** When you decide to bid (send a price to a seller), we require that you register and provide us with your email address so that we can contact you with seller responses. 
> 
> **Basic Contact Info:** When a visitor decides to become a registered user, we ask for some basic contact information (i.e. first name and email address). We use this basic contact information to send the user information about our company and to communicate on the status of NexTag bids. We do not share this basic contact information with any third parties. 
> 
> **Complete Contact Info:** When a registered user decides to become a customer, we use the order form to collect complete contact information, i.e. full name, address and phone number as well as financial information, i.e. account and/or credit card number. Financial information that is collected is only used by NexTag to check the user's qualifications and to bill the user for products and services. 

**The use of customer information is limited to the following:**

  * To communicate with a user regarding order status, to contact the user in response to a customer service question from the user or to resolve a dispute between the user and another user.
  * To allow our sellers to contact our customers regarding their order.
  * To share NexTag-specific information.
  * To distribute occasional promotional material from our selling partners to our customers.



> We collect, store, and share customer information, encrypted credit card numbers, shipping and billing information. This information will only be used with branded retail merchants at the time that the buyer has agreed to make a purchase. At no time do we share your credit card information with sellers on the person-to-person exchange. When we do share your information with branded retail merchants, it is encrypted and delivered securely. For further listings of the participating branded retail merchants please refer to the "Participating Sellers" link on our homepage.
> 
> When customer information is passed to a branded retail merchant, that merchant is fully responsible for the management and the use of the information they receive as governed by their own privacy policies. For further information on how a particular merchant uses customer information, please contact that seller directly. NexTag does not otherwise share customer contact information with other third parties. 

**Our site contains links to other Web sites. NexTag is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.**
