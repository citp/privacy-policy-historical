# Privacy Policy – Nexway

INTRODUCTION

For your information, this introduction presents the various points covered in the below “Privacy Policy” section in a simplified and accessible way, in order to ensure a good understanding of all our customers.

This introduction can not replace the reading of the below ‘privacy policy’ section, which is complete and detailed and is the only document to legally bind the company NEXWAY.

**Information collected during the sale:**

When selling a product via the Nexway shopping cart, we collect the minimum necessary information (your first name, last name, address, as well as your e-mail address) in order to establish the proof of purchase and to fulfill our obligation.

This information is transmitted to the publisher or vendor operating your online store, in order to provide you with the purchased product (usually in the form of a product activation key or download link). Nexway and its partner contractually undertake to treat your data with respect for your privacy in accordance with the European directive called “GDPR” (also called “General Data Protection Regulations”). If the basket offers you to subscribe to an optional marketing product, your consent is then transmitted to Nexway’s partner. If the shopping cart does not offer an optional marketing product or if you have not chosen this option, then your e-mail will under no circumstances be used for marketing purposes (see below the marketing processing section).

These data can also be used in the context of aggregated and anonymous reporting on the activity of the online shop. This ratio is called “sales statistics” and allows for example to calculate the average basket of our customers (as for example: “The average basket of our customers is 49 euros or the average basket in Picardy Region is 53 euros”»). Your data will then have been used for the calculation of this statistic, but this counting does not imply any tracking on our part.

**Development of ‘PERSONA’:**

We use our customers’ data to create ‘persona’. The persona are fictional characters supposed to represent a part of our customers.

For example, if we know that 15% of our customers are women living in the city centre and 14% are single men living in peri-urban areas, our analysis teams will create two fictional characters: Julie and Valerian. These persona are work tools that allow product and marketing teams to develop product strategies accordingly. Your data can thus be used for the elaboration of such a persona but there is no specific identification of your person.

We inform you that you can at any time object to the processing of your data by writing to us at the following email address [dpo@nexway.com](mailto:dpo@nexway.com) or [customercare@nexway.com](mailto:customercare@nexway.com).

**Marketing Processing :**

If you have chosen to receive personalized information and offers by ticking the box provided for this purpose, we carry out algorithmic processing using your data to enable us to propose exclusive offers likely to interest you. You can decide to unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the link in the related e-mail.

**Geolocation for VAT or Cart language application purposes:**

When you use the Nexway shopping cart, your IP address is used to geolocate you for VAT purposes. Geolocation only concerns the application of VAT.  Geolocation data is stored for less than 72 hours and is accessible only through Nexway’s marketing algorithms. Unlike other treatments, it is not possible to oppose geolocation for VAT purposes because Nexway has the legal obligation to prevent fraud. The geolocation can also sometimes be carried out punctually during the connection in order to lead you towards the appropriate language.

In these two processes there is no storage of your geolocation information (except the VAT rate or the language used for your purchase). We do not store your position.

**Collection of your data by third parties:**

Nexway and the owner of the online store use third parties to analyze your navigation on the site on behalf of Nexway. The data collected and their processing by third parties are subject to the same rules of protection of your privacy as if they had been collected by Nexway directly. Third parties contractually commit to Nexway to respect the rules of protection of your data.

**Personal Accounts :**

Please note that in case Nexway provides you with access to a personal account, this can be synchronized with your personal account of the Partner site.

**Abandoned shopping cart :**

For service reasons, Nexway may save your unfinished shopping cart to allow you to complete your purchase later and send you an email allowing you to resume your purchase.  The data thus collected is kept out of reach of any marketing process. It is kept for a maximum period of 72 hours after which it is destroyed.

**Data retention :**

The data collected is stored securely at Nexway. Data retention periods differ according to the nature of the processing. For example, the accounting or legal department must keep proof of purchase for a period of 10 years in order to comply with anti-fraud laws. In contrast, the data retention period for a marketing algorithm for which you have consented to personalized offers is set at three years after your last purchase.

Please find below a table summarizing the retention periods of your data:

Type of treatment | Delay  
---|---  
Accounting or Legal | 10 years  
Marketing | 3 years after last purchase  
Geolocation | 72 hours  
Sales Statistics | 5 years  
Shopping Cart | 72 hours

  3. Protect and defend our rights or property, or those of visitors to the Store and Site and our customers, as well as third parties;

For tax-exempt orders from certain EU countries, your address may be forwarded to the relevant tax authorities to establish that your VAT identification number is correct.


  * _Commercial change_



In the event Nexway experiences a business change through a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part of its assets, your Personal Information may be among the transferred assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that the purchaser of Nexway or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy. You consent to Nexway sharing your Personal Information in these circumstances.

4/ Exporting and processing personal data outside the European Union Member States

We hereby declare that for the purposes of processing your order, your data may be transferred through us to our U.S.-based subsidiary or to Product suppliers that are established outside the European Union in countries that, to date, do not generally have a level of data confidentiality recognized as complying with European Union standards.

Please note that Nexway’s affiliates have entered into and signed International Personal Information Transfer Agreements, which allow your data to be processed in accordance with European Union regulations regarding the transfer of Personal Information to third countries.

5/ Data security and confidentiality

In order to maintain the highest level of consumer and customer protection, we adhere to the rules in force in our industry. We maintain commercially reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures and procedures to protect and secure your Personal Information during data collection, transmission and storage. Your data is only accessible to authorized persons who are familiar with Nexway’s data privacy policy. Please note, however, that no company can completely exclude the security risks associated with Personal Information.

6/ Transport Layer Security Protocol

All access to the Nexway Store order pages is made using Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology, which encrypts the Personal Information you provide during the order process. Thus, confidential data is protected from interception by third parties and your Personal Information is transferred through this secure channel. To ensure this level of security, our systems use a certificate that conforms to standard e-commerce practices. This certificate is issued by a trusted security provider. All standard Internet browsers are compatible with this technology and automatically accept certificates from trusted providers. However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

7/ Credit card data

Nexway is fully compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) to enhance payment card data security and provide a secure e-commerce environment for our customers. The PCI DSS establishes requirements for network architecture, software development, security management and other proactive measures essential to ensure the security of payment card transactions. Each year, a qualified security expert thoroughly reviews Nexway’s procedures to ensure our compliance with strict PCI regulations.

Thus, we only display the last four digits of your credit card number when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the entity responsible for processing the payment concerned when processing the order. In accordance with PCI DSS requirements, this transfer is secured according to the TLS standard.

8/ Correction and consultation of personal data

If you wish to review, correct, block or delete your stored Personal Information, please send us a brief request in writing, by post or by e-mail (see below). Upon request, we can tell you whether or not we have your Personal Information. In the event that, despite our efforts to maintain correct and up-to-date data, incorrect information has been saved, we will amend it at your request. You will usually receive a response from us within thirty (30) days after receiving your request.

9/ Data retention

Nexway will retain personal data that we process on behalf of our customers for as long as necessary to provide our services. Nexway will retain and use this Personal Information as necessary to fulfill legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our contracts.

Upon termination of your contractual relationship with Nexway and upon your request, your data (including Personal Information) will be permanently blocked in Nexway’s internal systems and then deleted at the end of the legally required retention periods (see table summarizing retention periods in the foregoing introduction section).

Please note that any deletion of your Personal Information applies only to data about you as an individual. Nexway shall in no event be liable for any termination of your account or deletion related to the deletion of your Personal Information or personal data.

With the exception of the particular case where a minor makes an online purchase from a bank account in his name and for which personal data is collected only for the purpose of proof of purchase.
