<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>

<p>We may use both “session” cookies  [and “persistent” cookies on the website.  We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit.</p>

<p>Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of our websites.  Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.  The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information.  Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.</p>

<p>Our advertisers/payment services providers may also send you cookies.</p>

<p>We publish Google Adsense interest-based advertisements on our website. These are tailored by Google to reflect your interests.
