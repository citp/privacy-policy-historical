# Privacy Policy

Nerdbusiness.com is a blog by me, Derrick Schwabe. Privacy is a fundamental human right and I definitely support our right to privacy online. And so I am especially committed to ensuring the privacy of anyone visiting my blog. 

This site does collect some information about its visitors. Here's why: 

#### Website traffic

This kind of data is cool! Plus, it's nice to know how many people are visiting. I use a third party service which helps to track how many people visited. The service may use a "cookie" to collect this information upon each visit and may also collect the following information but not limited to: page URL, page title, referring source, user agent, IP address, language, hardware platform, OS, and screen resolution. If you prefer not to have this information collected, you may opt-out simply by visiting nerdbusiness.com with cookies disabled (you can disable cookies in your internet browser settings). This information will never be shared with anyone else for any purpose. 

#### Feedback

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy feel free to [send a message](mailto:admin@nerdbusiness.com).

Respectfully,  
Derrick Schwabe
