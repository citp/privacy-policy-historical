The protection of personal information is very important to Nerium International™. Privacy protection is, and
always will be, critical to our business. Nerium International is committed to protecting the privacy and security
of individuals who visit Nerium International’s website(s). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you
about what information may be collected from you when visiting the site. It explains how such information will
be used by Nerium International and/or other persons or entities with whom such information may be shared.
It also explains your choices regarding the collection, use, and distribution of such information; your ability
to edit, update, correct, or delete such information; and the security procedures that we have implemented
to protect your privacy.
Collection of Information
When visiting a Nerium International website, you may be asked for certain types of personally identifiable
information, such as your first and last name, mailing address, city, state, ZIP code, telephone number, email
address, and credit-card number in connection with automatic deposit/debits, etc. This information allows us
to conduct our business, provide customer service, communicate offers on products that may be of interest
to you, and to fulfill your order. You may volunteer to disclose personally identifiable information to us. If you
do not want to disclose your personally identifiable information to us, please do not submit it. We may also
collect non-personally identifiable information from you when you visit the site, such as your IP address,
browser type, domain name, etc. This information is collected and analyzed in the aggregate in order to
improve the function and content of our website.
Use of Information
Nerium International uses the information that is collected about you for a variety of purposes, such as
processing, confirming, and fulfilling your order; providing your name to Nerium International Brand Partners
in connection with your potential interest in our products or opportunity; analyzing Brand Partner trends
and statistics; and enhancing the operation of the site. We may employ vendors to perform functions on our
behalf. Examples may include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, email administrative functions, processing
credit-card payments, and providing customer service. Nerium International vendors are under contractual
obligation to use confidential data only for those purposes for which they are hired. We may disclose the
information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact,
or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be causing injury to you, to us, or to others. We may
also disclose information when we believe the law requires it.
Protection of Children
The Nerium International website is not designed for or targeted at children. We do not knowingly collect,
use, or disseminate any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18. If, however,
we become aware that personally identifiable information regarding a child under the age of 18 has been
collected at the Nerium International site, we will use such information for the sole purpose of contacting
a parent or guardian of the child to obtain verifiable parental consent. If we cannot obtain consent after a
reasonable period of time, or if, when contacted, a parent or guardian requests that we do not use or maintain
such information, we will make reasonable efforts to delete it from our records. Upon request by a parent
or guardian, Nerium International will provide a description of the specific types of personal information
collected from a child who is under the age of 18.
