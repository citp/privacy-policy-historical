The protection of personal information is very important to Nerium™ International. Privacy protection is, and always will be, critical to our
business. Nerium International is committed to protecting the privacy and security of individuals who visit Nerium International web site(s). The
purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about what information may be collected from you when visiting the site. It explains how such

your choices regarding the collection, use, and distribution of such information, your ability to edit, update, correct or delete such information,

Collection of Information
When visiting a Nerium International web site, you may be asked for certain types of personally identifiable information, such as your first
and last name, mailing address, city, state, zip code, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card number in connection with automatic
deposit/debits, etc. This information allows us to conduct our business, provide customer service, communicate offers on products that may be
of interest to you, and to fulfill your order. You may volunteer to disclose personally identifiable information to us. If you do not want to disclose
your personally identifiable information to us, please do not submit it. We may also collect non-personally identifiable information from you
when you visit the site, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, etc. This information is collected and analyzed in the aggregate
in order to improve the function and content of our web site.
Use of Information
Nerium International uses the information that is collected about you for a variety of purposes, such as processing, confirming, and fulfilling
your order, providing your name to Nerium International Brand Partners in connection with your potential interest in our products or opportunity,
analyzing Brand Partner trends and statistics, and enhancing the operation of the site. We may employ vendors to perform functions on our
behalf. Examples may include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, e-mail administrative functions, processing credit card payments, and
providing customer service. Nerium International vendors are under contractual obligation to use confidential data only for those purposes for
which they are hired. We may disclose the information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify,
contact or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be causing injury to you, to us, or to others. We may also disclose information
when we believe the law requires it.

identifiable information from children under the age of 18. If, however, we become aware that personally identifiable information regarding a
child under the age of 18 has been collected at the Nerium International site, we will use such information for the sole purpose of contacting
a parent or guardian of the child to obtain verifiable parental consent. If we cannot obtain consent after a reasonable period of time, or if when
contacted, a parent or guardian requests that we do not use or maintain such information, we will make reasonable efforts to delete it from
our records. Upon request by a parent or guardian, Nerium International will provide a description of the specific types of personal information
collected from a child who is under the age of 18.
