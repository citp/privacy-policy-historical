We collect personal information like names, addresses and emails on a voluntary basis and only for functions that pertain to our content (i.e. post comments, contact forms and contests).

**Traffic Reports** :

Like all websites, we utilize log files and third-party providers like [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to collect and analyze traffic statistics using information like IP addresses, browsers,  ISPs, date of access, time spent on the site, pages accessed and links clicked. This information is not shared with anyone and does not contain any data that personally identifies the visitor. 

**Comments:**

Nerd Approved contains comments sections where readers can engage in a dialogue about our content. This service is provided through [Disqus](http://disqus.com/). For information on how your information is used, refer to the [Disqus Privacy Policy](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy). 

We try and actively monitor comments as much as possible, but this is no easy task and objectionable content might pop up from time to time. If alerted to a particular situation we will assess it and delete the offending comment if it is warranted.

**Contests**

Nerd Approved might request personal information from readers to fulfill requirements for contests. This may include shipping information, email and phone numbers. This information is not shared with anyone except the company sponsoring the contest for the purposes of shipping (please refer to the sponsor’s privacy policy for information on how they handle this information). 

Contests are generally handled through a [Rafflecopter](http://www.rafflecopter.com/) widget. Information is collected to identify participants, but is not used on our end for any reason other than to notify winners. When requested we may share Rafflecopter data with the contest sponsor to verify entries. Please refer to the [Rafflecopter Privacy Policy](http://www.rafflecopter.com/rafl/privacy/) for more on how they collect and use personal information. 

**Links to Other Websites:**

Nerd Approved may display links to other websites. Outside of the sites in our own network, we do not have any control over the contents of those sites.
