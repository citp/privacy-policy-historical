## Helpful information

At Npower Limited (“ **we** ”, “ **us** ” or “ **our** ” for short) we and our group companies are committed, not only to providing you with unbeatable value and an excellent service, but also to protecting your personal information.

Your personal information (also called ‘personal data’) is the information which identifies you as an individual that we get from you and others in various ways. Under the Data Protection Act 1998 (the **“Act”** ) specific obligations are placed on us in the way we handle this type of information and the aim of this privacy policy is to let you know what personal information we collect from you when you purchase products and services from us, when you use our website and when you contact us, how we store and use it, and how you can access and manage this information.

Your personal information may be stored online and therefore we take steps to ensure that our systems are well protected.

Please note that this privacy policy only covers [www.npower.com](http://www.npower.com/home/ "Click here to visit npower"). Other websites belonging to us (such as [www.npowerjobs.com](http://www.npowerjobs.com/ "Click here to visit npower jobs.") and [www.npowerjobs.com/graduates](http://www.npowerjobs.com/graduates "Click here to visit npower graduates.")) and other websites accessible via links are not covered by this policy. If you access any of these sites, please check the privacy policy applicable to these sites (if any) before you submit any of your personal information to them

### Our group and your products and services

Just so you know other than us, our group companies who may have access to your personal information under this privacy policy include:

Npower Commercial Gas Limited | Plus Shipping Services Limited  
---|---  
Npower Financial Services Limited | Superior Plumbing Installations Limited

### So, what personal information do we collect about you?

We collect the personal information requested by our application and contact forms together with any comments or remarks that you may provide in free text fields or may send to us. We may also keep a record of references received from third parties (for example from credit reference or fraud prevention agencies) and of any other correspondence or communication between you and us, whether written, e-mailed, or as a result of visits, interviews or recorded telephone calls.

Like most websites, we use "cookies" - small text files that are saved to your computer. More details about cookies, how we use them and how you can disable them can be found at [http://www.npower.com/home/about-npower/cookies/](https://web.archive.org/home/about-npower/cookies/).

We will (unless it's impractical) tell you, if we obtain and store information from any other source and also how we intend to use it in accordance with this privacy policy.

Whilst we take steps to protect user privacy, no data transmission over the internet can be entirely secure. We therefore do not guarantee the security of personal information that you send to us, or your use of the site. Any personal information you do send is at your own risk but once we receive it we use strict procedures to safeguard it.

### How do we use your personal information?

We will use the information you give us, or which we legally receive from another organisation or person, to set up and manage your gas or electricity account (or both) with us. We may share it with all relevant industry organisations based on agreed industry processes. We may use it and share it with any npower group company to:

  * help us identify you so we know who we are talking to;
  * supply you with gas or electricity (or both) or any other services that you request;
  * set up and otherwise manage your account, including collecting debts and improving our service to you;
  * work out your bills;
  * help prevent and detect fraud or loss;
  * assess risk, carry out marketing (unless you have opted out) or market research, statistical analysis, test systems, improve the way that we run your accounts (including quality assurance) and analyse your account history; and
  * train staff and monitor our services. This may mean that we record our conversations or our correspondence with you to make sure we are providing you with a good service and to make sure we keep to our legal and regulatory obligations.



If you have a meter installed at your property that can be connected to the wireless network (a ‘smart’ meter), we will gather information about the gas or electricity (or both) you use remotely and in real time (the equipment will automatically send us the information). We may use this information for the purposes set out above.

We may pass information about you to our agents and service providers for these purposes. This may involve passing your information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries that do not have the same data protection standards as we do in the UK. If we, or our agents and service providers, do this, we will make sure that it happens with the relevant legal protection in place. If we are asked, we may pass your information on for regulatory purposes to Ofgem (or any organisation which takes over Ofgem’s role), or as part of a government data-sharing initiative.

We may search the files of credit-reference agencies who will record the search. We may share information about how you deal with your account with other financial institutions, with credit-reference agencies and with fraud-prevention agencies. We may use this information to help us assess your ability to pay our bills and to make decisions about the products and services that we offer you.

We may use and record information about you or a member of your household. We may pass this information to social services, or to other organisations such as Help the Aged if you are in danger of being cut off and we believe you may need extra help. You or a member of your household may need this extra help as a result of your (or their) health, age, disability or financial circumstances.

If you have given us your mobile phone number or email address (or both), we may use the information to send you service messages or other similar information (by text message or email). The aim is to help us manage your account. We will not use the information for marketing purposes unless you have agreed that we can. You must let us know if your mobile phone number or email address changes so that we can keep this information up to date.

We will release your account details to any organisation we may transfer our rights or responsibilities to and we reserve the right to tell your future service provider of any debt you may have with us.

If you take a product through Homeserve, we may pass your details to Homeserve Membership Ltd. They may contact you and use your information (and pass it on to their service providers and their own group of companies), to help manage your policy, and for training and statistical analysis.

Please note that we reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with any applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate our systems properly, to protect both ourselves and our users, and where we are approached by a potential buyer of our business or assets, or in relation to any joint venture or business arrangement.

### If you have consented to us sending you marketing material...

...you may opt out at a later date. You have a right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes or giving your information to other members of our group for marketing purposes.

If you no longer wish to be contacted for marketing purposes please get in touch with us. Or if you have an online account, you can change your consent preferences in your account settings.

### How can you find out what personal information we hold about you?

Just ask us! You are entitled to see the personal information that we hold about you at any time. (If you write to, email or phone us and ask to see this information, it is known as a ‘subject access request’ or ‘SAR’ for short) You can do so by:

  * telephoning us on 0800 073 3000 (free from most landlines) or 0330 100 3000 (included in any 'inclusive minutes' from mobiles);
  * Contacting us through npower.com – [Contact Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/home/help-and-support/contact-us/) and choose the “Other” option; or
  * writing to us at Data Protection SARs Team, npower, Rainton House, Hougton-Le-Spring, Cygnet Way, Sunderland, DH4 5QZ.



When we receive your request we will send you a form to fill in and you will have to pay a fee of £10. If you do not return the form or pay the £10 fee, we will not be able to deal with your request.

Even if you don’t want a copy of your personal information, you can still contact us to check that the personal information that we hold is accurate, or to let us know of any changes to your personal information. We always try to ensure that the information that we hold is accurate, up to date and relevant. We’ll be more than happy to make changes or to correct any inaccuracies.
