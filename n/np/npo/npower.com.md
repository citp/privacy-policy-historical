# Privacy policy | About us | npower

We can only use your personal information where that is permitted by data protection laws. Those laws require that where we use your personal information we must satisfy one condition (legal basis) for processing. The legal bases are consent, to comply with our legal obligations, to perform a contract, if it’s in our legitimate interests and for special category data (health) it is in your vital interests.

Set out below are the different legal bases and the types of processing we carry out:

### Legal basis for processing

#### Consent

Where you have provided consent we will rely on that to process your information for the purposes set out at the time that the request for consent was made.

You can change that consent at any time (either by withdrawing it or giving your consent where you previously hadn’t). The consequence of withdrawing your consent might be that we are no longer able to do certain things for you.

See the section on “Your rights relating to the personal information we hold about you” then “Right to withdraw consent”.

#### Processing activities (purposes)

##### Cookies

We use cookies on our website/App to collect information about the device you use to access our website or App or sometimes third parties collect that on our behalf.

You are asked to do this before using our website/App. If you refuse consent or you later remove it you may affect our ability to provide the services you want.

See our [cookie policy](https://web.archive.org/about-npower/cookies/) for more information.

##### Marketing

To provide you with marketing information (including by phone, text message, email, via your online account and via your Smart in home display) about products and services (including third party products and services) which we think may benefit you in your everyday lives (if you have agreed to receive such information).We ask for consent when you sign up with us but you can change your mind at any time.

##### Market research

We may ask you to participate in market research (such as surveys, participation in focus groups etc.) to help improve the way we provide our services and products that we are able to make available to you – if you agree your feedback is given with your consent.  


##### Smart meter half hourly energy use

If you have a Smart meter installed at your property, we will only collect details of your half-hourly energy usage if you have given us your consent to do so.  


##### You agree to the disclosure

If you request us to disclose your personal data to other people or organisations such as to a relative to deal with your account on your behalf or to a person or organisation who has agreed to pay your bills or to company dealing with a claim on your behalf or you otherwise agree to such disclosures (for example to a charity providing you with debt assistance).

When we process any special categories of personal information at your request (e.g. your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation).

##### Priority Services

If you elect to either go on our Priority Services Register (which is a set of services that may be available to you or to people who may be living with you where, due to your (or their) health, age or some temporary reason (for example a bereavement) additional assistance may be required) or you agree for us to record details of your health etc. (information about your circumstances) we need your consent to do so.

If you consent we will use that information to assist us in providing the priority services you have requested (if any), managing your account so we are aware you may need additional help and support (for example having a bespoke debt pathway), for internal performance review, analysis, reporting and audit purposes (both internally and to report to Ofgem) to ensure our compliance with our obligations and to improve our services to you. We may share your information about your circumstances with with agents and service providers (like metering companies) who carry out services on our behalf.

If you agree we may also share your information with energy distributors and transporters (who may then share that information with water companies in line with agreed industry processes) so they can tailor their services to help you e.g. if there is a loss of power or water supply.

### Legal basis for processing

#### Vital interests

We may need to share information about your circumstances with third parties because we believe you or someone else’s life is in imminent danger.

This will be assessed on an individual basis and we will not share information unless we really believe there is a serious risk.

#### Processing activity (purposes)

Whether or not you are registered on PSR referred to above if you are in danger of being cut off and we believe you may need extra help we may record information about your circumstances.

You or a member of your household may need this extra help as a result of your (or their) health, age, disability or financial circumstances (we assess and record who may require extra help as a result of their circumstances) to assist you or them and ensure you or they stay on supply.  


### Legal basis for processing
