## Our legal bases for processing your data

Under data protection law, we need a lawful basis to collect and use your personal data. The law allows for six ways to process personal data. All of these are relevant to the types of processing that we carry out. This includes information that is processed on the basis of:

  1. a person’s consent (for example, if you consent to receive our e-newsletter)
  2. a contractual relationship (for example, to provide you with goods or services that you have purchased from us, such as a ticket or Membership)
  3. complying with a legal obligation (for example to process a Gift Aid declaration, or carrying out due diligence on large donations)
  4. the Gallery’s public functions as defined by DCMS (for example, in maintaining and providing access to our collections)
  5. protecting an individual’s vital interests (for example, to ensure the safety of staff and visitors to the Gallery)
  6. the legitimate interests of the Gallery, you as an individual, or wider benefits to society (please see below for more information)



Personal data may be legally collected and used if it is necessary for a legitimate interest of the organisation using the data, if its use is fair, and if it does not adversely impact the rights and freedoms of the individual concerned.

When we use your personal information, we will always consider if it is fair and balanced to do so and if it is within your reasonable expectations. We will balance your rights and our legitimate interests to ensure that we use your personal information responsibly and in ways that are not unduly intrusive or unfair.

If you would like more information on our use of legitimate interests, or to change our use of your personal data in this manner, please get in touch with us by contacting our Data Protection Officer at [**[email  protected]**](https://www.npg.org.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#286c78676846584f06475a4f065d43).

We want to ensure you remain in control of your personal data and that you understand your legal rights, which are:

  * the right to know whether we hold your personal data and, if we do so, to be sent a copy of the personal data that we hold about you (a ‘Subject Access Request’/SAR) within one month;
  * the right to have inaccurate or incomplete personal data updated or amended;
  * the right to have your personal data erased (though this will not apply where it is necessary for us to continue to use the data for a lawful or legitimate reason); and
  * the right to object to your personal data being used for marketing or profiling.



There are some exceptions to the rights above and, although we will always try to respond to any instructions you give us about our handling of your personal information, there may be situations where we are unable to meet your requirements in full.

If you would like further information on your rights or wish to exercise them, please contact our Data Protection Officer (details below).

It is important that the information we hold about you is accurate, therefore please let us know of any changes to the personal information you give to us. Please also get in touch if you wish to know what personal information we hold about you or how we process your information. This is your right of access and is known as a Subject Access Request (SAR). To submit a SAR you can contact us by email at [**[email  protected]**](https://www.npg.org.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3175617e715f41561f5e43561f445a), or write to us at Data Protection Officer, National Portrait Gallery, St Martin’s Place, London, WC2H 0HE.

## Supporter research and analysis

We would like to meet with or deepen our connection with individuals and organisations who might have an interest in our work. We are committed to nurturing collaborative relationships with donors, influencers, prospective donors and others so that together we can grow and sustain the Gallery for generations to come. 

We may use the information you provide to us in combination with publicly available information to help us find and connect with people with a passion for art, history or creative education projects, and the interest and ability to support us in new and exciting ways, if we consider it within our legitimate interests to do so.

We will use information that is already in the public domain (information that has been published in print or online) for the purpose of identifying high net worth individuals who may be interested in supporting our work with a major gift. These publicly available sources of information include Companies House, the electoral register, the phone book, the Charity Commission’s Register of Charities, Who’s Who, LinkedIn, company annual reports, and articles in newspapers and magazines. We do not use publicly available sources which we consider would be intrusive for this purpose, such as Facebook, Twitter, JustGiving, the Land Registry, online planning applications, or similar websites. We also carry out research to identify existing supporters who may be able to join our major donor programme. This is based both on publicly available information and information our supporters have given us directly, (e.g. where they live, who they bank with, what their occupation is and their age).

Occasionally we use a third party processor, Search & Prosper, to carry out this research on our behalf. To do this, we will share your name with this company and they will provide us with the publicly available information about you that their research has found. A copy of Search & Prosper’s Privacy Policy can be found [**here**](https://www.npg.org.uk/assets/files/pdf/policy/Search_Prosper_Privacy_Policy.pdf).

We may use profiling and database segmentation techniques to analyse your personal information and create a profile of your interests, preferences and ability to donate. This allows us to ensure communications are relevant and timely, to provide an improved experience for our supporters. It also helps us understand our supporters so that we can make appropriate requests to those who may be willing and able to donate more than they already do, or leave a gift in their will. This enables us to raise funds in the most cost-effective and least intrusive way.

Under data protection legislation, you have the right to object to your data being processed in this way. If you wish to ask not to be identified as a high net worth individual, or to review or amend your personal data, please contact [**[email  protected]**](https://www.npg.org.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#422f2330232f022c32256c2d30256c3729).
