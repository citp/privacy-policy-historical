ARTICLE 4: OPERATION OF THE NPERF TEST 4.1. Speed measurement

The speed test is based on the downloading of incompressible data with one or more simultaneous connections in order to saturate the User's connection for a few seconds in order to measure its capacity. The peak speed corresponds to the average of the highest 30% of the consecutive samples (50% for the upload rate). The average speed rate is calculated after discarding the lowest 5% and highest 5% of the samples.

4.2. Measurement of latency

The latency test consists of measuring the time it takes for a small data packet to reach the server and then return to your terminal. It is carried out ten times minimum. The result is a minimum, an average and jitter (maximum variation between measurements).

4.3. Performance in navigation

The navigation test consists of loading different websites and measuring the loading time. The performance index is obtained from the loading time.

4.4. Video performance (streaming test)

The video streaming test involves loading and playing a streaming video and measuring the loading time and any buffering (video pause) of the video. The performance index is the ratio of the video's loading and playing time to its nominal duration.

4.5. Score calculation

The final score is calculated from the results of the various tests listed above, in order to provide a global indicator of the user experience, using an exclusive NPERF algorithm. 

ARTICLE 5: ACCESS TO SERVICES - CREATION OF A USER ACCOUNT

4\. On what legal basis is my personal data processed?

The processing of your personal data is justified on different grounds (legal basis) depending on the use we make of the personal data. You will find below the legal bases we apply to our main procedures.

Among the applicable legal bases:

The contract:  
The processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfilment of the contract (provision of our testing services) to which you have agreed by validating the Terms of Use when using our applications.

The consent :  
You accept the processing of your personal data by express consent (checkbox, click, etc.). Thus, the processing of your location data is based on your consent.

The legitimate interest :   
nPerf has a legitimate interest in processing your data (selling technical data to its business customers, fixed and mobile network telecom operators) which is justified, balanced and does not undermine your privacy [See below, rights of individuals]. When using our applications, your IP addresses are collected to protect our computer systems against fraud or cyber-attacks. 

5\. Who are the recipients of your personal data?

The following are likely to have access to your personal data:

  * Some nPerf technical department staff filter your data before sending it to nPerf business customers. 

Your personal data may be transmitted to the service providers (subcontractors) that nPerf relies on for the performance of its activities to:

    * Host nPerf data on servers exclusively based in France.
    * Manage nPerf user accounts (subcontractor based outside the European Economic Area).
    * Manage certain functions of nPerf applications (subcontractor based outside the European Economic Area).

Your personal data may also be transmitted to nPerf business customers :

    * Fixed and mobile Telephone Operators.
    * Telecom partners
    * Private companies
    * Public institutions

nPerf sells this collected data to fixed and mobile network telecom operators through service agreements, so that they can evaluate themselves against the competition and improve the performance of their networks.

Your collected IP addresses may thus be communicated to these business customers on an express condition that these IP addresses are only used by them for the exclusive purpose of technical diagnostics, to the exclusion of any other purpose (particularly marketing or sales purposes).

6\. How long do we keep your personal data?

The retention period for your personal data varies depending on why it is processed:

    * Your nPerf account details are kept until the end date of your user account (more precisely 7 days later, the time to completely erase account data).
    * Your IP address and other technical data collected during your tests on nPerf applications are kept for five (5) years following their collection and will be then anonymized.
7\. What are your rights in respect of your personal data?

In accordance with the regulations in force, you have the following rights in respect of your personal data:

7.1 Right of access and communication

You have the right to know whether personal data concerning you is processed by nPerf and, if so, to obtain a copy in an understandable format.

In order to respond to your request, we are legally required to verify your identity. We may also be required to ask you to provide us with more information in order to respond to your request. 

7.2 Right of correction and deletion

You have the right to have your inaccurate data corrected and your incomplete data completed, as well as to obtain, in accordance with the regulations in force, the deletion of your personal data. 

7.3. Right to restrict processing

You have the right to temporarily suspend the partial or total use of your personal data.

This is the right to have processing suspended while an audit can take place in the cases provided for by the regulations (thus to check the accuracy of the data, to check whether the legitimate reasons pursued by the data controller prevail over those invoked by the person concerned in case of opposition etc.).

7.4 Right to object

You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your Personal Data having as legal basis the legitimate interest of nPerf, as well as the right to oppose the processing of your personal data for commercial prospecting purposes. 

7.5. Right to portability

You also have the right to the portability of your data, that is to say the right to receive the personal data that you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and the right to transmit this data to another data controller.

This right only applies to data collected with your agreement or under a contract.

7.6. Guidelines in case of death

You have the right to set general or specific guidelines regarding the fate of your personal data after your death

You may change or revoke these instructions at any time.

7.7. Exercise of rights

You can exercise your rights by mail by writing to us at nPerf, 87, rue de Sèze, 69006 LYON, France or send us your request via [this form](https://www.nperf.com/contact/).

8\. Is your personal data transmitted outside the European Union?

Some of our subcontractors are established outside the European Economic Area, and in a country not recognised by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection, and are likely to have access to some of your personal data. nPerf ensures that this transfer is carried out in compliance with the applicable regulations and guarantees a sufficient level of protection of your personal data (in particular, on a case-by-case basis, by the regularisation of contractual clauses based on the European Commission's model, or any other mechanism that complies with the regulations on the protection of personal data, the "Privacy Shield" in the USA).

9\. Security of your personal data

nPerf undertakes to take all necessary measures, in view of the nature of the data and the risks associated with their processing, to protect the security of your personal data and, in particular, to prevent their corruption, damage, or use by unauthorised third parties.  
For example, nPerf uses physical, electronic and administrative security measures.   
Our safeguards include firewalls, physical access controls, and data access authorisation checks.
