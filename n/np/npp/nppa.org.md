# NPPA Privacy Policy | NPPA

Aggregate information about visitor statistics is used to detect abuse of our site, to tune our server configuration, to refine navigation links, and to set prices for online advertisers.

  **Contact information collected through our website is used in connection with the purpose for which it was submitted** (for example, to answer a question, or to inform you of upcoming deadlines for a contest for which you have registered). 

In addition, we periodically contact our members by email to keep them informed about what is going on in the organization. 

We may also use the information we collect to customize our contacts with you and to do other internal analyses, such as market research, that will allow us to better meet the needs of our members. 

#### Public Information 

Some information on the site (such as the Forum discussions or the Find a Photographer listings) is viewable by any visitor to the site. This follows from the function of these areas: _the Find a Photographer service is only useful if prospective clients can in fact find you; and a discussion forum is only useful if other people can read what you write_. 

By listing your contact information in one of those areas, you accept that people may contact you as a result. (Note that forum postings do not generally include contact information, and we do not request or recommend that you provide such information in your posts.) 

In addition, contact information for staff members, officers, event chairs, and committee members are listed on the appropriate pages, so that members and attendees can reach them with questions. Volunteers and officers choose what information they want to have listed, but they must be reachable. 

#### Members-Only Information 

An additional tier of information (directory listings, contact information for the Mentorship program, and contact information for jobs posted on the Job Information Bank or Student Internship Guide) is available to any logged-in member of the organization. In all these cases, _sharing your information with other members is either your goal in using the service, or a necessary means to achieving that goal_ : nobody can apply for your job if they can't contact you. 

This information is only shared if you choose to make it available, and is only shared within the context you provided it for. 

#### Event, Contest, and Regional Information 

Information about participants in NPPA events and contests may be provided to the registrar and relevant (sub)committee chair, for administrative purposes. 

In addition, contact information for members in each NPPA region may be provided to the Regional Director and Associate Director, for use in outreach and other NPPA business.

#### Private Information

All other information you may provide is considered private and will not be shared, except as required by law.
