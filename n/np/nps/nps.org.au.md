# Privacy policy: NPS - Better choices, Better health

**This policy was updated 18 October 2010.**  


This document sets out the types of personal information held by National Prescribing Service Limited (NPS) (ABN 61 082 034 393) and how NPS collects, holds, uses and discloses that information as part of our business to provide independent, evidence-based information and services to health professionals, the community and individuals on the quality use of medicines and medical tests.

NPS is bound by the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and relevant state and territory privacy legislation.

## What is personal information?

Personal information is any information that identifies you or from which your identity could be reasonably ascertained. The types of personal information that NPS collects will vary depending on your relationship with us.  


## How types of personal information is collected?

The personal information that NPS collects could include your name, age, gender, the organisation you work for, your postal address, telephone and fax numbers and your email address.  


### Health professionals

If you are a health professional or health professional student, we may also collect details of your:  


  * occupation
  * membership of professional associations
  * provider and/or prescriber number, and
  * professional interests,



In order to:  


  * provide the appropriate services to you
  * conduct research and evaluation programs, or
  * report your participation to bodies managing the educational, continuous professional development or quality improvement programs in which you participate.



### Suppliers

If you are one of our suppliers or provide services to us, we may collect other information about you that we feel is necessary, such as the nature of the products and services that you provide, quotes that you provide and your direct credit details.  


### Sensitive information

NPS may collect sensitive information–such as health information and information about personal attributes such as ethnic or racial origin–when it relates to the provision of a service or its evaluation.  Where you request the provision of specific information relating to health conditions (for example by contacting NPS’ phone line services or requesting educational material), this may result in NPS collecting health information about you. NPS will only collect this information with your consent or otherwise in accordance with the National Privacy Principles and relevant privacy legislation.  


### Use of de-identified health information

As part of its services, NPS offers health professionals the opportunity to undertake quality assurance activities that require them to collect health information about individuals and disclose it to NPS on a de-identified basis for quality assurance purposes.

Health professionals providing de-identified data are advised what it will be used for and give NPS written consent for the data to be aggregated in feedback material provided to other health professionals or professional bodies.  This aggregated de-identified data may also be used in NPS evaluation studies and reports.

Data submitted to NPS is first encrypted using PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) encryption and then transmitted via a secure protocol so that NPS is unable to identify the individual the subject of the data.  


### Consequences of not providing information

In some instances if all necessary personal information is not provided, NPS may be unable to assess or process your information or provide you with the programs, services, materials or products you require.  


## How is personal information collected?

### On provision of information to us

NPS primarily collects information about you when you use or request a product or service, complete a survey, questionnaire or enrolment form or when you communicate with NPS by email, telephone, in writing or in person. NPS also collects information about you if you are providing services to NPS or, if you apply for employment at NPS, through the staff recruitment and selection process.  


### From publicly available sources

NPS also collects personal information from the public domain, for example from professional registration boards.  


### Indirect collection

NPS tries to collect personal information about an individual only from that individual, but in some circumstances NPS may obtain personal information from a third party, such as an NPS Facilitator, general practice manager, your health professional, a member of your family, a friend or your carer. If you provide personal information about another person to NPS, we require that you inform that person you have done so.

## Customers of our phone line services

NPS operates two phone line services:

  * Adverse Medicine Events Line (AME) for consumers wishing to report adverse experiences with their medicines. This service is currently provided by the Mater Misercordiae Health Services Brisbane Limited (the “Mater”).

This information may include:  


  * the relationship the caller has to the patient or person they are calling on behalf of and whether or not consent for making the call has been given. NPS also requires those calling on behalf of someone else and providing personal information about them to inform the patient or person that they have done so

De-identified information may be forwarded to the TGA for assessment and contribution to national medicine safety efforts.
