## 6\. Website advertising

NPS MedicineWise does not allow advertising on our website.   


## 7\. What types of personal information do we collect and why?

### 7.1. Types of information

The types of personal information that we collect will vary depending on your relationship with us. Sometimes we may need to collect sensitive information about you such as medical history of the consumer. Please note that we try and collect only the information that we need for a particular function and only hold it for as long as it remains necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. We only disclose your personal information (including sensitive information) for the purposes for which you gave it to us or for directly related purposes you would expect or if you agree.

### 7.2. We may use your personal information to:

  * conduct evaluations of our products, materials, programs and services;  

  * assist us in conducting or participating in pilot programs;  

  * invite you to participate in research or to inform you of our educational programs;  

  * subject to consent, create individual health stories which are published and/or broadcast to promote the quality use of medicines and/or medical tests and record the background information concerning the subject of the health story (including the individual's consent to appear in the same);  

  * promote educational activities including events and conferences;  

  * contact individuals for feedback on products, materials, programs and services; and  

  * assist us to perform our corporate and contractual obligations.  




### 7.3. Use of de-identified information

  * As part of its services, NPS MedicineWise offers health professionals the opportunity to undertake quality assurance activities that require them to collect health information about individuals and disclose it to NPS MedicineWise on a de-identified basis for quality assurance purposes.  

  * Health professionals providing de-identified data are advised what it will be used for and give us written consent for the data to be aggregated in feedback material provided to other health professionals or professional bodies. This aggregated de-identified data may also be used in our evaluation studies and reports.  

  * Data submitted to us is first encrypted using PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) encryption and then transmitted via a secure protocol so that we are unable to identify the individual who is the subject of the data.  




### 7.4. Use of images

  * NPS MedicineWise will seek your consent prior to any taking of a photo/image and the use (i.e. the publication) of the photo/image.  

  * In some cases that consent may be implied, for example, the taking of photos at functions to be used in publications.  

  * If the photo or image contains sensitive information about a person (for example, information relating to their health), we will obtain the relevant person's consent to take the photo/image and specify the uses to which it may be put.  

  * This consent should be informed and freely given and signed by the individual whose information is to be collected and disclosed.  

  * Child protection legislation requires that where the photo or image is that of a child, the child's parent or guardian must give permission.  

  * Where the person under 18 years is sufficiently mature to consent on their own behalf, that person's consent should also be obtained.  

  * Under the Privacy Act consents can be revoked at any time. If this occurs we will take all reasonable steps to cease using the image or photo from the time the consent is withdrawn.  




## 8\. How do we hold personal information?

NPS MedicineWise holds personal information on databases, electronic and hard copy files.  


## 9\. Who do we disclose personal information to?

Personal information held by NPS MedicineWise is disclosed by us in accordance with the Privacy Act.

### 9.1. Information collected during a call to our phone line services

  * In some circumstances, we may recommend that a call made to our phone line services be transferred to another health information line for specialist advice. We will only transfer the call to another service provider and provide the caller's personal information to that service provider with the caller's consent.  

  * We will disclose your personal information collected during a call to our Adverse Medicine Events Line to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) with your consent (or the consent of your authorised representative–parent or guardian). If you do not consent to us disclosing your personal information to the TGA, we will provide a de-identified report to the TGA which will not include your name, address or contact information.  




### 9.2. Educational activities provided to health professionals and students

  * Where NPS MedicineWise provides or administers education or participation activities for health professionals or health professional students, we may disclose personal information to relevant institutions for the purposes of monitoring the participation and use (against course or institution requirements) and to professional associations for the purpose of recording continuing professional development points.  

  * In some cases, information on the education or participation activity status of health professionals within a practice is provided to a practice manager of that practice.

Personal information incorporated into health stories may be disclosed to the general public when the health story is published and/or broadcast. The information disclosed in these circumstances would not include an individual's address, phone number, email address or other contact details.

  * You also have a right to request that we correct information held by us that you consider is not accurate, complete or up-to-date. If we make a correction and have disclosed the incorrect information to others, you can ask us to tell them about the correction. We must do so unless there is a valid reason not to.
