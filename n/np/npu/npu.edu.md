  **HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS**  
Currently, our web servers do not recognize or respond to “Do Not Track” signals. Our website may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. 

  **CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**  
NPU's website is not intended for children under the age of 13 and there are no areas specifically set aside for children under age 13.

We keep your personal information for as long as we think is necessary or advisable, and we reserve the right to retain it to the full extent not prohibited by law. If you are an applicant or student, you may also review your personal information that is readily accessible or request that it be updated by contacting Student Services.

**SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
We use various physical, electronic, and procedural measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. However, because no data security systems are completely secure, we do not warrant that any personal information that you provide to us will be secure or safe from unauthorized access. If you provide any personal information to us, you do so at your own risk. 

**LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES**  
For your information and convenience, our website may contain links to websites operated by third parties.

Each of these linked websites may maintain its own policies about the collection, use, and protection of your personal information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of such third parties to learn about their information practices and security measures.
