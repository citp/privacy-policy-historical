Information Collection and Use

** _

Registration

_

In order to become a Member, participate in surveys and access certain portions of this website, you must first complete our Member registration process. Our registration process requires you to give us contact information (e.g. email address) and demographic information (e.g.zip/postal code, birth date, or income level), and may also require that you provide us with information concerning other relevant topics (like how you became aware of NPD, and your computer type and Web usage). Your contact information is used to send you a welcoming email once you have registered, to notify you when there is a new survey available for you or to communicate Member news (for example, Sweepstakes Winners, birthday wishes). You may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see "Choice/Opt-Out" below. Demographic and other profile data is used only for statistical and classification purposes in aggregated or summary form and will NEVER be shared or sold on an individual basis. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users that are under the age of 13.

_

Member Surveys

_

Our Members have the opportunity to participate in surveys on our website and through emails sent to them by NPD. These surveys collect a wide variety of information on a virtually unlimited range of current topics. Your participation in a survey is always voluntary, and you therefore have a choice as to whether or not to provide the requested information. You should be aware, however, that once you have submitted survey responses to NPD, those responses cannot be recalled or altered and will be aggregated or summarized with the data that we obtain from other Members. The information collected through NPD’s surveys is used only for statistical and classification purposes in aggregated or summary form and will NEVER be shared or sold on an individual basis. The information we collect is stored and processed in our processing facility, which is currently located in New York, U.S.A.

_

Sweepstakes and Rewards

_

From time to time NPD may offer you the opportunity to enter into a sweepstakes for a chance to win cash or gift prizes. By responding to a survey which includes a sweepstakes offer, or by mailing in a sweepstakes entry, you agree to let NPD share your contact information (e-mail address) with an independent third-party sweepstakes administrator. Your contact information is used by the administrator for the sole purpose of letting you know if you won a sweepstakes. To receive your prize, you will be required to submit to the administrator certain information (e.g. name and mailing address). This information is used for the sole purpose of mailing you your prize. When claiming prizes, winners also complete an online affidavit, which gives NPD permission to post winners names and state or country of residence, to let other NPDOR Members know they won.

On occasion NPD may offer you the opportunity to claim cash rewards for completed surveys. To receive your reward, you may be required to submit certain information to NPD (e.g. name and mailing address). This information will be shared with an independent third-party administrator for the sole purpose of mailing you your reward.

Refer A Friend

_

If a Member elects to use our referral service for informing friends about our website, we ask them to provide their name and the names and email addresses of the friends they would like to notify. Upon the Member’s submission of this information to NPD, NPD automatically sends an email to each of the friends from the Member. The friends’ names and contact information are not retained by NPD or used for any other reason.

These cookies contain absolutely no personal and confidential information. A user of this website may reject or delete our cookie and still use the website, but their use of the site will be restricted.

Sharing

**

NPD aggregates the information it collects from its surveys and uses that aggregated information in its business, which includes sharing such aggregated information with its customers, affiliates, partners, and others. Because the information is aggregated, the data you provide to us is not personally identifiable to you.

In some instances, we may conduct our business through, or with the assistance of or in cooperation with, one or more of our affiliates. This may require that we provide survey information and in some cases personally identifiable information (e.g.: email address) to the applicable NPD affiliate. In the event that we do so, however, we will take steps to ensure that the NPD affiliate handles the information in a manner aligned with the privacy principles described in this privacy statement

We use an independent third party administrator to administer our sweepstakes. The only information that is shared with this administrator is the information that is required in order for the administrator to select and notify sweepstakes winners, and to provide them with their prizes (for example, your email address and language preference). These types of service providers are not allowed to use your personally identifiable information for their own purposes.

In addition, in the event that someone buys or acquires NPD, or substantially all of its assets relating to NPD Online Research or its online survey business, the information we have collected from you will of course be one of the acquired assets. For more information see our “Notification of Changes” section below. We also reserve the right to disclose such information if we deem necessary to (i) defend, or to enforce the rights of NPD or its affiliates, partners or customers, and/or (ii) comply with the requirements of any law, regulation or judicial or governmental subpoena, warrant or other order, or the requests of a governmental or other legal or quasi-legal enforcement body.

**

Security

**

NPD employs physical, electronic and managerial protections and procedures to help prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure or loss of the data NPD collects on the website and through its NPD Online Research surveys. The data is stored on secure servers, and only authorized employees of NPD have access to non-aggregated data. These employees work on password-protected computers and are subject to NPD’s confidentiality policies and procedures. If you have any questions concerning the steps taken by NPD to protect the security of the data you provide to us, you can contact us using the information provided below under "Contacting NPD."

Notification of Changes

**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, a notice on the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.
