**MEMBERSHIP**

**Information Collected During Registration**

In order to become a Member, participate in surveys and access certain portions of the NPD Online Research web site, you must first complete our Member registration process. This requires you to select a password and give us contact information (e.g. e-mail address) and demographic information (e.g. zip/postal code, date of birth, income level). You may also be required to provide information concerning other relevant topics (e.g. your computer type and information about your web usage, personal interests, etc). NPD does not collect your name and mailing address during our registration process. 

After you register for the NPDOR Panel, US Panelists will be given the opportunity to join SweepLand, our fee-free Sweepstakes program where you earn points for completing eligible surveys and can use those points as entries into sweepstakes on www.sweepland.com. An NPDOR panelist must complete a one-time SweepLand registration in order to activate their SweepLand account. SweepLand registration information, including your name and mailing address, is collected solely to ensure that we can deliver prizes to sweepstakes winners and to keep members informed of SweepLand program updates / happenings. You do not have to join SweepLand to be a member of the NPDOR panel. 

Your contact information is used to send you a welcome e-mail when you register, to notify you when there is a survey available, or for Member communications (for example, Sweepstakes Winners, birthday wishes or Member newsletters). 

Demographic data is collected to ensure that we send you surveys relevant to your lifestyle and interests. It is used only for statistical and classification purposes in aggregated or summary form (grouped together with other panelists' data) and is NOT shared or sold on an individual basis. 

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users who are under the age of 13 or users under the age of 18 who reside in Maine.

At registration and in each communication with you thereafter, you may opt-out of receiving future surveys and mailings; see _How To Unsubscribe_ below.

**Sharing Your Personally Identifiable Information**

NPD aggregates (groups) the survey information it collects from all responding panelists and uses that aggregated information in its business. 

Personally identifiable information means any information that may be used to identify you, such as your name, phone number, e-mail address, or mailing address. NPD will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party unless you consent in advance, or for any of the following reasons: 

  1. to allow service providers (agents) retained by us to perform panel-related services on our behalf (e.g. sweepstakes program management and fulfillment). These service providers receive this information on a strictly limited, confidential basis; they are required to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the purposes of providing the services that we have asked them to perform;
  2. to comply with law, governmental requirement or legal process;
  3. to protect our property and legal rights, including those of our partners and customers, when we believe that they are, or are at risk of, being misappropriated, interfered with, or injured; and 
  4. to facilitate co-sponsored surveys with strategic partners bound by this Privacy Policy; provided, however, that such strategic partners will not utilize your personal information to send any marketing or promotional materials to you.



In the event of the acquisition of NPD, or substantially all of its assets relating to NPD Online Research or its online survey business, the information we have collected from you will be among the acquired assets. Such information will remain subject to restrictions no less stringent than permitted under the Privacy Policy in effect at that time. Please see "Notification of Changes" for information on how we will contact you. 

**Member Surveys**

NPD surveys collect a wide variety of information on a diverse range of current topics. Your participation in our surveys is always voluntary. However, once you have submitted survey responses to NPD, those responses cannot be recalled or altered. The information collected through NPD's surveys is used only for statistical and classification purposes in aggregated or summary form and is NOT shared, sold or used on an individual basis. The information we collect is stored and processed in our data processing facility, which is currently located in New York, U.S.A. 

**Sweepstakes and Rewards**

Panelists who are legal residents of the 50 United States (and the District of Columbia) and 13 years or older at the time of enrollment are eligible to join SweepLand, NPDOR's fee-free Sweepstakes program where panelists earn points for completing eligible surveys and can use those points as entries into sweepstakes on [www.sweepland.com](http://www.sweepland.com/). A NPDOR panelist must complete a one-time SweepLand registration in order to activate their SweepLand account. SweepLand registration information, including your name and mailing address, is collected solely to ensure that we can deliver prizes to sweepstakes winners and to keep members informed of SweepLand program updates / happenings. SweepLand membership is not required to be a member of the NPDOR panel.   
For complete SweepLand Terms and Conditions, please [click here](http://sweepland.com/Terms/PubIndex.aspx). 

By responding to a survey which includes a sweepstakes offer, or by enrolling in SweepLand, you agree to let NPD share your contact information (e-mail address) with an independent third-party sweepstakes administrator. Your contact information is used by the administrator only to let you know if you have won a sweepstakes or to communicate program information. To receive your prize, you will be required to submit and/or verify certain information to the administrator (e.g. name and mailing address). This information is used only to mail your prize to you. When claiming prizes, winners also complete an online affidavit, which gives NPD permission to post winners' names and state or country of residence.

NPD may also from time to time offer you the opportunity to claim cash rewards or other incentives for completed surveys. To receive your reward, you may be required to submit and/or verify certain information (e.g. name and mailing address) to an independent third-party administrator, so it may provide your reward to you.
