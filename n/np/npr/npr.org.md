# NPR Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy  
Effective Date February 06, 2013

_See related:[NPR Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about/termsofuse.html)_

At NPR, we recognize the importance of privacy to visitors of NPR.org, NPR’s mobile sites and applications, NPR’s interactive voice response service, any other NPR sites, applications and services, and any features of these sites, applications and services (the "NPR Services"). This Privacy Policy explains what type of information is collected from you when you visit the NPR Services and how that information may be used. Please note that this Privacy Policy is separate and distinct from the privacy policies governing the web sites, applications and services of NPR's member stations, and the web sites, applications and services that may link to or from the NPR Services.

**Gathering of Information**  
NPR collects personally-identifying information (such as your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, and credit card information) from the NPR Services for a variety of purposes.

NPR asks visitors to provide certain personal information when they register for certain features or services of the NPR Services (for example, the NPR Community, Application Programming Interface (API) Content access, and NPR e-mail newsletters), when they create a profile in the NPR Community, when they make a donation, when they e-mail, send via SMS (Short Message Service) or text message, or otherwise share a story from the NPR Services, when they make a purchase from the NPR Shop, when they post, upload, transmit and/or otherwise submit ("Submit") a comment, message, story idea, essay, photo, image, or other text, content or material ("User Materials"), and when they register for any online contests. In some cases, NPR records the telephone number of your mobile device when you access NPR’s mobile sites and applications, interactive voice response service, or any features of these sites, applications and services ("NPR Mobile Services"). NPR also may ask visitors to provide personal information in other limited circumstances specified at the time the information is gathered. Any information that you Submit on or through the NPR Community or other social networking features, as part of story or blog comments, or otherwise Submit to the NPR Services, may become public, including the full name and nickname that you provide when registering for the NPR Community.

Like all other Web servers, NPR's Web server automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses the NPR Services. These "access logs" allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. For users of NPR Mobile Services, the access logs record the identifier provided for your mobile device by your wireless carrier ("carrier identifier"). Otherwise, the access logs do NOT record a visitor's name, address, e-mail address, credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information. Rather, they contain some or all of the following information:

  * The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine which accessed the NPR Services. 
  * General location information (based on IP Address)
  * The date of the visit. 
  * The time of the visit. 
  * The path taken through the NPR Services. 
  * The browser being used. 
  * A list of files downloaded or viewed. 
  * The amount of time spent listening to/viewing media files. 
  * Any errors encountered. 



**Cookies and Other Technologies**  
NPR also uses 'cookies' to collect information. A cookie is a string of characters that can be written to a file on the user's hard drive when the user visits a web site, application or service. Only the web site, application or service that set the cookie can read it, and it can only be used as a record keeping device to store user IDs and information that the site already has. It cannot be used to read other information from the user's hard drive.

NPR uses cookies to track users' activity through the NPR Services in order to improve the site/application/service architecture, to offer the user interactive features that would not be possible without them, to offer local station content, to recall specific information to save the user time during subsequent visits to the NPR Services, and to direct more relevant sponsorship or underwriting messages to the user while the user is on the NPR Services, based on the user’s activity on the NPR Services. For example, cookies allow NPR to remember your registration information while you are logged in. Local station customization, the NPR Shop, and other interactive features also use cookies. 

Third party vendors that measure and analyze the use of the NPR Services for NPR, provide NPR’s discussion platform and serve sponsorship messages onto the NPR Services, also use their own cookies. In addition, NPR works with third party vendors which may serve sponsorship or other messages to you on other web sites after you visit the NPR Services. These third party vendors use their own cookies to recognize you as an NPR Services visitor and to serve you sponsorship or other messages on other web sites that they believe you will find most relevant. 

NPR and its third party vendors also may use web beacons, alone or in conjunction with cookies. A web beacon is an electronic image, also known as a single-pixel (1x1) or clear .gif., which can be used to recognize certain information on your computer, such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, or a description of where API Content is placed. We may use web beacons on this site from time to time for these and other purposes.

**Opting Out of Cookies and Web Beacons**

If you wish to prevent certain or all cookies or web beacons from being set to your hard drive or device, or to clear existing cookies or web beacons from your browser’s or device’s cache, you may be able to disable them in your browser's preferences, although your browser might then be unable to accommodate certain functionalities on the NPR Services.

In addition, if you wish to opt out of receiving personalized or “interest-based” sponsorship or other messages from our third party vendors and other participating companies, please visit <http://networkadvertising.org/choices>. Please note that if you opt out, you will still receive other types of messages that are not personalized or interest-based. Opting out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt out is applied. If you subsequently delete your browser cookies, you will need to opt out again.

For more information about opting out of interest-based messages, visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

**Use of Information**  
The use of personally-identifying information is limited to the following: managing and administering the NPR Services; responding to user messages; listing name and location (city, state and/or country) information provided by users when broadcasting or publishing User Materials; fulfillment of NPR Shop orders; processing donations; contest management; editorial purposes such as contacting users for an online survey; sending NPR e-mail newsletters and other communications, including marketing and promotional communications, from NPR or NPR member stations to users who have 'opted in' to the receipt of such communications; other internal NPR or NPR member station purposes; and other purposes specified at the time the information is gathered. NPR may contact users regarding their submissions in certain circumstances.

Any information that you disclose when participating in the NPR Community (including creating a profile or submitting a comment to a story or blog or in a discussion thread), such as your full name and any nickname, is likely to become public. This information may be posted on the NPR Services and on the platform of NPR’s third party discussion services vendor. In addition, NPR, its member stations and their licensees, may use, copy, sublicense, modify, transmit, publicly perform, display, create derivative works of, host, index, cache, tag, encode, and/or adapt any User Materials, and any information contained therein, in any and all media formats or channels, whether now known or hereafter devised, including, but not limited to, the NPR Services, NPR member station web sites and services, other third party web sites and services, over the air (on radio or television), and on mobile platforms. Further, other users of the NPR Services may embed a widget or feed that allows your User Materials to appear on their personal, noncommercial web site, blog or other application, subject to conditions set forth in the Terms of Use. You also may opt in to sharing your NPR Services profile and comments with other websites and social media platforms, but only by taking action on the website for NPR’s third party discussion services vendor. Any such action is governed by the terms and privacy policy of NPR’s third party discussion services vendor, and not of NPR.

In addition, if you send User Materials to NPR through the NPR Services, we may print the User Materials, or an excerpt from the User Materials, on the NPR Services, read them on air, or otherwise publish them in any other medium, together with your name and location (city, state and/or country) if you provide that information to us.

Excluding information provided by the user when participating in the NPR Community or sending User Materials to NPR, which may become public as discussed above, personally-identifying information collected by NPR is not provided to outside parties except NPR member stations, NPR service vendors (such as NPR Shop fulfillment service, NPR's email list manager, and the provider of the tool that allows users to sign in using information from their account with a third party service), and other third parties when the user specifically consents to such distribution (such as the disclosure of your name to a friend when you email, send via SMS or text message, or otherwise share a story to that friend). In these circumstances, the information is provided for the sole purpose of -- and only to the extent necessary for -- delivering the requested goods to the user, delivering communications from NPR or NPR member stations to users who have 'opted in' to the receipt of these communications, providing services for and on behalf of NPR, or serving other internal NPR or NPR member station purposes.

NPR also may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if it believes that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the NPR Services, or (c) protect the personal safety or property of users of the NPR Services, the public or NPR and its employees.

If you do not want your personally-identifying information to be collected or used for any of these purposes, please do not provide it (although if you do not provide it, you may not be able to use or participate in certain features of the NPR Services). You can also 'opt out' according to the process described below.

NPR, with the assistance from time to time of its third party service vendors, uses non-identifying aggregate information to analyze use of and better design the NPR Services and to share with third parties in aggregate form only as appropriate. For example, we may tell a third party that a certain number of users accessed a particular audio stream on our Web site. We also may share non-identifying aggregate information with third party services that combine NPR’s information with aggregate information from other sources to provide ratings and ranking data or other services of value to NPR. However, we will not disclose any information that could be used to identify those users.

**Security**  
NPR has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Credit card information provided to the NPR Shop is protected against unauthorized use by 128-bit encryption and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security features, which scramble your personal information so that only your browser and the NPR Shop’s server can decipher it. However, no Internet, e-mail or mobile transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Because most e-mail and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail, SMS or text message, or other mobile transmission.

**Children**  
Under 13: You must be at least 13 years old in order to register for e-mail newsletters or other features of the NPR Services. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not send any information about yourself, including your name, address or e-mail address. If we discover that we have collected any personally-identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our database as soon as possible.

13-18: You must be at least 18 years old in order to Submit any User Materials on or through the NPR Services, create a profile in the NPR Community, participate in any online contests, or place an order on the NPR Shop. Visitors between the ages of 13 and 18 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before registering for e-mail newsletters or other features of the NPR Services (excluding the NPR Community, for which they cannot register) or otherwise sending any personally-identifying information.

**Corrections to Personal Data; Opting Out**  
Please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) to a) correct or update any personal information in the NPR database that you state is erroneous, b) opt-out of future communications from NPR, or c) request NPR to make reasonable efforts to remove your personal information from NPR’s database, thereby canceling your NPR Community profile, NPR newsletter registration and other NPR registrations. This will not necessarily remove previous public comments and other User Materials Submitted for public display on the NPR Services. The user understands that it may be impossible to delete personal information entirely because of backups and records of deletions.

**Acceptance of Privacy Policy Terms**  
NPR reserves the right to change this policy. Any changes to this policy will be posted to this page as soon as reasonably possible, so please check this page periodically. Use of the NPR Services constitutes consent to any policy then in effect. Please make sure that you read NPR's [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about/termsofuse.html) to understand additional terms and conditions which apply to the use of the NPR Services.

**Links to other Sites and Services**  
It is important to note that the NPR Services contain links to other sites, applications and services maintained by third parties that may not follow the same privacy policies as the NPR Services. For instance, clicking or tapping on a sponsorship notice or some third party logos on the NPR Services will take you to an entirely different site, application or service. These sites, applications and services may use cookies, collect data, and use the data in ways that the NPR Services would not. NPR is not responsible for the privacy practices or any information or materials on these other sites. Please visit these sites if you wish to review their privacy policies.

In some cases, the NPR Services may include certain embedded tools provided and controlled by third parties and governed by the terms and policies of the third parties. You should only use these third party tools if you agree to their respective terms and policies.

The NPR Services include a tool that allows you to sign in using information from your account with a third party service, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, OpenID, or LinkedIn. Please be aware that those third party services are unrelated to NPR, and that your use of the third party services is subject to the terms and policies of those services.

**International User Notice**  
For international users, please note that it may be necessary to transfer your information internationally and, in particular, your information may be transferred to and processed in the United States. For residents of the European Union: the data protection and other laws of other countries outside of the European Union may not be as comprehensive as those of the European Union. Please be assured that we take steps to ensure that your privacy is protected as described in this policy. By using this site, you agree to have your information used and transferred to the United States as set forth in this policy.
