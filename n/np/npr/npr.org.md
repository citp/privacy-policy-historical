# NPR Privacy Statement

**NPR Online's Privacy Policy**

At NPR Online, we recognize the importance of privacy to visitors of our Web site. This privacy policy explains what type of information is collected from you when you visit our Web site. 

NPR does not collect personally-identifying information from the NPR Web site unless you choose to provide that information to us. 

All of the information collected by NPR is used for internal NPR or NPR member station purposes only and is not distributed to other outside parties, except when a visitor orders a transcript or audio tape through the NPR Web site. In that case, relevant information is provided to NPR’s outside fulfillment service for the sole purpose of delivering the requested transcript and/or audio tape. 

Like all other Web servers, NPR’s Web server automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses our site. These "access logs" allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do NOT record a visitor’s name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information. Rather, they contain some or all of the following information: 

  * The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine which accessed our Web site.
  * The date of the visit.
  * The time of the visit.
  * The path taken through our Web site.
  * The browser being used.
  * A list of files downloaded or viewed.
  * The amount of time spent listening to RealAudio® or Windows Media files.
  * Any errors encountered.



Most Internet Service Providers use a "dynamic" form of assigning IP Addresses. This means that a visitor may have a different IP Address each time he or she visits the NPR Web site. Also, many Internet Service Providers, including America Online, use "Proxy servers" which provide even more anonymity for visitors. For example, all visitors accessing NPR’s Web site through America Online will be recorded in our access logs as having the same IP Address. 

NPR does NOT use "cookies" or other methods of user tracking for the non-participatory sections of our Web site, but it does use cookies for the _Your Turn_ Discussion Boards, in the search function, and for other password protected areas of the site. 

NPR does ask visitors to provide certain personal information when they register for a contest or the NPR _Your Turn_ Discussion Board and when they request a transcript and/or audio tape of NPR shows through an online form. This information is gathered by NPR on a voluntary basis and its use by NPR is limited to the following: contest management, editorial and feedback purposes, fulfillment of transcript and/or audio tape orders, and NPR’s marketing and promotional purposes. By providing this information, a visitor may receive an e-mail from NPR in limited circumstances. Any information that you post when participating in the _Your Turn_ Discussion Board area becomes public. Moreover, by participating in the _Your Turn_ Discussions, your e-mail address becomes available to any third parties accessing our Web site and as a result, you may receive unsolicited e-mail from such third parties. 

**Visitors Under 13:** You must be at least 13 years old in order to register for the _Your Turn_ Discussion Boards, participate in any online contests, or order NPR tapes and transcripts. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not send any information about yourself, including your name, address or e-mail address. If we discover that we have collected any personally-identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our database as soon as possible. 

**Visitors Between 13 and 18:** Visitors between the ages of 13 and 18 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before registering for the _Your Turn_ Discussion Boards, participating in any online contests, ordering NPR tapes or transcripts, or otherwise sending any personally-identifying information. 

**Corrections of Personal Data; Opting Out:** Upon request to the NPR Webmaster,[webmaster@npr.org](mailto:webmaster@npr.org), NPR Online will permit you to a)correct or update any personal information in the NPR Online database that you state is erroneous, b)opt-out of future promotional communications from NPR Online or c)request NPR to make reasonable efforts to remove your personal information from the NPR Online database, thereby canceling your Discussion Board registration. The user understands that it may be impossible to delete personal information entirely because of backups and records of deletions. 

NPR reserves the right to change this policy. Any changes to this policy will be posted to this page as soon as reasonably possible, so please check this page periodically. Use of the NPR Web site constitutes consent to any policy then in effect. 

If you have any questions or comments concerning our privacy policy, please contact us via e-mail at [webmaster@npr.org](mailto:webmaster@npr.org) or by mail at:
