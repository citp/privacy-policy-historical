For example, NPR and Analytics Services may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the Remarketing with Google Analytics and DoubleClick cookies) together to inform, optimize, and serve sponsorship credits based on your past interactions with our Services and other websites or services. In addition, we may use analytics data, including but not limited to, geographic, demographic, and interest reporting information to recognize and understand user preferences, make improvements, and for other operational purposes. Each Analytics Service's ability to use and share analytics information is restricted by such Analytics Service's terms of use and privacy policy.

**How We Disclose Information**

NPR is committed to maintaining your trust. We want you to understand when and with whom we and service providers working on our behalf may share information about you that is collected through our Services.

**_User Materials._** Any User Materials you submit through our [Contact Us](http://www.npr.org/contact/) page, social networking services or similar features can be seen, collected and used by us and anyone else who has access to the applicable service. Such information is likely to become public and we cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use. Any User Materials you submit may also be freely used and shared by NPR and its Member stations and their respective licensees in accordance with our [Terms of Use](http://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use).

**_Member stations._** NPR may share your name, email address, other contact information, and information about your listening activity, donations and interests with the Member stations that are associated with your account or that are local to you. When we do so, we require those Member stations to commit to the same policies regarding further sharing with third parties that we follow under this Privacy Policy. If you do not want us to share your name, contact information, or other information, including information about your donations to NPR, with Member stations, you can [contact us](https://help.npr.org/customer/portal/emails/new?i=5&s=NPR%20Management) any time. However, if you choose to donate to an NPR Member station through our Services, your information may be collected directly by that Member station. In that case, the collection of your information is subject to that Member station's privacy policy.

**_Authorized service providers._** We may share any information we collect with service providers who provide us with specialized services or otherwise help us operate our Services including, without limitation, service providers that provide customer support, email deployment, account sign-in services, payment processing, order fulfillment, analytics, marketing, suppression list management, contest management and data processing services. Our service providers include the service providers' subcontractors that provide specialized services to us or otherwise help us operate our Services. If you wish to make a payment or receive a refund through our Services, your information will be collected and controlled by the payment processor and not by us and will be subject to that payment service provider's privacy policy and practices.

**_Authorized third-party applications._** We may share with authorized third-party applications information that you provide directly through our Services and information collected automatically through technology for the purpose of providing certain NPR Services to you on the applications. In such cases, the information that we share may include your name, favorite stations, and listening activity. NPR prohibits the third-party developers of those applications from accessing, storing or sharing any such non-public information. However, please be aware that your use of the third-party application is otherwise subject to the third-party application's privacy policy, which we do not control and which may differ significantly from ours. NPR is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third-party application and we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of any third-party sites, applications, platforms, and services that you visit or access.

**_Business transfers._** We may share any collected information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of an NPR Service or division, a merger, a consolidation, an asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

**_Legal requirements._** We and service providers working on our behalf may disclose any collected information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, and other law enforcement measures, and to comply with legal or regulatory obligations.

**_Protect our Services and users._** We and service providers working on our behalf may disclose any collected information to enforce our [Terms of Use](http://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use) and to protect and defend the legal rights, interests, and safety of NPR, NPR Member stations, their respective employees, agents, contractors, sponsors, listeners and users, members of the general public, or others.

**_With your consent._** We and service providers working on our behalf may share any collected information when you expressly or implicitly consent to such disclosure. For example, if you use our Services to email or text a story to a friend, we would disclose your name to that friend together with the content you directed us to send.

**_Wireless carriers and automobile manufacturers._** Wireless carriers and automobile manufacturers also may collect contact and other information and precise location data from our mobile services users through processes we do not control. You should check the privacy policies of your wireless carriers and automobile manufacturers for additional information.

**_Podcast producers._** We may share with third-party producers listening and other data that does not identify you that we collect through your interaction with the podcasts and other media files produced by those third-party producers.

**_Bitly._** __ NPR uses a service called Bitly to create shortened uniform resource locators ("URLs" – the "addresses" of individual web pages) for our content so that it can be shared easily, particularly through social media. Bitly collects information as our shortened URLs are shared and clicked on, including IP addresses, general location information, the time and day each shortened URL is accessed, and the social media or other channels through which our content is shared. If you have established a separate account with Bitly, Bitly may associate the foregoing information with personal information it has stored in your Bitly account in accordance with Bitly's own [privacy policy](https://bitly.com/pages/privacy). To share our content without using Bitly, copy the full URL of the story you want to share from your browser and paste it into your email, text or social media message.

**_Aggregated and anonymous information._** Subject to applicable law and your opt-out choices described below, and as we deem appropriate, we may share with third parties or allow them to collect directly any aggregated or other information that does not directly identify you as an individual. Such information may be used and combined with other information collected by the receiving parties pursuant to their own respective privacy policies, which we don't control. For example, we may share or authorize the collection of such information by service providers that help us analyze and improve our Services, provide us and other digital media organizations with ratings and ranking data, help us to create personalized content, or tailor sponsorship credits to your interests. We may also share or authorize the collection of such information by sponsors or their agencies to help them measure the impact of their sponsorship campaigns.

**Your Choices**

You have the following choices to update, correct and limit the collection and use of information gathered through our Services.

**_Don't volunteer information._** __ If you do not consent to the collection, use or sharing of your contact and other information as described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the NPR Services or provide information to us. By using the NPR Services or providing information to us through the NPR Services, you are "opting in" to the collection, use and sharing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.

**_Registration information_** **.** Sign in to your NPR account or [contact us](https://help.npr.org/customer/portal/emails/new?i=5&s=NPR%20Management) to correct or update any registration information you provided to us, opt out of future email newsletters from us, or cancel your NPR account, NPR newsletter subscription or other NPR registrations. For your protection, we may only act on requests with respect to the registration data associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may ask you to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a correction, update or cancellation.

**_Donation information_** **.** If you are a donor to NPR and do not want us to share your name, contact information or other information with any Member station, you can opt out of such sharing at the time you make the donation or you can [contact us](https://help.npr.org/customer/portal/emails/new?i=5&s=NPR%20Management) any time. However, if you choose to donate to an NPR Member station through our Services, your information may be collected directly by that Member station. In that case, the collection of your information is subject to that Member station's privacy policy.

**_Cookies._** You have the option to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, or delete cookies. Each browser is different, so select the "Help" menu in your browser for instructions on how to use the relevant tools and settings.

For iOS mobile devices, go to "Settings" from your device's home screen, scroll down to "Privacy", select "Advertising", and turn on "Limit Ad Tracking." For Android mobile devices, go to "Google Settings" on your device, select "Ads"; and check the box labeled "Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads" or "Opt Out of Ads Personalization." (These device settings options may change in the future or otherwise may differ for certain devices; consult your device manufacturer's support literature for the most current information).

Note that if you opt out, you may still receive the same number of sponsorship credits as before but they may not be as relevant to your interests. Opting out of third-party interest-based sponsorship credits is a cookie-based process and will only affect the specific computer, device, and browser on which your opt-out choice is applied. If you subsequently delete your browser cookies, you will need to opt out again.

**_Precise location information_** **.** If you consent to our collection of your precise device location through an NPR mobile application, you can withdraw your consent at any time and prevent the further collection of your precise location by accessing the privacy settings of your mobile device and/or the settings of the NPR mobile application.

**Do Not Track**

We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals. Instead, we adhere to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy and offer the choices described above.

**Security**

We employ physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards in an effort to secure the information we collect. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information. Because no security system is impenetrable, however, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases or that information you supply will never be intercepted, accessed, or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Because most email and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email, text messages, or other mobile transmissions.

**Links to and from Other Sites and Services**

Our Services contain links to other sites, applications, platforms and services operated by third parties whose privacy policies we don't control and may differ significantly from ours. For instance, clicking or tapping on a sponsorship credit or some third-party logos on the NPR Services will take you to an entirely different site or service that may collect, use and share information in ways that NPR would not. You also may access NPR content and the NPR Services from a third-party site or service that may collect, use and share information in ways that NPR would not. NPR is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these third-party services and we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of any such sites or services you visit or access.

**Social Networking Services Sign-in and Sharing Tools**

Our Services allow users to sign in to their NPR accounts using their credentials on social networking services such as Facebook and Google+ (each an "SNS"). If you sign in to our Services through an SNS, we will receive your email address and certain profile information from such SNS in accordance with its privacy policy and your SNS account privacy settings. Any information that we collect from your SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have selected with that SNS, so please consult the applicable SNS's privacy and data policies to learn how to manage these settings.

If you use tools on our Services that allow you to share stories or other content with your friends and followers on an SNS such as Facebook, Twitter, Flipboard, or Google+, that action and any information you share may be used by the SNS according to its own privacy policy.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

NPR reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted to this page, so please check back periodically. Your use of our Services constitutes consent to the Privacy Policy then in effect. Please read NPR's [Terms of Use](http://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use) to understand additional terms and conditions that apply to your use of our Services.

**Users Outside the U.S.**

Our Services are controlled and operated within the United States. Any information we collect may be transferred to, and processed, stored, and accessed by, us and our service providers in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we or our service providers operate. These jurisdictions may have data privacy laws that may not be as protective as those of your home jurisdiction, and courts and other authorities may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to access information about you subject to such data privacy laws. By using the NPR Services, you agree to this transfer, processing, storage, and access of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

NOTICE TO EU RESIDENTS: Our handling of information about EU residents is governed by the [NPR Privacy Notice for EU Residents](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/609131973/npr-privacy-notice-for-eu-residents), effective May 25, 2018. This Privacy Policy does not apply to EU residents.
