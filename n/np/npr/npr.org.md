# NPR Linking and Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy  
Updated June 27, 2002

At NPR Online, we recognize the importance of privacy to visitors of our Web site. This privacy policy explains what type of information is collected from you when you visit our Web site. 

NPR collects personally-identifying information from the NPR Web site only if you choose to provide that information to us. 

**Gathering of Information**

Like all other Web servers, NPR's Web server automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses our site. These "access logs" allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do NOT record a visitor's name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information. Rather, they contain some or all of the following information: 

• The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine which accessed our Web site.   
• The date of the visit.   
• The time of the visit.   
• The path taken through our Web site.   
• The browser being used.   
• A list of files downloaded or viewed.   
• The amount of time spent listening to RealAudio®, Windows Media, or Apple Quicktime files.   
• Any errors encountered. 

NPR asks visitors to provide certain personal information when they register for a contest or the NPR Discussions, when they request a transcript and/or audio tape of NPR programs, and when they make a purchase from the NPR Online Shop. NPR also may ask visitors to provide personal information in other limited circumstances specified at the time the information is gathered. Any information that you post when participating in the Discussions becomes public. Moreover, by participating in the Discussions, your e-mail address becomes available to any third parties accessing our Web site and as a result, you may receive unsolicited e-mail from such third parties. 

**Cookies**

NPR also uses cookies to collect information. A cookie is a string of characters that can be written to a file on the user's hard drive when the user visits a Web site. Only the Web site that set the cookie can read it, and it can only be used as a record keeping device to store information that the site already has. It cannot, for example, be used to read other information from the user's hard drive. 

NPR uses cookies to track users' activity through the site in order to improve the site's architecture and to offer the user interactive features that would not be possible without them. Local station customization, the Discussions, the NPR Online Shop, and other interactive features use cookies. If you wish to prevent cookies from being set to your hard drive you may disable them in your browser's preferences. 

**Use of Information**

The information collected by NPR is used for internal NPR or NPR member station purposes. The use of personal information is limited to the following: contest management, editorial and feedback purposes, fulfillment of transcript and/or audio tape orders, fulfillment of NPR Online Shop orders, NPR's marketing and promotional purposes, or other internal NPR or NPR member station purposes. By providing this information, a visitor may receive an e-mail from NPR or NPR member stations in limited circumstances. 

Information collected by NPR is not distributed to other outside parties, except when a visitor orders a transcript or audio tape through the NPR Web site, makes a purchase at the NPR Online Shop, or otherwise consents to the distribution of such information to an outside party. In that case, relevant information is provided to NPR's outside fulfillment service for the sole purpose of delivering the requested transcript and/or audio tape, or goods purchased from the NPR Online Shop, or is provided to a third party pursuant to a visitor's specific consent. 

Credit card information provided to the NPR Online Shop is protected against unauthorized use by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information before it is sent. 

**Children**

**Under 13:** You must be at least 13 years old in order to register for the Discussions, order NPR tapes and transcripts, or place an order on the NPR Online Shop. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not send any information about yourself, including your name, address or e-mail address. If we discover that we have collected any personally-identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our database as soon as possible. 

**13 -18:** Unless otherwise specified, you must be a least 18 years old in order to participate in any online contests. Visitors between the ages of 13 and 18 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before registering for the Discussions, ordering NPR tapes or transcripts, placing an order on the NPR Online Shop, or otherwise sending any personally-identifying information. 

**Corrections to Personal Data; Opting Out**

Please write to nprhelp@npr.org to a)correct or update any personal information in the NPR Online database that you state is erroneous, b)opt-out of future promotional communications from NPR Online or c)request NPR to make reasonable efforts to remove your personal information from the NPR Online database, thereby canceling your Discussions registration. The user understands that it may be impossible to delete personal information entirely because of backups and records of deletions. 

NPR reserves the right to change this policy. Any changes to this policy will be posted to this page as soon as reasonably possible, so please check this page periodically. Use of the NPR Web site constitutes consent to any policy then in effect. 

If you have any questions or comments concerning our privacy policy, please contact us via e-mail at [nprhelp@npr.org](mailto:nprhelp@npr.org) or by mail at:

**Links to other Sites**

It is important to note that npr.org contains links to other sites that may not follow the same privacy policies as npr.org. For instance, clicking on a sponsorship notice on npr.org will take you to an entirely different site. These sites may use cookies, collect data, and use the data in ways that npr.org would not. NPR is not responsible for the privacy practices or any information or materials on these other sites.
