### Information Collected Automatically 

We and our service providers may also automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use one of the Services (“Usage Information”).  Usage Information may include your IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system characteristics, information about your use of the Service, geographic location, and data regarding network-connected hardware (e.g., computer or mobile device). Usage Information helps us learn about a user’s visits to our Services by visualizing the number and duration of visits, pages viewed, site navigation, and other statistics. We use this knowledge to enhance and customize user experience and to monitor and improve performance of the Services. We may use IP addresses to help diagnose problems and for general statistical website reporting, and may link IP addresses as part of your registration for the Show. 

The methods that may be used to collect Usage Information on the Services include:

  * _Log Information_ : Log information is data about your use of the Services, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data. Log information may be stored in log files. 
  * _Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies_ :Cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking, and other tracking technologies (“Tracking Technologies”) may be used to collect information about your interactions with the Services or e-mails, including information to understand users’ browsing and buying activities, and to optimize our advertising campaigns on the Services. Brief descriptions of common Tracking Technologies are provided below. 
    * **Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Services and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies remain longer and help in understanding how you use the Services, and enhance your user experience. Cookies may remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you use your browser’s method of blocking or removing cookies, some but not all types of cookies may be deleted and/or blocked and as a result, some features and functionalities of the Services may not work.  A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file, which may be placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device.  HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Flash cookies and HTML5 cookies are locally stored on your device and browser settings will not control them.  To identify certain types of local shared objects on your device and adjust your settings, please [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html).  The Services may associate some or all of these types of cookies with your device(s).

](https://web.archive.org/nahb-cookies-notice.aspx)[Manage Cookies](https://web.archive.org/manage-cookies.aspx)
    * **Web Beacons**  
Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as “internet tags,” “clear gifs,” or “tracking pixels,” which are embedded in web pages. We may use web beacons to determine if a user has visited a particular website, or to collect similar information that helps us customize our advertising. 
    * **Embedded Scripts**  
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server, or from a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and deleted or deactivated thereafter. 
    * **Device Recognition Technologies**  
Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household).
    * **In-App Tracking Methods**  
There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs,” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices.



Some information about your use of the Services and certain third-party services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services, and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Services and certain third-party services. 

By continuing to use the Services, you are agreeing to the placement of Tracking Technologies by us or by our partners for purposes of analyzing your use of the Services. 

_Opt Out_

Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed using tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances may be blocked in the future by configuring certain browser settings.  Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately.  Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies.  Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some aspects of the Services’ functionality may be limited.  

Your browser settings may also allow you to transmit a “Do Not Track” signal when you visit various websites.

### Information We Collect From Other Sources

We may also obtain information about you from other sources, including service providers and other websites, locations, platforms or services not operated by NAHB (“Third-Party Services”), and combine that with information we collect about you. For example, we may obtain information about you, including name, postal address, phone number, and employment-related information, from state and local home building associations. For the Show, we may also obtain information about you from our vendors. Such data will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible or liable for the accuracy of the information provided by third parties or for third-party policies or practices. 

### Use of Information for Advertising and Analytics

We may use the personal information we collect to serve advertisements on the Services and/or Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Services and elsewhere on the Internet (sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising”), which may include sending you an ad on a Third-Party Service after you have left the Services (i.e., “re-targeting”).

We also use Google Analytics and Feathr for analytics services, and employ Google Display feature “Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting.” We use these services as well as others that may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help us analyze Service users and how they interact with the Services. Information collected or generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these service providers, who may in turn use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Services, compiling statistical reports on the Services’ activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other Internet usage. 

_Opt Out_

You may opt out of Google Analytics via your Ads Settings, Ads Settings for mobile apps, or via the opt-out [site](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

Please be aware that even if you are able to opt-out of certain kinds of targeted advertising, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

**Links to Third-Party Sites**

The Services may contain links to Third-Party Services, including links to state and local homebuilders associations; these links are provided for your convenience and information. If you choose to use any of these links, you will be leaving the Services. These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons and other Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit personal information from you. 

The privacy practices of these Third-Party Services may differ from our privacy practices and are not controlled by us, nor are they covered by this Privacy Policy.
