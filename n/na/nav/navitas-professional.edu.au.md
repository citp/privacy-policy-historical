## Explaining the legal basis for processing your personal data

The Company is a global company and understands that the laws on data protection may be different in different countries, however, the Company has set out below a number of different reasons for which we may collect and process your personal data, including:

**Consent**

  1. In specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent for example, when you tick a box to receive marketing material from us.
  2. When collecting your personal data, we’ll endeavour to collect the minimum necessary for us to provide our services.



**Parental Consent**

  1. Depending upon national and sometimes state law you may be called a “minor” when it comes to signing a contract or consenting for us to collect and process your personal data. This means you have not reached the __legal age of consent__.
  2. In many countries including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore and the USA, it is usual to require a person to be 18 years of age. 
  3. In Europe it is usual that a person is 16 years of age, 13 in the U.K. to consent to receive marketing information. As part of protecting you and your rights, if the law says you are still a “minor”, we require your parents/guardians consent to directly collect and process your data via online services.

  2. We will collect this data so that we can make an offer to you to study or enrol with us or to work with us.
