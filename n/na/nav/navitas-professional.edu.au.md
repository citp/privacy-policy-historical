# Privacy Policy - Navitas Professional » Navitas Professional

### Overview

Navitas Professional is subject to the Australian Privacy Act 1998.

This Act gives people some control over the personal information they provide to an agency and the right to know how it will be used.

This Web Privacy Statement outlines how Navitas Professional deals with personal information related to our website. Users of our website are entitled to expect that any information collected will be treated within the terms of the Australian privacy responsibilities and obligations.

### What is personal information?

Personal information includes any information or opinion about an individual whose identity is apparent or can be readily identified from the information or opinion. For further information visit the Office of the Privacy Commissioner website.

### What information do we collect automatically?

When you look at this website, our computers record your visit and log the following information for statistical purposes:

  * the Internet Protocol address from which we receive the request
  * the date and time our server received the request
  * the pages, documents and files you requested
  * the address of the resource which provided the link followed, if any, to this website
  * the type of browser and, in some cases, the operating system used
  * in some cases, data you send to our website from web forms (e.g. search terms).



Some sections of this website use standard industry technologies, for example 'cookies', to make full use of the site.

### What do we do with the information?

The anonymous information collected during each request is collated for analysis. It is then evaluated and published in reports that show usage patterns and identify popular areas of the website. This helps us to improve and develop the website and its services.

For security reasons, Navitas Professional uses software programs to monitor network traffic and identify unauthorised attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

### What won't we do with the information?

We will not disclose or externally publish personal information without consent.

No attempt will be made to identify individual users or their browsing activities except for when, in the unlikely event of an investigation, a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect our logs.

Apart from an occasion when it may be required to do so by law, Navitas Professional will not disclose your personal information to a third party unless you have authorised it to do so.

### What exceptions are there to this rule?

Navitas Professional will gather more extensive information than stated above in the following circumstances:

  * unauthorised attempts to access files other than those published on this website
  * unauthorised tampering or interference with files published on this website
  * unauthorised attempts by other websites to index the contents of this website
  * attempts to intercept messages of other Navitas Professional website users
  * communications which are defamatory, abusive, vilify individuals or groups or give rise to a suspicion that an offence is being committed
  * attempts to otherwise compromise the security of the Navitas Professional web server, breach the laws of the State of Western Australia or Commonwealth of Australia, or interfere with the use of this website by other users.



We reserve the right to make disclosures to relevant authorities where the use of our website raises concern that an offence is being, or has been, committed.

In the unlikely event of an investigation, Navitas Professional will provide data access to any law enforcement agency that may exercise a warrant to inspect our logs.

### Who has access to raw data automatically captured by our website?

Navitas Professional captures web access information on its own computers.

Access to the raw data on the web server is restricted to a limited number of staff who analyse and report on the success of the website in order to meet communication and access objectives.

### Is data stored in a secure way?

Navitas Professional websites have security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. However, no system is 100% secure. We meet legislative requirements and follow industry best practice to ensure the security of the website.

If you do not wish to use the Internet, you can contact us by telephone, fax or mail.

### Do we record email addresses?

We will only record your email address if you enter it into a web form or send us a message. We will not use your email address for any other purpose than that for which you have provided, and we will not disclose it without your consent, unless there is evidence that an offence has been committed.

### How do we deal with Information Request Forms?

When you lodge an online request with us you provide us with personal information which may include your name, contact number, postal and email address. We collect and retain this information in order to respond to your inquiry and provide a service.

A record of your enquiry will also be collected for statistical purposes, to determine usage of our services and provide information for future improvements. No personal details are provided to any other individual or organisation, and access to this information is restricted to Navitas staff and contractors responsible for delivery of the service or activity.

### How do we deal with Online Enrolment Forms?

When you apply for entry to a Navitas Professional facility you provide us with personal information which may include your name, contact number, postal and email address and date of birth. We collect and retain this information to enable delivery of services, to determine usage of our services and collection and to provide information to assist with future improvements. When you register you have the option to receive information about Navitas services and activities or to take part in Navitas surveys.

Access to this information is restricted to Navitas staff and contractors responsible for delivery of the service or activity. Your personal details will not be provided to any other individual or organisation without your consent.

### Do we publish personal information on this website?

Navitas Professional will only publish personal information on this website if it has been collected for this purpose with your knowledge and consent.

When giving such consent you should be aware that information published on this website is accessible to millions of users from all over the world, that it will be indexed by search engines and that it may be copied and used by any web user. This means that once the information is published on this website, we will have no control over its subsequent use and disclosure.

Names and email addresses of Navitas Professional staff appearing on this website are provided with their knowledge and consent.

Under no circumstances will Navitas Professional sell or receive payment for licensing or disclosing your personal information.

### What about external links?

This site contains links to other sites. Navitas Professional is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

### Can I access and correct my personal information?

You have the right to access your personal information.

Navitas Professional will take reasonable steps to ensure your personal information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. Should you wish to access or amend this information, please contact us.
