If you’d prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so.

Navy.com uses clear GIFs, or pixel tags, provided by our ad-serving company to help manage our online advertising.

## Freedom of Information Act

The U.S. [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](http://foia.navy.mil/ "foia.navy.mil | Department of the Navy, Freedom of Information Act") is a law ensuring public access to U.S. government records. FOIA carries a presumption of disclosure; the burden is on the government - not the public - to substantiate why information may not be released. Upon written request, agencies of the United States government are required to disclose those records, unless they can be lawfully withheld from disclosure under one of nine specific exemptions in the FOIA. This right of access is ultimately enforceable in federal court.
