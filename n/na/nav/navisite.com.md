## GDPR

The EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, more commonly known as the “GDPR”, is a new European data protection law that will replace existing European data protection rules from 25 May 2018. The GDPR aims to strengthen and harmonize the data protection regime across the EU, and brings about some key changes to the existing requirements. We have been actively reviewing and assessing our services against these new requirements, and are working to ensure that they will comply with the GDPR.

The GDPR may also impose new requirements on our customers, including in relation to their use of our services. Please note that our compliance with the GDPR does not necessarily mean that our customers automatically comply with the GDPR. We are committed to helping our customers with their compliance efforts, and are preparing tools designed to assist them in meeting their obligations when they use our services. However, we strongly encourage our customers to review their own collection and use of personal data, including in relation to their use of our services.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us. You can also find out more about the GDPR on [the official EU website](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en).

## Security

Navisite uses reasonable efforts to treat all consumer information, not just the sensitive and private information mentioned above, in a confidential manner. The organization is driven by policies and controls where data and records are classified and processed appropriately. For example, websites, where technically feasible, enforce the encryption sensitive data in transit using technologies such as secure socket layer (SSL). For managed messaging services, object layer encryption and transport layer encryption (TLS) are used to secure messages. Although Navisite has a base layer of security for all clients, each environment has addition controls that are sized and positioned based on individual client requirements. Navisite observes the core security concept, CIA Triad, of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. The policies, procedures, guidelines, baselines, and standards employed by Navisite in conjunction with the client’s team follow industry best practices, where feasible. As a result, Navisite and subsequently clients experience a heightened level of security. If you have any questions about security on our websites, you can contact [webinfo@navisite.com](mailto:webinfo@navisite.com).

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage prior to the change becoming effective.

If, however, we are going to use users' personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by email or by posting a prominent notice on our websites 30 days prior to implementing the change.

## Miscellaneous

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Navisite or its affiliates. This Privacy Policy and the statements outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
