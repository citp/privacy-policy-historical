## Microsite

Access to certain of NaviSite's web pages are accessible only by email invitation containing a link to a private site created specifically for the intended user (the "Microsite"). Information that a user provides to us within the Microsite may be used for permission purposes, tracking information on how often users access their Microsite and which documents they view to give NaviSite feedback on the effectiveness of its content.

## Links to Third-Party Web sites

In the event this Site contains links to other sites owned and maintained by companies other than NaviSite, NaviSite is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. Users should check the applicable privacy policy of such linked sites.

## Use of Cookies

Users should also be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of the Site web server or through the use of 'cookies.' "Cookies" are used within the Site to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of the information on our Site to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.

NaviSite does not correlate this information with data about individual users, with the exception of users of our Microsite. NaviSite may provide aggregated cookie data to third parties for analysis purposes. NaviSite is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.   
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.

If you prefer not to receive cookies on this Site, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any area of the NaviSite Site.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by NaviSite, Inc. only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

## Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

One of our third party advertising partners employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

To learn more about our third party advertising partners’ use of clear gifs, please go to LeadForce1's privacy policy.
