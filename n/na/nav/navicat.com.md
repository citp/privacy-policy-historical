User Registration Information  
We think our customers understand better than anyone else how PremiumSoft can most effectively serve their needs. Because of this, PremiumSoft makes every effort to allow our customers to define the relationship they will have with us. We ask our customers how they would like PremiumSoft to communicate with them, if at all. We disclose how we will be using our customers' information through documents like this one, or by answering individual questions customers may ask. Also, we never sell our customers' information or provide it to others without making it clear that we intend to do so at the time the information is collected.

  
PremiumSoft Network Information  
Our website's registration system requires you to give us some contact information (like a user name or email address) and unique identifiers (like a password). Unique identifiers are collected to verify your identity and are used as account numbers in our record system.

  
Online Ordering Information  
Our site uses an order form for customers to purchase products and services. We collect contact information (like your email address), unique identifiers (like your password), and financial information (like your account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders.

At this Site, there may be links to companies with whom we have a relationship. PremiumSoft is not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners. We encourage you to read their privacy statements, as they may differ from ours.
