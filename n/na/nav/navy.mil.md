Notice:  
This is a U.S. Government Web Site 

This is a World Wide Web site for official information about the United States Navy. It is provided as a public service by the [U.S. Navy's Office of Information, Washington, D.C.](http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/) The purpose of this Web site is to provide information about the United States Navy to the general public. All information on this site is considered public information and may be distributed or copied unless otherwise specified. Use of appropriate byline/photo/image credits is requested. 

Unauthorized attempts to _upload_ information or _change_ information on this web site are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. 

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. 

Except for authorized law enforcement investigation and to maintain required correspondence files, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.

A persistent cookie is created when a site visitor toggles on or off the Closed Captioning of a navy.mil video. This cookie stores only the user's preferred captioning state of the video player (on or off) and it expires after 48 hours. 

The appearance of hyperlinks does not constitute endorsement by the U.S. Navy of non-U.S. Government sites or the information, products, or services contained therein.
