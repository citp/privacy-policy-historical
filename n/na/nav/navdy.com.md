**Tracking and Cookies**

In order to provide you with the Service, we often interact with third parties and use the services of third parties.  Navdy, and third parties we interact with, including our third-party service providers, may use cookies, web beacons, local shared objects (sometimes called "flash cookies"), and similar technologies in connection with your use of the Service to provide and support the Service (collectively referred to in this policy as "Cookies"). Cookies are small data files that may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our applications.  Locally shared objects or “flash cookies” are data files that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit and are a way for websites to store information for later use. Locally stored objects are different than cookies because they are stored in different parts of your computer than cookies. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data.

If Cookies are used, they may be used to collect information about you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type, preferences, data relating to content that has been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. Cookies may also be used in order to further Service features and processes, provide authentication and security for your transactions on the Service, store your preferences, facilitate relevant advertising, and help us learn more about how users engage with the Service.

We sometimes use service providers to help us provide certain products and services or to integrate other features.  These third-party providers may collect information when you view or use them, including information about you and your device or browser. They may do this using Cookies or similar technologies.  These third-party providers also may use these technologies to help share information with the Service, like how you use their website or application. To learn more about the information they collect or receive, review their privacy policies.

For example, we work with a service provided by Char Software, Inc. called Localytics “Localytics”) to collect usage data from the Navdy Display as well as our iOS and Android mobile apps in order to help us understand how you and other users are interacting with our Service.  Localytics is used to track activities within our Service such as how long you use a product or which features and functions you interact with while using the Service.  This information, including your IP address, is transmitted and stored by Localytics on servers in the United States.  For more information see Localytics’ privacy policy: http://www.localytics.com/privacy-policy/.

We also work with a service called Google Analytics provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use our website. The information generated by these cookies (including your truncated IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your, and other users’, use of our Services, compiling reports for us on Service activity and providing other services relating to Service activity and Internet usage. Please note that Google only receives your truncated IP address. This is sufficient for Google to identify (approximately) the country from which you are using our or Service, but is not sufficient to identify you, or your computer or mobile device, individually.  Google’s privacy policy is found here: <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245>.

We work with Bit Stadium GmbH (“HockeyApp”) to report any bug affecting portions of the Service.  If the Service crashes during normal use, this technology will send certain information about the incident to HockeyApp.  This information consists of the device type, OS version and certain hardware information about your mobile device, the Navdy display, and the time of the crash, the state of the application at the time of the crash, and stack traces. The information does not include your IP address or any other information that could be used to identify you or your mobile device individually, and does not include any other information from your mobile device or the Navdy display.  HockeyApp’s privacy policy is found here: <http://hockeyapp.net/privacy/>.

You can use the settings within your browser to control the cookies that are set on your computer or mobile device. However, please be aware that cookies are important to many aspects for the Service – if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to enjoy all of the features of the Service.

**Categories of Third-Party Persons or Entities With Whom Navdy May Share Your Personally Identifiable Information**

Navdy may disclose the information we collect from you to the following third parties:

Online Store.  Our online store is hosted by Shopify, Inc. (“Shopify”).  Shopify provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products to you.  Accordingly, when you submit personal information in connection with purchases made via our Service, such information is not collected by us, but rather is sent directly to Shopify.  When you purchase something using our Service, as a part of the buying and selling process, Shopify collects information from you such as your first name, last name, company name, mailing address, phone number, email address and credit card payment information. Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application. The information Shopify collects from you is governed by Shopify’s privacy policy and other policies located here: [http://www.shopify.com/data-pr...](http://www.shopify.com/data-processing/privacy-policy) and http://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy. According to these policies, Shopify protects credit card information according to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), a set of security requirements managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of the payment brands, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by merchants and service providers. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. The description above is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of Shopify’s privacy policies, and you should review the policies posted on Shopify’s site to be fully informed.

Navdy’s Affiliates. We may share some or all of your information with our parent company, subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, joint venturers or other companies under common control with us.

Aggregate Information. We may share information relating to visitors and users of our Service with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties on an aggregate basis. While this information will not identify you personally, in some instances these third parties may be able to combine this information with other data they have about you, or that they receive from third parties, in a manner that allows them to associate this aggregated data with your personal data.

Legal Requirements. Navdy may share your information with law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third parties, if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; enforce applicable provisions of the Navdy Terms of Service located at https://www.navdy.com/terms, including investigation of potential violations; detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or safety of Navdy, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.  We may dispute any third party demands to share your information when we believe, in our sole discretion, that the requests may be enforceable, overbroad, vague or lack proper authority; however, we do not commit to challenge every such demand.

Public Information. To the extent you share any information to a public audience or via a publically accessible portion of the Service, that information will be available to the public.

Unforeseen and Unpreventable Disclosure. Your information may also be disclosed to third parties in unforeseeable situations or situations that are not preventable even when commercially reasonably protections are employed, such as in the case that Navdy or the Service is subject to a hacking or other attack.

**Do Not Track**

You may be able to adjust your browser settings or other settings so that “do not track” requests are sent to the Service’s websites. We will not disable tracking technology that may be active on the Service in response to any “do not track” requests that are sent to the Service.
