## 3\. With Whom Do We Share the Information We Collect?

We may share your Personal Information with affiliates in accordance with the practices set forth in our [Consumer Privacy Policy](https://www.navyfederal.org/pdf/publications/NFCU_198_PrivacyPolicy.pdf). We do not sell your Personal Information. We may use or share your non-Personal Information to enhance your experience on our Sites, to help deliver our ads on your web browser, and to measure advertising campaign effectiveness.

## 4\. Keeping Your Information Accurate

It is important that we have accurate and up-to-date information about you.

Any changes to our policy will become effective when posted unless indicated otherwise. On May 25, 2018, new privacy regulations from the European Union, known as the GDPR, took effect. The regulations are designed to protect privacy rights of residents of EU countries. We comply with the GDPR as applicable.

## 6\. How You Can Control Your Information 

Our Sites are designed for optimal viewing with cookies enabled (cookies are small text files that collect internet traffic data). For example, cookies store your preferences for when you visit our Sites. If your web browser settings allow cookies, our Sites will utilize them. You may disable or remove cookies by accessing your web browser settings. Our Sites will still function without cookies, but some features may not work properly. Please note that due to a lack of consistent standards across browsers, our Sites may not respond to “do not track” browser settings. We do not monitor your online activities after you leave our Sites. 

We only use your Personal Information for certain purposes allowed by law (see Section 3 and refer to our [Consumer Privacy Policy](https://www.navyfederal.org/pdf/publications/NFCU_198_PrivacyPolicy.pdf)), which you cannot limit. Additionally, you cannot opt out of our sharing non-Personal Information such as your IP address and device identifier. 

You may, however, be able to opt out of certain advertisements. To learn more about a particular advertising network (including how to opt out), click on the industry group network symbol or link located on the advertisement.

## 7\. Children’s Privacy 

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under the age of 13 who use our Sites without obtaining consent from a parent or legal guardian.

## 8\. Data Sharing

Although Navy Federal does not share your Personal Information with nonaffiliated third-party companies, we are aware that you may choose to do so in order to use their services. For example, you may have authorized some third-party companies to access your Personal Information and account data to offer financial information and services such as: account aggregation (consolidating your financial account information from different sources), making payments via a website or mobile application, and tax preparation. Because these third-party companies have access to your Personal Information and account data and may use your account login credentials in order to provide the service, we recommend that you use caution when granting such access to these types of third-party companies.

Some of these third-party companies may use other companies to assist them with providing services or with accessing your Personal Information or account data. Any one or all of these companies may be storing your Personal Information or account data. Navy Federal is not responsible for the use or disclosure of any Personal Information or account data accessed by or on behalf of any company or person to whom you provide your Navy Federal login credentials or account information. We do not control the privacy, security or accuracy of your information that may be held by these third party companies which are governed by the third-party’s privacy policy and data security program. We are also not responsible for any fees associated with these third-party services.

When you provide your login credentials to your Navy Federal accounts to a third party, you will be deemed by us to have authorized all transactions or actions initiated by that third party using the access information you provided, whether or not you are aware of the specific transaction or action. 

If you decide to revoke the access authority you previously gave to a third party, we strongly recommend that you change your Navy Federal password to ensure that the party cannot continue to access your account. For security and other reasons, Navy Federal reserves the right to block or disable third-party access to any account without notice.
