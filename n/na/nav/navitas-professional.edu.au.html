<h1 class="title">Navitas Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="content">
<h3 class="dax_normal">Overview</h3>
<p>Navitas Limited (Navitas) and its Related Bodies Corporate incorporated in 
Australia are subject to the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).</p>
<p>The Privacy Act regulates how private sector entities collect, use, disclose 
and otherwise handle personal information.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy outlines how Navitas deals with the personal information 
we collect. People who deal with Navitas are entitled to expect that any 
information collected will be treated in accordance with our Australian privacy 
responsibilities and obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="dax_normal">What is personal information?</h3>
<p>Personal information includes any information or opinion about an identified 
individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable. For further 
information visit the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner 
website.</p>
<p>The types of personal information which Navitas collects may include an 
individual's name, phone number, email address, address, nationality, date of 
birth, and educational history.&nbsp; Due to the nature of the services provided 
by Navitas, some of the information we collect may be sensitive information, 
including details about an individual's race or ethnic background.&nbsp; It is 
not common practice for Navitas to collect information about an individual's 
medical history, religion, political opinion, sexual preference or criminal 
record, unless such information is required in order to process a student's 
application for admission, enrolment and education.&nbsp; Navitas will only 
collect sensitive information with an individual's consent.</p>
<p>Personal information may be collected by Navitas in a number of 
circumstances, including when an individual:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lodges an enquiry through Navitas's online enquiry service; 
  </li><li>applies for admission to a Navitas facility; 
  </li><li>registers or enrols for a class or course offered by Navitas; 
  </li><li>attends a seminar; or 
  </li><li>applies for employment with us. </li></ul>
<p>We generally collect personal information directly from the individual 
concerned, although there may be occasions when information is collected from 
third parties, such as a family member who contacts us on the individual's 
behalf, from our contractors who supply services to us, through our partner 
institutions or from a publicly maintained record.&nbsp; If an individual does 
not provide the information requested by us, we may not be able to provide them 
with our services.</p>
<p>If you provide personal information to us about someone else, you must ensure 
that you are entitled to disclose that information to us and that, without us 
taking any further steps required by privacy laws, we may collect, use and 
disclose such information for the purposes described in this Privacy 
Policy.&nbsp; For example, you should take reasonable steps to ensure the 
individual concerned is aware of the various matters detailed in this Privacy 
Policy, including our identity and how to contact us, the purposes for which we 
collect personal information, our information disclosure practices, the 
individual's right to obtain access to the information we hold about them and 
the consequences for the individual if the information is not provided.&nbsp; 
The individual must also provide the consents set out in this Privacy Policy in 
respect of how Navitas will deal with their personal information.</p>
<h3>What other information do we collect?</h3>
<p>When you look at the Navitas website, our computers record your visit and log 
the following anonymous information for statistical purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Internet Protocol address from which we receive the request 
  </li><li>the date and time our server received the request 
  </li><li>the pages, documents and files you requested 
  </li><li>the address of the resource which provided the link followed, if any, to 
  Navitas website 
  </li><li>the type of browser and, in some cases, the operating system used 
  </li><li>in some cases, data you send to our website from web forms (e.g. search 
  terms). </li></ul>
<p>Some sections of Navitas website use standard industry technologies, for 
example 'cookies', to make full use of the site.&nbsp; Navitas uses cookies to 
distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you 
with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve 
our site. Navitas will only use and disclose personal information about you that 
is collected using cookies for other purposes where we have your consent to do 
so, or as otherwise required or authorised by law.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="dax_normal">What do we do with the information?</h3>
<p>Navitas collects personal information for the primary purpose of providing 
our services to individuals.&nbsp; We may also collect personal information for 
purposes related or ancillary to the primary purpose of collection, 
including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>administering and managing the services we provide to prospective and 
  current students, including admissions, enrolment, education, billing, 
  maintaining our information technology systems, customer service and data 
  storage; 
  </li><li>marketing the services of Navitas and its related entities to prospective, 
  current and past students; 
  </li><li>hiring and managing employees and contractors; 
  </li><li>planning, monitoring, evaluating and improving our services, including 
  conducting market research and surveys and assessing customer satisfaction; 
  and 
  </li><li>otherwise communicating with you. </li></ul>
<p>Navitas will only use and disclose personal information about you for the 
purposes stated above, where we have your consent to do so, or as otherwise 
required or authorised by law.&nbsp; For example, Navitas centres may need to 
share student information with partner institutions in the course of providing 
education classes on the institution's campuses.</p>
<p>By providing us with your personal information, you consent to us using your 
information to contact you on an ongoing basis in order to provide you with 
marketing information we think would be of interest to you, including by mail, 
email, SMS and telephone.</p>
<p>Navitas may retain other companies and contractors to provide services for 
us, including entities located outside Australia, who will need to have access 
to your personal information to perform their obligations.&nbsp; Navitas may 
also use a cloud-based service to store and process personal information.&nbsp; 
By providing us with your personal information, you consent to us disclosing 
your information to entities located outside Australia for these purposes, as 
well as Navitas' related companies to allow those companies to use and disclose 
that information for the primary and ancillary purposes for which Navitas 
collects personal information stated above. In such circumstances, we are not 
responsible for a failure of the overseas recipient to comply with Australian 
privacy laws. The entities may be located in the USA, Japan and Hong Kong. For a 
full list of locations, please contact our Privacy Contact Officer.</p>
<p>Only a limited number of staff has access to the anonymous information 
collected via the Navitas website.&nbsp; The information is collated for 
analysis. It is then evaluated and published in reports that show Navitas usage 
patterns and identify popular areas of the website. This helps us to improve and 
develop the website and its services.</p>
<p>For security reasons, Navitas uses software programs to monitor network 
traffic and identify unauthorised attempts to upload or change information, or 
otherwise cause damage.</p>
<h3>Minors and privacy</h3>
<p>When Navitas has knowledge that a person under age 15 is providing personal 
information to Navitas, we require the person to obtain parental permission and 
consent for you to provide Navitas with your personal information.</p>
<h3 class="dax_normal">What won't we do with the information?</h3>
<p>Navitas will not disclose or externally publish personal information to third 
parties who are not related to Navitas with a view to allowing them to direct 
market their products or services without the relevant individual's consent.</p>
<p>No attempt will be made to identify individual users of the Navitas website 
except in the unlikely event of an investigation or legal proceedings, or where 
otherwise permitted to do so under the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>For example, Navitas will gather more extensive information than stated above 
in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>unauthorised attempts to access files other than those published on 
  Navitas website 
  </li><li>unauthorised tampering or interference with files published on Navitas 
  website 
  </li><li>unauthorised attempts by other websites to index the contents of Navitas 
  website 
  </li><li>attempts to intercept messages of other Navitas website users 
  </li><li>communications which are defamatory, abusive, vilify individuals or groups 
  or give rise to a suspicion that an offence is being committed 
  </li><li>attempts to otherwise compromise the security of the Navitas web server, 
  breach the laws of the Commonwealth or a state of Australia, or interfere with 
  the use of the Navitas website by other users.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<h3>Is data stored in a secure way?</h3>
<p>Navitas has security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse and 
alteration of information under our control, as required by law and generally 
accepted industry standards.&nbsp; However, no system is 100% secure and to the 
extent permitted by law, we exclude any liability in contract, tort or otherwise 
for any security breach.</p>

<p><strong>Navitas will only publish personal information on our website if it 
has been collected for this purpose with your knowledge and 
consent.</strong></p>
<p>When giving such consent you should be aware that information published on 
our website is accessible to millions of users from all over the world, that it
