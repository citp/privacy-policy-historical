Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one. 

Information Collected Upon Registration. If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user upon payment of $1000, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to CeoAfrica. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or if you desire to receive beneficial materials and information. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your IP address, full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile. 

**Additional Information**

Your full user name and your photo, if you decide to upload one, are displayed to people in the CeoAfrica network to enable you to connect with people on CeoAfrica, as specified in your privacy settings. Once a member, you may provide additional information in the profile section, including but not limited to your bio, your location, as well as your personal web site, if you have one. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new friends and opportunities in the CeoAfrica platform. If you activate the mobile phone options per the Terms of Service at CeoAfrica.com/terms.php, we will collect your cellular phone number account information. You will receive notifications on your cellular phone account in a number of cases, such as when a new CeoAfrica member comes on board, or when a CeoAfrica adds you as a friend or sends you a message.

In addition, we may use your contact information to update you on Business News, and provide you with information about investment opportunities in Africa and the rest of the world. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.
