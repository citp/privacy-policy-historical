Collection and Use of Information by NaijaJobsLink.com

In certain areas of NaijaJobsLink.com, such as those in which you register, complete a profile, apply to a job posting, create a new account, or enter a NaijaJobsLink.com contest or promotion, we may request that you provide us with certain personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, telephone number, resume, credit card number, address, billing information, and other personal information from which your identity may be discernible. You may always choose not to provide such personally identifiable information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or particular content.

In other areas of the Site, we collect or may collect demographic information that is not unique to you, including your age, gender, profession, and ZIP code.

We also collect or may collect information about your use of NaijaJobsLink.com, including what areas of the Site you visit, what services you access and what links or advertisements you click on. Moreover, we may collect information about your computer hardware and software. This information may include your browser type, operating system, IP address, Internet Service Provider, access times, and referring website addresses. While we may be able to determine your geographic location from this information, it is not linked to your personal information.

From time to time we may provide you with the opportunity to submit behavioural, descriptive, cultural, preferential, and/or lifestyle information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you choose to furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you thereby give your consent to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. For example, such information may be used to determine if you are interested in receiving e-mail or other communications about particular products or services.

If you choose to use our online reference service to request a personal or professional reference statement, we may ask you to provide the name and e-mail address of an individual/s. We will automatically send this individual a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit NaijaJobsLink.com to provide a reference statement that will be associated with your profile. We do not store this information.

Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties

We will not disclose your personal information to third parties, or your combined personal and demographic information or information about your use of NaijaJobsLink.com (including the areas you visit or the services you access), except as set forth below.

  1. We disclose information if requested to do so by a governmental entity, if legally required to do so, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (b) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (c) protect the personal safety of users or the public; or (d) prevent a crime or protect national security.
  2. We disclose information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if at the time you register with NaijaJobsLink.com, you state that you would like to receive information about products, opportunities, or services of third parties, we may supply your contact information to third parties including but not limited to data aggregators, employers, recruiters, marketers, and/or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We use data we have about you (such as the skills, professional experience and preferences you have expressed) to determine whether you might want to receive information about the products, opportunities, or services of a particular third party.
  3. We will transfer and/or disclose your information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of consolidation, merger, or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In the event we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, either we or our trustees in bankruptcy may license, sell, or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. You will be notified of any sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party via e-mail or through a public notice posted on NaijaJobsLink.com.
  4. We may, from time to time, disclose information to companies and individuals we contract to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include, but are not limited to, analyzing data, processing credit card payments, hosting our web servers, providing marketing assistance, and/or providing customer service. These individuals and companies will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their designated functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.



Other Uses of Information

We may share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to NaijaJobsLink.com with partners, advertisers, clients, and other third parties. We may also aggregate, on an anonymous basis, data regarding education, age, job qualifications, experience level, or other information relevant to the competition or job search among seekers for any such job. Such data may be made available to other job seekers or employers.

If you apply to a job posted on NaijaJobsLink.com, where permitted by applicable law, you may be asked to provide information on your race, gender, or other protected status. For reporting and record-keeping requirements, some employers are required by law to gather this information from job applicants. If provided, this information will be used by employers only in accordance with applicable law and will not be used in making negative employment decisions. All race, gender, or other protected status information will be kept separate from your expression of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this information is strictly voluntary, and if you choose not to provide this information you will not be subject to any adverse treatment or action.

Information gathered on co-hosted job posting pages (where jobs posted on other websites are pulled in and displayed on NaijaJobsLink.com using iFrames) may become the property of NaijaJobsLink.com and the other company. In such cases, we are not responsible for that company’s use of your personal or demographic information, and the use of such information by the other company will be subject to the privacy statement of that company.

Personal Information on Job Seeker Profiles and Resumes

Information job seekers provide during the registration process will automatically be transferred to your online Profile. You will be asked to upload a copy of your resume and provide additional information to compete your Profile including, but not limited to, contact information, work history, education, and skills all of which is optional.

NaijaJobsLink.com provides you the following options regarding the accessibility of your online Profile:

  1. If you allow your Profile to be “Public”, portions of your Profile, but not your contact information or resume, may be accessible to the public. However, only registered employers and recruiters, will have access to your contact information and resume file.
  2. You can create a “Private” Profile and store your resume in our database without allowing it to be searchable by potential employers. Not allowing your Profile or resume to be searchable means that employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product, but you can use it to apply for a job online.
  3. If you apply to a job posting on NaijaJobsLink.com and have a “Private” Profile and resume, the employer to whom you send your resume will be able to access your contact information.



By visiting NaijaJobsLink.com, signing in to your account and navigating to My NaijaJobsLink and then My Profile, you can choose to make your Profile “Public” or “Private”. We strive to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) only to paying hiring managers, headhunters, employers, recruiters, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies as required by law, but cannot guarantee that third parties will not gain access to this database.

We are not responsible for the use made of our clients’ resumes by third parties who access resumes while they are in our searchable database. The portions of your searchable Profile (not your contact information) that are publicly available on NaijaJobsLink.com are accessible to any visitor. You may, at any time, edit any information in your Profile. If you would like to cancel your account and remove your Profile from NaijaJobsLink.com, please [contact us](http://naijajobslink.com/contact/).
