**Cookies**

Our wordpress-based site uses cookies to record session information and store non-identifiable visitor preferences.

Naijastories may obtain IP addresses from users either at registration or on individual visits. We will use this information to monitor and prevent fraud, and diagnose problems.

We do not guarantee the security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site. So, in addition to our efforts, we encourage our users to use unique passwords and to make sure that they are the only users of their sign-in.

**How we use data**

We collect aggregate information on site registrations, what pages our members access or visit, and information you volunteer, such as survey and/or poll information.

to notify users about updates to our site  
When legally required to do so, we will disclose user information at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation.
