			<p>This site is owned and operated by Nabbr.com Corp ("Nabbr" or "Nabbr.com"). We understand you value your privacy. At Nabbr, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. This statement governs information you provide to us or we learn from your use of this web site and tells you how we may collect, use, and in some instances share this information.</p>
			<p><b>Information Nabbr Collects</b><br>
			Nabbr gathers two types of information about this website's users:<br>
			· Personal information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions, such as email, survey information, and online registration forms to Nabbr. Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, company name, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card information such as the credit card number, card verification value, and the billing address. The types and amount of personal information collected for these activities will vary depending on the activity.<br>
			
· Nabbr also gathers non-personal information through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This non-personal information collected includes click-throughs, IP addresses, and usage data. This non-personal information allows us to better tailor our content to site users' needs. Usage Tracking We track product usage data and user traffic patterns throughout our site to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service. In addition, we track click-through information, including IP addresses, to our site from the reports and emails we sent to our customers. This is done to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and to discourage fraudulent use.</p>
			<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
			A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are required to use the Nabbr service. We use cookies to record current session information. Additionally, if you choose the 'remember me' option, you are issued a permanent cookie. A permanent cookie is one that remains on the hard drive after the browser application has been closed. Children Consistent with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requiring parental consent. Any person who provides their personal information to Nabbr through this web site represents that they are 13 years of age or older.</p>
			<p><b>Nabbr's Use of Information</b><br>
			We use the personal information about you stored in our member database in various ways. We use the personal information collected to provide you with our products and services. In addition, the personal information collected is used for identification and authentication, billing, and to contact you. Finally, information we gather may be used to otherwise improve our services.</p> 
			<p><b>Nabbr's Transfer and Information Sharing Policy</b><br>
			We do not share personal information collected on this web site with third parties for their direct marketing. We provide personal information to trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. Nabbr does not otherwise share personal information about site users with third parties unless doing so is appropriate to carry out a user's request or it reasonably believes that doing so is legally required or is in Nabbr's interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others. If Nabbr should ever file for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to or merge with another entity, information Nabbr receives from you from this Site is a Nabbr asset and may be transferred.</p>
