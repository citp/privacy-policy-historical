Cookies and Similar Technologies

When you view or interact with our sites, electronic communications and online advertisements (collectively, "sites and ads"), we automatically receive and store certain information about your computer or device and how you engage with our sites and ads. 

**Types of Information Collected Automatically**

When you view or interact with our sites and ads, we may automatically receive certain information. This information includes: 

  * Log information. Log information refers to information that is automatically sent by your web browser or device (or otherwise automatically collected by us) each time you view or interact with our sites and ads. Log information may include the site requested (for example, the MondelezInternational.com website); date and time of your request; referring URL (i.e., the website you came from); your device's IP address; location data derived from your device's IP address; browser type; browser language; device operating system; device hardware and other characteristics; device event information (for example, crash data); information regarding your use of our sites (for example, pages viewed, features used, number of clicks, time spent on a particular page); data contained in cookies; and related device and usage data. Log information is automatically recorded by our servers each time you view or interact with our sites and ads.
  

  * Device information. Device information refers to device-specific information that we automatically collect when you view or interact with our sites and ads. Device information may include your device type and model; device operating system and version; unique device and advertising identifiers; mobile network information; and related device information. To learn more about the information your device may make available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
  

  * Cookie data. Cookie data refers to the small text file(s) that are sent to or read by our servers when you view or interact with our sites and ads. Cookie data may include user preferences and other information.
  

  * Local storage data. Local storage data refers to data stored locally on your browser or device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (for example, HTML 5, Flash) and application data caches (i.e., a data repository on a device used for storing data locally in connection with a particular application). As with cookie data, local storage data may be sent back to or read by our servers when you view or interact with our sites and ads.
  

  * Statistical identifiers. Statistical identifiers refer to identifiers created using your device information and certain log information. This information, collectively, makes your web browser or device sufficiently distinct for our servers or similar systems to reasonably determine that they are encountering the same browser or device over time. Statistical identifiers enable us to uniquely identify your web browser or device for the same purposes as cookies.



In this privacy statement, the information described above is collectively referred to as "device and usage data." 

**Overview of Cookies and Similar Technologies**

We use various technologies to collect device and usage data, including cookies and similar technologies. 

  * Cookies. Cookies are small text files that are sent to and stored by your browser or device when you view or interact with our sites and ads. These cookies are then sent back unchanged to us each time you view or interact with our sites and ads in order for us to recognize your web browser or device. Cookies are used by us for a number of legitimate purposes, such as authenticating users; session tracking and storing information about specific users (for example, website preferences, buying habits); analyzing traffic to our sites; tracking the number and frequency of ads that have been shown to specific browsers or devices; and related purposes.
  
There are different types of cookies. Cookies served by the entity that operates the website you are using or viewing are called first party cookies (for example, cookies served by Mondelēz Global when you view or interact with our sites are first party cookies). Cookies served by entities that are not operating the website you are viewing or interacting with are called third party cookies (for example, cookies served by our online service providers when you use or view our sites, such as Google Analytics cookies, are third party cookies). Cookies may also endure for different periods of time. Session cookies only last as long as your web browser is open, and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are persistent cookies, meaning they survive after your browser is closed (for example, to recognize your browser or device when you revisit our sites). 
  * Pixel tags. Pixel tags (also called web beacons, clear GIFs and action tags) are small blocks of code installed on our sites and ads for a number of legitimate purposes, such as to allow us to track activity on our sites (for example, when e-mails are opened or content is viewed); to allow our online service providers to serve cookies on our sites and receive relevant device and usage data; and other purposes relating to the monitoring and analysis of the use and performance of our sites and ads.
  

  * Local storage. Local storage refers generally to the storage of data locally on your browser or device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (for example, HTML 5, Flash) and application data caches.
  

  * Software Development Kits. Software development kits (also called SDKs) function like third party cookies and pixel tags, but operate in the mobile app context where cookies and pixel tags cannot function as effectively. Instead, we may install pieces of code (the SDK) provided by our online service providers (for example, third party advertising companies, ad networks and analytics providers) in our mobile apps in order for our online service providers to collect and analyze relevant device and usage data.
  

  * Server logs. Server logs refer to the servers used by us to receive and store device and usage data.



In this privacy statement, the cookies and other technologies described above are collectively referred to as "cookies and similar technologies." For more information about cookies and similar technologies generally, please visit [ here](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). 

**Purposes and Uses of Cookies and Similar Technologies**

Cookies and similar technologies allow us and our online service providers to collect and track device and usage data. The following table identifies and describes the different types of cookies and similar technologies used with our sites and ads, and why we use them. 

Cookie Types | Purposes and Uses  
---|---  
**Operations & System Management** | Our sites utilize first- and third-party cookies and similar technologies that are necessary in order to operate our business and manage our sites and other systems, including authenticating and verifying users of our sites; preventing fraud and securing our sites; protecting intellectual property rights; fulfilling product and service orders, and delivering and billing for such products and services; complying with applicable laws and industry standards; and protecting our business and the safety of others.  
**Features & User Preferences** | Our sites utilize first- and third-party cookies and similar technologies to provide enhanced features and remember user preferences on our sites and ads, including identifying return users when visiting our sites (for example, to prefill fields); keeping track of user preferences, interests and past items viewed or utilized (for example, preferred language, saved items); and providing social plugins that allow users to interact with social media services (for example, Facebook, Twitter) via our sites.  
**Analytics, Product Development & Market Research** | Our sites utilize first- and third-party cookies and similar technologies for analytics, product development and market research purposes, including analyzing how individuals arrive at and engage with our sites and ads; tracking and measuring the performance and effectiveness of our sites and ads; optimizing the location of ads, features and other content on our sites and third party websites; statistical reporting in connection with activity on our sites and ads; analyzing user preferences and behaviors, and market characteristics and trends, in order to develop and improve our products, sites and ads; segmenting audiences to test features of our sites and ads; and conducting research about our consumers, products and sites.  
**Advertising & Targeting** | Our sites utilize first- and third-party cookies and similar technologies to deliver, track and measure ads both on and off our sites, including ads relevant to your interests (for example, ads based on your past interaction with our sites, ads based on predictions about your interests derived from your activities on different websites over time); and ads based on your location, demographics, or computer or device characteristics. This includes tracking and measuring the reach and frequency of ads, and regulating the delivery of such ads (for example, capping the number of times you see a particular ad). For example, we may use cookies and similar technologies to deliver relevant ads based on your location; or to group users that share a common interest into audience segments and deliver ads that may be of interest to users within a given segment; or to deliver our ads on third-party websites through a common form of online advertising known as "retargeting" or "remarketing." Retargeting works by serving ads on one website based on an individual's activities on a different website (for example, if you view a product on our site, such as Oreo® cookies, you may later see ads for Oreo® cookies when you visit a third-party website). To do this, we allow our online service providers, such as advertising agencies and ad networks, to place their own third-party cookies when users view or interact with our sites, allowing these online service providers to recognize users who have previously visited our sites. When these users visit a third-party website that includes features provided by our online service providers (for example, where our online service providers have purchased ad space), these online service providers can then recognize the users' interest in our products and services and deliver one of our ads on the third-party website.  
  
**Collection and Use of Device and Usage Data by Our Online Service Providers**

Some of our online service providers may use third-party cookies and similar technologies on unaffiliated websites and apps that include features provided by these online service providers, or unaffiliated websites and apps where these online service providers have purchased ad space. These online service providers may combine device and usage data collected through our sites and ads with device and usage data collected on unaffiliated websites and apps, and any other data maintained by such online service providers (including identifiable data), for the purposes described above and as otherwise set forth in this privacy statement. Please note that this privacy statement applies only to information collected by our online service providers through our sites and ads, and information shared with us by our online service providers. All other information collected or obtained outside our sites and ads by our online service providers is subject to the privacy practices and policies of the respective online service providers. Please refer to their websites' privacy and data sharing statements for more information. 

Subject to our approval, we may allow our online service providers to collect non-identified (i.e., device and usage data that does not identify a specific individual) or aggregated device and usage data through our sites and ads for their own legitimate business purposes. Please refer to our online service providers' privacy and data sharing statements found on their respective websites for more information regarding their collection and use of non-identified and aggregated data.

Google places its own cookies when individuals visit our sites that enable Google to recognize individuals who have previously visited our sites. When these individuals visit a third-party website on which Google has ad space, Google can then recognize these individuals' interest in our products and services and deliver one of our ads. More information on Google's Remarketing with Google Analytics can be found [here](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/ads/). If you would like to opt-out of having your information collected and used by us and our online service providers as described herein, please use the Google Analytics opt-out available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

If you would like to opt-out of having your information collected and used by us and our online service providers as described herein, please visit [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) if you are in the United States; or [here](http://youronlinechoices.eu/) if you are in Europe; or [here](http://youradchoices.ca/choices/) if you are in Canada.

**Web Browser Do Not Track (DNT) Headers**

Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites with which the browser communicates. Our sites do not currently respond to such "do-not-track" signals. 

**Social Media Plugins**

Our sites may use social media plugins (for example, the Facebook "Like" button, "Share to Twitter" button, "Google+" button) to enable you to easily interact with certain social media websites (for example, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn) and share information with others. When you visit our sites, the operators of the available social media plugins can place a cookie on your device enabling such operators to recognize individuals who have previously visited our sites. If you are logged into these social media websites while visiting our sites, the social media plugins allow the relevant social media websites to receive information that you have visited our sites or other information. The social media plugins also allow the applicable social media websites to share information about your activities on our sites with other users of the social media website. For example, Facebook Social Plugins allow Facebook to show your "Likes" and comments on our sites to your Facebook friends. Facebook Social Plugins also allow you to see your friends' Facebook activity on our sites. We do not control any of the content from the social media plugins. For more information about social media plugins from other social media websites, please refer to those websites' privacy and data sharing statements.
