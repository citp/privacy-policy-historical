	<h2>Respecting your privacy and the law</h2>

<p>The privacy of your personal information has always been important to us at the National Australia Bank Group ("<strong>Group</strong>"). We are committed to respecting your right to privacy and protecting your personal information. We are bound by the National Privacy Principles in the <em>Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth)</em> and any relevant Health Privacy Principles under State legislation <sup>1</sup>, as well as other applicable laws and codes affecting your personal information. Our staff are trained to respect your privacy in accordance with our standards, policies and procedures.</p>

<p>The Group is the National Australia Bank Limited and its subsidiaries such as MLC Ltd. It includes all our banking, financing, funds management, financial planning, superannuation, insurance, broking and e-commerce organisations.</p>

<p class="smallprint"><sup>1</sup> For example, those contained in the Health Records Act 2001 (Vic), Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002 (NSW) or the privacy provisions contained in Part 2 of the Health Records (Privacy and Access) Act 1997 (ACT).</p>

<h2>About this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we manage your personal information. It also describes generally the sorts of personal information held and for what purposes, and how that information is collected, held, used and disclosed.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all your dealings with us whether at one of our branches, through our call centres, via our websites or an advisor. However, depending on the Group organisation with which you deal, further privacy information may apply in addition to the matters discussed in this Privacy Policy (see, for example, <a href="#websites">Our Websites</a> below).</p>

<p>We encourage you to check our websites regularly for any updates to our Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Collecting your personal information</h2>

<p>If you are acquiring or have acquired a product or service from a Group organisation, it will collect and hold your personal information for the purposes of:</p>

<ul>
<li>providing you with the relevant product or service (including assessing your application and identifying you)</li>

<li>managing and administering the product or service</li>

<li>protecting against fraud where it is a banking and finance, or insurance, product or service.</li>
</ul>

<p>Group organisations may also collect your personal information for the purpose of letting you know about products or services from across the Group that might better serve your financial, e-commerce and lifestyle needs or promotions or other opportunities in which you may be interested.</p>

<p>The information collected may include your name, postal or email address, date of birth, financial details, tax file number, health information or other information the organisation considers necessary.</p>

<p>We will, if it is reasonable or practicable to do so, collect your personal information from you. This may happen when you fill out a product or service application or an administrative form (eg a change of address form) or when you give us personal information over the telephone or counter, or through a Group organisation’s website.</p>

<p>In certain cases we collect your personal information from third parties. For example, we may need to collect personal information from a credit reporting agency, your representative (such as a legal adviser), your financial adviser, your employer or publicly available sources of information or any of the other organisations identified below under "Using and Disclosing Your Personal Information".</p>

<h2>Using and disclosing your personal information</h2>

<p>In line with modern business practices common to many financial institutions and to meet your specific needs (such as where you have a financial adviser) we may disclose your personal information to the organisations described below. Where your personal information is disclosed we will seek to ensure that the information is held, used or disclosed consistently with the National Privacy Principles, any relevant Health Privacy Principles under State legislation and other applicable privacy laws and codes.</p>

<h3>The relevant organisations are those</h3>

<ul>
<li>involved in providing, managing or administering your product or service such as third party suppliers, other Group organisations, loyalty and affinity program partners, printers, posting services, call centres, lenders&nbsp;mortgage&nbsp;insurers and our advisers</li>

<h2 id="lmi">Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)</h2>

<p>If NAB decides it is required, NAB will apply to the Insurer described below for LMI&nbsp; for the loan that that I/we have applied for (including any additional finance provided under an existing Bank loan contract) (the “loan”).&nbsp; NAB and the Insurer may exchange information about me/us and the Insurer may collect information about me/us to enable the Insurer to decide whether to:</p>

<ul>
<li>insure NAB; or</li>

<li>assess the risk of insuring NAB in respect of the loan; or assess the risk of default by me/us on the loan (if insured by the Insurer); or</li>

<li>assess the risk of a guarantor for the loan being unable to meet their liabilities under the guarantee in respect of mortgage finance given by NAB to me/us (the assessment purposes); and also to comply with legislative requirements and for any purpose in connection with the LMI contract between NAB and the Insurer.</li>
</ul>

<p>I/we authorise the Insurer to obtain a credit report containing either personal or commercial information about me/us from a credit reporting agency for any of the assessment purposes.</p>

<p>I/we understand that:</p>

<ul>
<li>if my/our information is not provided to the Insurer, NAB may not be in a position to provide the loan;</li>

<li>the Insurer will collect and use my/our information for the purpose of assessing NAB's insurance application, for any other assessment or administration purposes, for purposes connected with the LMI contract between the Insurer and NAB (including any variation to, or claim under, the policy, or enforcing the mortgage relating to the loan) and for the Insurer’s internal management, risk assessment and compliance purposes;</li>

<li>the Insurer will usually disclose my/our information for these purposes to its related companies, NAB, a guarantor or a potential guarantor, reinsurers, credit reporting agencies, its service providers, its agents, contractors and external advisers, my referees (including my employer), my/our legal and financial advisers, mercantile agents (if I/we default on the loan), government and other regulatory bodies, rating agencies, payment systems operators and other financial institutions, securitisers and credit providers;</li>
