# NACHA Privacy Policy | NACHA

### NACHA – The Electronic Payments Association (“NACHA”) is committed to safeguarding your privacy.  This Web site adheres to the following policy for ensuring the privacy of any personally identifiable information that may be collected through it.

#### This policy addresses:

  * Your visit to the NACHA.org Web site,
  * The information that NACHA collects from visitors and the personal information that you submit to NACHA to access services through this Web site,
  * How collected and personal information is used,
  * When personal information may be shared with third parties, and
  * Security of information.



#### Your Web Site Visits and Information We Collect

You do not need to provide any personal information to visit public sections of this Web site.  To evaluate this Web site and improve our service to you, our web servers may automatically collect usage data, such as Internet provider address, browser type and access time.

#### Collecting Information

This Web site will only collect personally identifiable information from you if you voluntarily supply it (e.g., membership and conference registrations, purchasing NACHA’s products, enrollment in NACHA rule-making or other programs, surveys, etc.).  NACHA is the administrator of this Web site and the only organization that uses the information collected on this Web site. NACHA does not sell or rent information from this Web site.  NACHA does provide the contact information for conference attendees to exhibitors and sponsors at NACHA’s conferences; however, conference attendees have the option of opting out of this distribution of their contact information.

#### Usage of Collected Information

We use industry standard software to create summary statistics of the Web site usage data we collect, which may then be used to highlight what our visitors find interesting, to improve the Web site design specifications, to identify system performance issues and for other internal purposes.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Web site. Data gathered from logging your IP address is not tied to your personal information and is not used to identify you.

#### Cookies

Like most Web sites, our server may place a “cookie,” or small file, in the browser of a visitor's computer. This cookie will assign a user a unique number that allows this Web site to save information so that the information does not need to be re-entered and makes it more convenient for you to use the Web site.  Data on the Web site usage we collect using cookies is not tied to your personal information and is only used in aggregate form.  At no time will this cookie reveal to others any information about you.

####  Information You Submit

If you register to access various services on the Web site, you may be asked to complete online registration forms and submit personal information such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, payment method and personal preference information.  You may be asked to confirm enrollment or your identity by entering a User ID and password, clicking on “acceptance buttons,” or other methods to verify your identity.  You also may be asked to submit additional personal information or financial information in order to use certain specific services.

####  **How We Use Your Information**

The personal information you provide not only enables you to access various services offered on the Web site, but also enables us to provide you with better service generally.  We may use this information to contact you to respond to an inquiry we receive from you or to keep you informed about NACHA and its services.  If you choose to communicate with NACHA by e-mail, then e-mail from NACHA to you will be considered to be sent with your consent and will be accessible to anyone who has access to your e-mail.

We may collect e-mail addresses to improve our service to our members and Web site users. In some cases, we may contact you to let you know about new products or services.  If you do not wish to be contacted by us for this purpose, or you believe you are receiving our communications in error or no longer want to receive them, you may inform us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in any e-mail from NACHA marketing a product or service.  We will discontinue this type of contact with you within [10] days after we receive your e-mail.

We request that you protect the confidentiality of any User ID and password you use to access any of your services online.  You are responsible for all activity on the Web site accessed by your User ID and password.  Access by NACHA’s employees or consultants to any personal information you provide is limited to only information necessary to provide the business service offered and to allow employees or consultants to perform their duties for NACHA.

To provide you with services offered on the Web site, or to complete transactions or requests you initiate on the Web site, we may transfer you to outside services provided by third-party operators.  In certain instances, the third-party content may be “framed” in such a way that it appears that you are still on NACHA’s Web site.  In such cases, we will have agreements with those third parties whose Web sites you may be transferred to, under which the third parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and to use it only to help us serve you.

####  Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

Other than as set forth herein, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your written consent (which consent may be obtained electronically, such as by e-mail), unless we reasonably believe the disclosure is essential to the conduct of the company’s business or to provide services to you, including but not limited to where such disclosure is required by law, or if we believe such action is necessary in order to:  (1) conform to the requirements of the law or comply with legal process served upon us; (2) protect or defend our legal rights or property, this Web site, or our users; (3) investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of the terms and conditions for using this Web site; or (4) resolve customer disputes or inquiries.

We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include processing credit card payments, and delivering packages.  They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.  We do not provide your personal information to third parties for telemarketing, e-mail or direct mail solicitation.  When we contract with other companies to market or advertise products for NACHA, we require that those companies also protect your personal information.

####  Links

While browsing the Web site, you may encounter hypertext links to other third-party operated Web sites.  These other third-party Web sites may send their own cookies to you, log your IP address and otherwise collect data or solicit personal information.  NACHA DOES NOT CONTROL AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT THIRD PARTIES DO IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR WEB SITES, OR HOW THEY HANDLE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.  PLEASE EXERCISE CAUTION AND CONSULT THE PRIVACY POLICIES POSTED ON EACH THIRD-PARTY WEB SITE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

####  Security

Our policies and procedures limit access to personal information to those with a business reason to know such information.

NACHA employs Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the transmission of nonpublic personally identifiable financial and transaction information over the Internet.  NACHA also utilizes additional security devices, such as firewalls, security patches and anti-virus programs, to protect nonpublic personally identifiable information.  Access to nonpublic personally identifiable financial information is limited, through password protection devices and physical safeguards, to authorized employees as necessary to perform the requested transaction.  We reveal only partial digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.  Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.  However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality or security of your browser or any communication transmitted or accessible over the Internet. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

NACHA works to maintain the privacy of any personally identifiable information (name, mailing address, e-mail address, etc.) that may be collected though our Web site.  This Web site has security measures in place; however, NACHA does not represent, warrant or guarantee that personal information will be protected against unauthorized access, loss, misuse or alterations.  Similarly, NACHA disclaims liability for personal information submitted through this Web site.  Users are hereby advised that they submit such personal information at their own risk.

####  Changes to Policy

NACHA reserves the right to change this policy at any time.  Please review the contents of this Privacy Policy frequently, as we may amend it from time to time to reflect changes in our services and our policies relating to data privacy.  Amendments will become effective when posted on the Web site. NACHA will not provide you with a notice of any change in this Web site policy.  It is your responsibility to monitor and review any updates to this Privacy Policy.  Your continued use of this Web site, or online services provided by NACHA, after such posting will be deemed your acceptance of these changes to our Privacy Policy.
