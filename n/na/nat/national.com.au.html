<p><strong>Respecting your privacy and the law</strong></p>

<p>The privacy of your personal information has always been important to us at the National Australia Bank Group <strong>(“Group”)</strong>.&nbsp; We are committed to respecting your right to privacy and protecting your personal information.&nbsp; We are bound by the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) and any relevant Health Privacy Principles under State legislation , as well as other applicable laws and codes affecting your personal information.

<p><strong>About this Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we manage your personal information. It also describes generally the sorts of personal information held and for what purposes, and how that information is collected, held, used and disclosed.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all your dealings with us whether at one of our branches, through our call centres, via our websites or an advisor. However, depending on the Group organisation with which you deal, further privacy information may apply in addition to the matters discussed in this Privacy Policy (see, for example, "<strong>Our Websites</strong> " below).</p>
