####  3\. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

We collect two basic types of information from you and about you – Personal Information and Anonymous Information. We may use Personal and Anonymous Information to create a third type of information – Aggregate Information.

We collect information in different ways. We collect information that you give to us. For example, if you register with us, contact us for information, or participate in a promotion.

####  5\. DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION.

We may use third party service providers to perform certain services on behalf of the Sites, such as web site hosting, accepting job applications, providing web site usage analytics, sending email or other communications, providing marketing assistance and data analysis, providing consumer affairs services, fulfilling and processing orders, or performing other administrative services. We may provide these service providers with access to your Personal Information so that they can carry out the services they are performing for you or for Schwabe North America. Some of these service providers may collect information on the Sites directly from you on our behalf; in such cases, these service providers are not permitted to use your Personal Information for their own use.

You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from one or more third parties. If you agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly. You also may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or third party application, that we share information about you with a third party, and we will typically do so under those circumstances.

We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (collectively, a “Promotion”) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.

We may also disclose your Personal Information: i) as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; ii) when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; or iii) if Schwabe North America is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets.

####  6\. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

We collect information, and authorize our third party vendors to collect information, about users over time across our Sites and for other services. To do this, we and/or our third party vendors use several common tracking tools. These may include Cookies, Web Beacons, Flash Cookies, and similar technologies.

We may use these cookies and tracking technologies:

To recognize new or past customers.

  * To store your password if you are registered to our Site.
  * To improve our Sites.
  * To serve you with interest-based or targeted advertising
  * To observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.
  * To better understand the interests of our customers and our Site visitors.
  * In connection with an email delivery and marketing company to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Pixel tags and cookies are used in those email messages and at our Site to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising, how our visitors use our Site and to enable us to provide more focused and subsequent email marketing communications to you.



Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Site are served by third-parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with Web Beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Site. The information they collect may be associated with your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content, which is often referred to as remarketing.

While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising services, some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may want to visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. You may also want to visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an “opt-out” by participating companies in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program. Please note that these companies may still collect information when you are online and opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while visiting the Sites and elsewhere online.

####  7\. DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURES

At this time, there are no worldwide uniform or consistent industry standards or definition for responding to, processing, or communicating "Do Not Track" signals. As a result, the Site is unable to respond to "Do Not Track" signals. You can refer to the instructions in your browser to make sure the appropriate settings are selected, and to set your preferences with respect to "Do Not Track" signals.

####  8\. SECURITY AND RETENTION

Schwabe North America has reasonable technical and organizational security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control. However, Schwabe North America cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those security measures. Although we cannot guarantee that our systems are 100% secure 100% of the time, we periodically update our technology in order to improve the protection of customer information.

We retain personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We also keep information as otherwise required or permitted by law.

####  9\. WE STORE INFORMATION BOTH IN AND OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

Information we collect from you may be transferred to, or stored at, a destination in the United States or another destination outside of United States. It may be processed by staff operating in these locations who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. If you live outside of the United States, you understand and agree that we may transfer your information to the United States. U.S. laws may not afford the same level or protection as those in your country.

####  10\. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

This Privacy Policy, and Schwabe North America's collection and use of customer information, shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of Wisconsin. Any disputes arising out of this Privacy Policy shall be adjudicated in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin or a federal court of competent jurisdiction in the Eastern District of the State of Wisconsin.

####  11\. GOVERNING LANGUAGE

Any translation of this Privacy Policy is done for local requirements and in the event of a dispute between the English and any non-English versions, the English version of this Privacy Policy shall govern.
