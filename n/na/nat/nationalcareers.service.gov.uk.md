# Privacy and cookies | National Careers Service

## Privacy

The National Careers Service is funded and managed by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), an executive agency of the Department for Education (DfE). For the purposes of relevant data protection legislation, the DfE is the data controller for processed personal information. 

This page explains how we use and protect the personal information that we collect from you when you use the National Careers Service. 

You can get detailed information on how we handle your personal information by visiting the [ESFA: privacy notice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-privacy-notice).

### How we use your personal information

We collect your personal information so that the DfE can provide this service, which includes:

  * the National Careers Service website
  * services delivered through the website
  * our national telephone helpline
  * the local area careers advisory services, who provide face-to-face advice



When you use the National Careers Service, we collect personal information:

  * to help us provide the services you’ve requested
  * to provide statistical information to partner organisations
  * for evidence and to support payments to organisations delivering careers advice on our behalf



In addition, if you give your consent, we will collect your personal information:

  * for customer satisfaction surveys
  * to monitor our performance against our equality and diversity standards
  * to make sure we are targeting our service to meet the needs of priority groups



### How to withdraw your consent

If you choose not to allow us to collect additional information, you will still receive the same level of service.

If you do provide this extra information, you can choose to withdraw your consent at any time. You can do this if you:

  * have an online account - sign in, go to ‘Your account’, and in the ‘Manage your account - Your details’ section change your marketing preferences
  * call an adviser on 0800 100 900 - tell them you wish to withdraw your consent for customer satisfaction surveys, and your ethnicity and disability information as appropriate
  * speak to a local adviser by phone or face to face - tell them you wish to withdraw your consent for customer satisfaction surveys, and your ethnicity and disability information as appropriate



### Where we collect personal information

Personal information is provided directly by you to the National Careers Service when you:

  * talk to us on the phone or face to face
  * use our website or webchat
  * send us emails, text messages or online messages



We may collect personal information about you from other systems, or organisations funded by the ESFA and from:

  * the [Find an apprenticeship](https://www.gov.uk/apply-apprenticeship) service
  * the Department for Work and Pensions, if you've been referred by Jobcentre Plus
  * organisations that pass on your details, so that we can make contact with you



### Where we share your information

We may share your personal information with other services run by the ESFA and partner organisations, where the law allows it or we have a legal obligation to do so. This is to support the delivery of careers advice and guidance services to you.

We may share information with the following:

  * organisations working on behalf of local careers advice services
  * organisations who introduce you to us, so that we can update them about your progress
  * referral organisations, for example ones that we think may be able to offer you specialist support
  * Ofsted, so that they can check the quality of advice given to you by the National Careers Service
  * market research companies, who check how satisfied you are with the service you’ve received - though only if you’ve agreed to this



### How long we keep your personal information

We will only keep your information for as long as is necessary.

We may need to keep some of your personal information for up to 6 years after you stop using the service to satisfy our contractual audit requirements. Personal Information kept for this reason will be restricted to a minimum and is to provide confirmation of payments to organisations who deliver careers advice services on our behalf. 

Your information will be held securely and destroyed when it is no longer required.
