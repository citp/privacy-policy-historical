Here are some tips to help you ensure that your details are entered correctly: 

  1. **First and last name:** Your name must be entered exactly as it is printed on your card and statement. If this includes a middle initial, this should be entered along with your first name, that is: _First Name_ : Dominic A _Last Name_ : Pettit
  2. **Address** : This must be entered as it appears in your credit-card records.
  3. **State/Province** : Only complete this field if you have entered 'US/Canada' as your country.
  4. **Telephone number** : Non-numeric characters are ignored by the verification system, and consequently it will not matter if you insert hyphens, spaces or leave blank spaces in between the numerals.
  5. **Credit card number** : Non-numeric characters are ignored by the verification system, and consequently it will not matter if you insert hyphens, spaces or leave blank spaces in between the numerals.

**Information about secure ordering online**

We are committed to ensuring the security and privacy of information supplied by our customers. The site uses a secure server that encrypts all your credit-card information to ensure that no one else can view the details.
