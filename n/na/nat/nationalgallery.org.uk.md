## How do we use your information and what is our legal basis for processing it?

We will only process your information if we have a legal basis for doing so under current UK data protection legislation, including:

    * To process payments;
    * To fulfil orders for exhibition tickets or other events or services; or
    * To provide you with Membership benefits, or patrons' benefits, which you are contractually entitled to receive.


  * **Where we are required by law to process your information** , for example: 
    * To make a Gift Aid claim.


  * **Where we have your consent to process your information** , for example:  

    * Where you have agreed to receive email updates in relation to the Gallery;

Where you have given consent to the processing of your data you may withdraw it at any time. See below ‘What rights do you have in relation to your personal information?'

  * **Where processing your information is necessary for our legitimate interests** , for example:

Where particular areas of the Gallery are going to be used for filming or photography, we will always flag this in advance with clear signage or otherwise make you aware of the filming in advance, so that you can avoid being filmed or photographed.

See [What this means for our donors, patrons, and potential supporters](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/what-this-means-for-our-donors-patrons-and-potential-supporters "What this means for our donors, patrons, and potential supporters") for more information.

## Sharing CCTV footage and Wi-Fi usage data

  * we normally retain CCTV footage for 30 days although in the event of an accident or incident which may give rise to an insurance claim, which is captured on CCTV, it may be retained longer.



## How do we keep your information secure?

  * Unauthorised access;
  * improper use or disclosure;
