        Cookies and Other Technical Information.</h3>
    <p>
        We may send "cookies" to your computer primarily to enhance your online experience.
        "Cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal
        preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click
        stream data). Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer
        until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).
        We may also use tracking systems such as "Web beacons," which monitor your use of
        our Web sites. Tracking systems (Web beacons or Web bugs) are small strings of code
        that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose
        of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer
        that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource
        Locator) of the page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing
        the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and
        the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that
        server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us
        know whether you received and opened our e-mail.</p>
    <p>
        On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable
        information. However, if you choose to furnish one of our Web sites with personally
        identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the

        Secure Email</h3>
    <p>
        A message for all Nationstar’s clients and business partners: as part of Nationstar’s
        ongoing efforts to strengthen security and to protect sensitive information, we
        have a Secure Email system. It provides a convenient method for you to receive and
        reply to secure emails, while continuing to ensure the integrity of the information
        interchange.
    </p>
    <h4 class="col-accent">
        Will I have to install new software or register for the new system?</h4>
    <p>
        No new software is required on your system. The first time you use the new secure
        email system, you will be asked to create a password. You will also select a password
        recovery question / answer that will allow you to change your password. There are
        no other registration requirements.
    </p>
    <h4 class="col-accent">
        How will I receive secure email messages from Nationstar?</h4>
    <p>
        Secure email messages (and any attached files) from Nationstar will be encrypted
        before they are sent, and then delivered directly to your inbox. When you open the
        message you will be prompted to enter your password, which will decrypt the message
        (and any attached files). You can then save, reply to, or forward the message and
        files.
    </p>
    <h4 class="col-accent">
        Are there reply capabilities? Can I initiate a secure email to an Nationstar Associate?</h4>
    <p>
        You can respond to Nationstar secure emails with secure replies, and there is also
        a method for initiating secure email exchanges with Nationstar associates.
