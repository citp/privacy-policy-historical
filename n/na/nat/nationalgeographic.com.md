**What are cookies and how do we use them?**

Cookies help track a person’s “session” while online. They are used on our site to gather basic tracking information and to monitor the presentation of advertisements. They are especially necessary when playing an interactive game or ordering a product online. Cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information and are not used to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.

In some instances, advertisers will set cookies on our site. These cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information that we have collected but are for monitoring and tracking ad impressions.

Many browsers are set to accept cookies. You may prefer to set your browser to refuse cookies. It is possible, however, that some areas of the site will not function properly if you do so. This is especially likely when trying to order a product or play an online game.

**DoubleClick and Third-Party Advertising**

Advertisements which appear on this Web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, third-party advertisers may place or recognize unique cookies on your browser.
