**What information do we collect from our users and how do we collect it?**

We only contact individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the event that they have won a contest or sweepstakes. Nationalgeographic.com collects personally identifying information from our users during (1) online registration, (2) contest or sweepstakes registration, (3) online surveys, (4) online purchasing, and (5) messages posted to our forum boards. Generally, this information includes name, e-mail address, postal address, and answers to survey questions. This information is used for internal marketing purposes and helps us determine how to continually improve our site. Forum contributors have the option of remaining anonymous.

**What are cookies and how do we use them?**

Cookies help track a person’s “session” while online. They are used on our site to gather basic tracking information and to monitor the presentation of advertisements. They are especially necessary when playing an interactive game or ordering a product online. Cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information and are not used to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.

In some instances, advertisers will set cookies on our site. These cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information that we have collected but are for monitoring and tracking ad impressions.

Many browsers are set to accept cookies. You may prefer to set your browser to refuse cookies. It is possible, however, that some areas of the site will not function properly if you do so. This is especially likely when trying to order a product or play an online game.
