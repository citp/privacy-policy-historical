# Privacy Policy |

The National Athletic Trainers' Association ("NATA") is the sponsor and provider of [www.NATA.org](http://www.nata.org/ "www.NATA.org"). NATA.org provides information and resources designed to enhance the quality of health care for athletes and those engaged in physical activity, and to advance the profession of athletic training through education and research in the prevention, evaluation, management and rehabilitation of injuries.  


This privacy policy only applies to the information collected on the Web site located at [www.NATA.org](http://www.nata.org/ "www.NATA.org").

## Privacy statement

NATA takes your privacy seriously. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy policy discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.

  1. **What personally identifiable information does NATA collect?**

NATA’s primary goal in collecting personal information is to advance NATA’s mission and to maximize your online experience when using our site.

NATA collects personally identifiable information when you provide it to us by logging in to the site as a member. Once you log in to the site, you are no longer anonymous to us.

  2. **What anonymous information does NATA collect?**  


Your Internet browser has a feature called “cookies” which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to our site. However, cookies tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit [www.NATA.org](http://www.nata.org/ "www.NATA.org"). In addition, you may elect not to allow cookies to be collected by selecting certain options on your browser.

NATA also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you requested.

We may use tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including:

    * keeping count of return visits to our site
    * accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on site usage
    * determining which features users like best
    * saving your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.
  3. **How does NATA use the information?**

NATA may use your information to process transactions and to alert you to new information, products and services, events and other opportunities. We may from time to time make your contact information available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find of interest. Additionally, we may use tracking information to determine how much interest a page generates overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps us continue to better understand our users and their needs.

  4. **Is my use of the site secure?**

We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving your information. Additionally, we implement commercially reasonable security measures at our physical facilities to protect against loss or misuse of your information.

  5. **What are my options?**

Users who would rather not provide the user data requested by our membership application process or provide the required log in information do not need to join or log in to the site. You can still view some of the content and use some of the services offered by our site without being a member of NATA. We also give users the choice to opt not to provide certain personal information when joining.

  6. **How will I know if the privacy policy is changed?**

Any modifications to our privacy policy will be reflected first in this notice of our privacy policy. If there is a material change in our privacy practices, we will indicate on our site that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the revised privacy policy. If we intend to use information collected from users in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will send affected users written notice of the change.

  7. **How can I update my personally identifiable information?**

You can correct or change the information collected when you joined by logging on to the site with your ID and password and following the online directions. Users who are experiencing problems or who have questions about how our services work can contact us by [eContact Form](https://web.archive.org/Contact).

Currently, we do not offer users a means by which to completely delete personal information established at the time of joining.

  8. **Privacy of children**

NATA.org is not directed to children under the age of 13. We operate our site in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and do not permit application by, and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age.
