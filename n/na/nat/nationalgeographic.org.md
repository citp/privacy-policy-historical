# Privacy Policy - National Geographic Society

###### Your Privacy Rights

**Privacy Policy Introduction**

The National Geographic Society, nationalgeographic.org, understands the importance of your privacy, and we take our responsibility to protect it seriously. Our Privacy Policy tells you what information we collect about you when you visit this website or use an online application that contains a link to this Privacy Policy (the “Services”). Our Privacy Policy also tells you how we use, share and protect this information; what choices you have about how this information is used; and how you can access and update this information. Certain aspects of this Privacy Policy also apply to the personally identifiable information we collect offline.

Under our Privacy Policy, “personally identifiable information” means information that identifies and can be used to contact a particular individual, such as name, postal address, email address, and phone number.  When other information, such as email newsletter choices, magazine or product purchases, or consumer product preferences, is associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information. 

**The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) using our Services please note:

  * The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new comprehensive data protection law that updates existing EU laws to strengthen the protection of “personal data” (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, so called “data subjects”) in light of rapid technological developments, the increasingly global nature of business and more complex international flows of personal data. The GDPR replaces the current patchwork of national data protection laws with a single set of rules, directly enforceable in each EU member state. The GDPR takes effect on May 25, 2018. In addition to this Privacy Policy, if you would like to know more about how we, and our partner organization National Geographic Partners, LLC, are implementing  the GDPR please visit our Frequently Asked Questions  <http://help.nationalgeographic.com/customer/en/portal/topics/1113429-gdpr-faqs/articles>.
  * We may need to collect and process certain personal information as described in this Policy in order to provide the Services to you, or because we are legally required to do so. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide the Services to you.  We may use this information only for legitimate business reasons described in this Policy. 
  * We do not knowingly permit children in the EEA under age 16 to register for any content, product or Service. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information about users under age 16, except as permitted by law. 
  * We keep your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include (i) for as long as we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you; (ii) as required by a legal obligation to which we are subject; or (iii) as advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard of applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).
  * If you would like to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for transmittal to another company, request modification or deletion of your Personal Information, or have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you may contact us at [dataprivacy@ngs.org](mailto:dataprivacy@ngs.org) :
