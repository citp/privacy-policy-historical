# Privacy Policy - Natural Holistic Health Learning Center

## This is what we collect about you when you come to our site

Since we actually care about your privacy and to avoid any sensitive information being gathered (to keep you anonymous) we only gather data so we can look at it in order to increase our website traffic. This means when you visit our site: www.natural-holistic-health.com, we collect your IP address, the time of your visit and if you sign up for our free natural health newsletter, your email address.

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Media

If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

## Do we collect anything else?

We also have analytical tools installed, this helps us monitor the keyword you are typing in to reach our site, your preferred browser, the search engine you used to get here and other geeky stuff that won’t really affect your privacy.

## Where is your data stored?

The only data we store is your name and email address if/when you sign up for our newsletter. This information is ONLY used to send you our natural health newsletter.

## How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

## How do we use your information?

We only use this information for internal marketing needs. We do not sell, exchange or release any of the data we gathered. We will not share your information without your consent.

We promise we will not sell your valuable data to other people.

## Where we send your data

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

## What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
