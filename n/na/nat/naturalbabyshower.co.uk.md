We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998).  
We store information about you for two reasons: firstly, to process your order and secondly to provide you with the best possible service. We do not hold credit card information about you. This is only received by Protec who provide the strongest commercially available level of encryption which ensures that your transactions are secure and your credit card details cannot be hijacked or redirected to anyone other than Protec. Look for the yellow padlock in the bottom-right of your browser as you enter the Credit Card section of our site. If you do not wish to receive any emails from us in the future please let us know by emailing us on [info@naturalbabyshower.co.uk](mailto:info@naturalbabyshower.co.uk "info@naturalbabyshower.co.uk")

The type of information we will collect about you includes:

  * your name
  * address
  * telephone number
  * email address
  * credit/debit card details



The personal information that we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law.  
The information you provide will only be shared with a third party for the following reasons:

  * Processing your credit card payment (SagePay) 
  * Undertaking checks with credit reference agencies 
  * Assisting fraud prevention and detection agencies 



In these instances, we provide them with only the information they need to perform their function.   
We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time. Whilst we may notify you of such changes it is your responsibility to check the policy each time you use the site. Please note that information passed to a third party in accordance with this policy will be beyond our control. Any query relating to use of your information by a third party should be made directly to that party.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small text files that web sites can send to your computer. A cookie can be thought of as an internet user's identification card, which tells a web site when the user has returned. Cookies are not computer programs, and can't read other information saved on your hard drive. They cannot be used to disseminate viruses, or get a user's e-mail address etc. They only contain and transfer to the web site as much information as the users themselves have disclosed to that web site.  
Cookies make the interaction between users and web sites faster and easier. Without cookies, it would be very difficult for a web site to allow a visitor to fill up a shopping basket or to remember the user's preferences or registration details for a future visit.
