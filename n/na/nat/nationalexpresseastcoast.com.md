### Use of “cookies” and internet tags

We may collect and process anonymous information about your visit to this website, such as some of the pages you visit and some of the searches you perform. Such anonymous information is used by us for purposes which may include, for example, to help improve the contents of the site and to compile, for internal market research purposes, aggregate statistics about individuals using it. In doing this we may install “cookies” that collect the email address of the user and the date and time of access.

A cookie is a file that is stored on your computer’s hard drive or browser that means that our website can recognise that you have visited our website before. They make it easier for you to maintain your preferences on the website, and by seeing how you use the website, we can tailor the website around your preferences and measure usability of the website. Cookies do not damage your computer and you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, which in turn will enable you to decide whether or not you want to accept it or not. You can, should you choose, disable the cookies from your browser and delete all cookies currently stored on your computer. For further information about cookies, please visit [**www.allaboutcookies.org**](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

We may also use Internet tags in combination with cookies at this site and may deploy these tags through a third-party advertising partner. These tags are placed on both on-line advertisements that bring users to the site and on different pages of the site. We use this technology to measure visitor response to our sites and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns (for example, look at how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted). The third-party partner may be able to collect anonymous aggregated data about visitors to other sites because of these Internet tags and cookies.
