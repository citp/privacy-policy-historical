                      identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive 
                      through your web browser. Information we collect and analyze

                  Iron Traffic Inc. periodically sends e-mail offers to its web

                  first e-mail you receive and click on the opt-out link provided, 
                  which will remove your e-mail address from our database. You 
                  will then receive no further e-mail communications from us. 
                  If you do not scroll down to the bottom of the first e-mail
