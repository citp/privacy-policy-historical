		      This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for the websites of Brown Shoe Company, Inc., which include but are not limited to the websites of Naturalizer, LifeStride, Franco Sarto, Dr. Scholl’s, Via Spiga, Carlos by Carlos Santana, and Shoes.com. This policy has been updated as of 4/14/2008.<br>
                <br>
			    Brown Shoe Company, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  This information will not be shared with, sold or rented to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.<br>
                <br>
			    This privacy statement will notify you of:<p></p>
                <ul>
			    <li>The information collected from you through the website</li>
				<li>How the information is used</li>
			    <li>With whom the information may be shared</li>
                <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information</li>
                </ul>
<p>
</p><h3><u>Information Collection and Use</u></h3>

			    Information is collected from users at several different points on this website, including registration and order forms.  We may use this information in the following ways:<br>
<br>
			    When you provide your information to one of Brown Shoe Company, Inc.’s websites, we may share that information with one or more of our other websites.<br>
<br>
			    In order to streamline your shopping experience, we recommend that you complete our registration form. During registration you are required to give personal contact information (such as name and email address). By registering your account information, you are able to take advantage of special offers and e-mails about new promotions, fashion trends, site and service announcement updates, etc. It is also more convenient for a registered customer to make purchases online. We do not share your registration information with outside parties.<br>
<br>
			    On the order form, you must provide contact information (such as name, billing address and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill customer orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this contact information to get in touch with you.<br>
<br>
			    If you elect to refer a friend to our website, we ask you for your name and email address and your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend an email inviting him or her to view your selected items on the website.  We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this email.<br>
<br>
			    The personal information you provide may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from Brown Shoe Company, Inc., records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. <br>
<br>
			    From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. We may share this information with our service providers who perform services such as gathering survey data or facilitating contests on our behalf, but we do not authorize these providers to disclose or use your information for any other purpose. <br>
<br>
			    Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive information on products, services and special promotions. Please see our Choice and Opt-out statement below.<p></p>
                
<p></p><h3>Choice and Opt-out</h3>
			    Our users are given the opportunity to “opt-out” of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our Customer Account information form has an opt-out mechanism so users who register with us but don’t want any marketing material can keep their email address off our lists. If you no longer wish to receive our promotional materials, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the unsubscribe option at the bottom of any email communication you receive or by clicking <span class="mainTxtLinks"><a href="/suggestionbox.asp">here</a></span>.<p></p>
<p></p><h3>Cookies</h3>
		      A cookie is a short string of data that lets our website remember who you are, serving much like a unique membership ID.  We use cookies to remember reference keys to some of your search preferences, express checkout capabilities and other site preferences so we can provide a more convenient experience during your next site visit.<br>
<br>
   			  We don't store any personal information in the cookie--it's really just a combination of numbers and letters that uniquely identify your computer.  We absolutely don't store any credit card or financial data in the cookie.  All real account information and transaction histories are kept in our secure database.  When you leave our site, we terminate our interaction with the cookie.  The cookie stays on your computer, and you can delete it anytime you'd like, but that means that you'd need to login again and re-enter any preferences you have set.<p></p>

<p></p><h3>Log Files</h3>
                We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.<p></p>
                
<p></p><h3><u>Information Shared with Third Parties</u></h3>
<h3>Shipping, Billing and Other Service Companies</h3>
                We use outside shipping companies to ship orders and mail catalogs and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. We may partner with other parties from time to time to provide specific services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<p></p>
                
<p></p><h3>Advertising</h3>
                We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this website. These providers may collect anonymous information about your visits to our site and your interaction with our products. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process.<p></p>
<p></p><h3>Links</h3>
                From time to time, this site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site.<p></p>
<p></p><h3>Legal Process</h3>
                We reserve the right to disclose information about you when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property and interests of Brown Shoe Company, Inc.<p></p>

<p></p><h3><u>Correcting or Updating Personal Information</u></h3>
                If your personally identifiable information (such as your zip code) changes, or if you no longer desire our service, we will provide a way for you to correct, update or remove your personal data provided to us. This can be done via email by clicking <span class="mainTxtLinks"><a href="/suggestionbox.asp">here</a></span>.<p></p>

<p></p><h3><u>Notification of Changes</u></h3><br>
Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on our website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Additionally, if at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email. At that time, you will have a choice as to whether we use your information in this different manner. <br>
      If you feel that we are not abiding by our posted privacy policy, you should first contact:<br>
    <br>
      Naturalizer Customer Service <br>
      8300 Maryland Ave. <br>
      St. Louis, MO 63105<br>

<p></p><h3>Security Policy: Our Commitment to Secure  Connections</h3>
This security  statement discloses the security practices for the websites of Brown Shoe  Company, Inc., which include but are not limited to the websites of  Naturalizer, LifeStride, Franco Sarto, Dr. Scholl’s, Via Spiga, Carlos by  Carlos Santana, and Shoes.com. This statement has been updated as of 4/14/2008.<br>
<br>

This security  statement will notify you of the kind of security procedures that are in place  to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control.<br><br>

This website  takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit  sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both  online and offline. <br><br>

When you are asked to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. While on a secure page, such as our order and registration forms, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and  Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open,  when you are just “surfing.” <p></p>

<dl>
<dd>A Bit About SSL:</dd>
<br>

<dd>Secure connections (often called SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer  technology) are the industry standard in Web security. SSL is used primarily  for transmitting sensitive information over the Internet. When you have a  secure connection between your browser and a website, no one else can easily  access the data that you send across the connection.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
While we use SSL  encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in  our power to protect user information offline. All of our users’ information,  not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our  offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for  example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted  access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are  kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Our employees are  regularly notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and  what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. <br>
<br>
Finally, the  servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a  secure environment.<br>
<br>
If  you have questions about the security at our website, please <span class="mainTxtLinks"><a href="/suggestionbox.asp">contact us via  email.</a></span><br></p>
