# Our privacy policy - KPMG Nunwood

### KPMG Nunwood is committed to protecting the privacy of all information we collect from our clients and from research participants.

##### This policy applies to all client and personal information that we collect or use in the course of conducting our business.

This policy covers all client information and research participant data housed at any KPMG Nunwood facility or stored on the KPMG Nunwood network. Anyone at KPMG Nunwood who has access to such information or data must follow this policy.

The information you give us will be treated with the strictest confidence and in accordance with the Market Research Society Code of Conduct. It will not be passed on to any other person or persons and any personal details you provide will not be used in any sales or marketing activity & no personally identifiable information will be passed onto any third parties unless your consent is given.

#### Client Information

We treat all information we receive from clients as confidential and do not use the information for any purpose other than to fulfil our obligations to clients. We keep client information secure at all times, and prevent the use and disclosure of it by our employees or any third parties.

#### Research Participant Information

All responses to our research are completely confidential. We collect data in our studies for research purposes only, and our use of that information will be limited to that purpose. Research participant answers will not be used by any entity as an aid for sales.

Calls made for the purpose of research are exempt from TPS (Telephone Preference Service) which only applies to sales and marketing calls. Therefore we are entitled to call ex-directory numbers, however, we will not release your personal information to any third party without your consent.

Research participation is voluntary and sample members always have the opportunity to decline involvement or to ‘opt out’ of the research after agreeing to participate. We do not collect personal information without research participant consent.

We do not rent, sell or give personal information to any third party for the purpose of directly marketing any products or services. In some cases we may need to share personal information with third parties that provide research services in support of the research project. Any third party that receives personal information is obligated to follow all of the same privacy protection regulations as followed by KPMG Nunwood.

At their request, we give research participants access to the personal information we have collected about them. We correct any information that is inaccurate or incomplete, change their consent status, or have their personal information deleted.

#### Children

We do not contact children under the age of 18 without consent from a parent or guardian.

#### Information Security

We maintain all necessary physical, electronic and procedural security measures to help safeguard client data and personal information. Third parties that provide us with support or services may also receive client data or personal information, and we require them to maintain security measures similar to ours with respect to such information.

#### Data Integrity

KPMG Nunwood will take reasonable steps to ensure the personal data is accurate, complete, current and relevant, being used only for the intended purposes.

#### Legal Obligations

Under certain circumstances permitted or required by law (for example, in connection with law enforcement investigations), we may be required to disclose client data or personal information without giving notice.

#### Compliance

The information you give us will be treated with the strictest confidence and in accordance with the Market Research Society Code of Conduct. It will not be passed on to any other person or persons and any personal details you provide will not be used in any sales or marketing activity & no personally identifiable information will be passed onto any third parties unless your consent is given.

#### Changes in the Privacy Statement

We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time by posting an amended version of the statement on the KPMG Nunwood website. Please refer to this policy regularly. If at any time we decide to use personally identifiable information in a different manner then was stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you directly via email for your consent.
