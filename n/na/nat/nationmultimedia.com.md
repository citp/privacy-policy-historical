**IP ADDRESSES:** An IP address is a number assigned to the computer which is requesting a web page from our site.

We also use cookies to deliver more targeted advertising, such as ads based on your zip code. For more information on cookies, please see the section on third party web sites below. 

**SURVEYS:** Our online surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis only. We may ask for contact information if we are providing an incentive to users for completing our surveys. The contact information is kept private and only used to contact you if necessary. It is kept separate from any demographic information you provide.
