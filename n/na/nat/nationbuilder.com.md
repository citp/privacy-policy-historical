This Privacy Policy applies to the data collected by us, or those working on our behalf, through information you enter or from the imported data from authorized and approved sources. It does not apply to data collected through other sites, products, or services not approved by us.

By using or accessing our Website or the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies described in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we may collect, use, and share your information as described herein. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Website or our Services. We collect your personal information in order to deliver our Website and Services to you more efficiently. If you do not provide us with the necessary personal information, we will not be able to deliver all the features of our Services and/or Website to you as intended. Remember that your use of our Services is at all times subject to our Master Terms of Service (available at [Master Terms of Service](https://nationbuilder.com/tos "TOS") (the “ **Master Terms** ”)), which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any capitalized terms we use in this Privacy Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Master Terms.

If you are a resident of or subject to data privacy laws or regulations of a country outside of the United States, please see the additional Privacy Policy terms at the end of this document.

## What does this Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect:

  * In email, text and other electronic messages between you and us.
  * When and where available, through mobile and desktop applications, which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and us.
  * When you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to this Privacy Policy.



This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by:

  * Us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by us or any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries); or
  * Any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries), including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on our website.



This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information. This is information which may be connected to you specifically as the individual to whom the information relates. Such information may include name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, or any other information defined as personally identifiable information (or similar term) by applicable laws (“ **Personal Information** ”). Personal Information does not include your personally identifiable information that has been deidentified, pseudonymized, anonymized, aggregated and/or otherwise processed so as to be unidentifiable (i) in such a way that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual, or (ii) in such a way that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual (by reasonable means) without the use of additional information, and where such additional information is kept separate and under adequate security to prevent unauthorized re-identification of a specific individual such that one could not, using reasonable efforts, link such information back to a specific individual (the foregoing being referred to as “ **De-Identified Personal Information** ”).

We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including:

  * to personalize and improve our services;
  * to allow you to set up a user account and profile;
  * to contact you and allow other users to contact you;
  * to fulfill your requests for certain products and services;
  * to provide and improve the Services; and
  * to analyze how you use the Services.



In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.

Please note that some of our Services (e.g., NationBuilder) may allow you to provide us with Personal Information regarding your own users, visitors, supporters or voters (“ **Third Party Personal Information** ”). This Privacy Policy deals with our use of your own Personal Information, and not Third Party Personal Information that you may provide to us in connection with the Services.

We are not responsible for the practices of sites linked to from the Services, or for the privacy practices of nations that are run by our other customers on the Services, and you are advised to review their rules and policies before interacting with any of these sites or nations and before providing them with any private information.

If you are under 18, please do not send any Personal Information about yourself (such as your name, address, telephone number, or email address) to us. No one under age 18 is allowed to provide any Personal Information to or on the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 18 without verification of parental consent, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information from our database. Please contact us at [privacy@nationbuilder.com](mailto:privacy@nationbuilder.com) if you have any concerns.

These cookies do not collect any information which could be used to identify you. All the information collected is aggregated, and therefore anonymous.
  
_Functionality Cookies_
      * These cookies enable our Website to remember the choices you have made when browsing. For example, we can store your geographical location in a cookie so that the Website corresponding to your area is shown.

In order to register as a user with us, you may have the option to sign in using your Facebook or other social media site ("SMS") login.

For example, when you visit our Website or platform, the plugin creates a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server. This allows Facebook to receive information about your visit to our Website or platform with your IP address. If you click the Facebook “Like” button while you are logged on to your Facebook account, you can link the contents of our Website or platform to your Facebook profile. This allows Facebook to assign your visit to our Website or platform to your user account.

We will keep your personal information as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which we obtained it, unless you ask us to delete it at an earlier time. Our retention periods are based on business needs and legal requirements, and your information that is no longer needed is either irreversibly anonymised or destroyed securely.

If you ask us to delete your personal information at an earlier time, we will delete all information we hold on you within 30 days, save for information which is reasonable for us to retain in order to operate our Website or information we are required to retain by law.

Following termination or deactivation of your account, we may retain your profile information and all information posted to public areas of the Service.

If you are a resident of the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (“ **GDPR** ”) will come into force on May 25, 2018.

If you are a resident of country other than the United States, you acknowledge and consent to our collecting, transmitting, and storing your Personal Information out of the country in which you reside.

**Transfer of data outside of the EEA**

We may transfer some or all of your personal information outside of the EEA. The privacy laws of the receiving country may be different from those in the EEA and may not have adequate data protection standards. We will always have appropriate safeguards in place when transferring your personal information outside of the EEA, and you may ask us for a copy of these safeguards.

**Your Rights**

You have the following rights regarding your information:

  * **The right to be informed:** You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your information and your rights. This is why we’re providing you with the information in this Privacy Policy.
  * **The right of access:** You have the right to obtain access to your information (if we’re processing it), and other certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Policy). This is so you’re aware and can check that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection law.
  * **The right to rectification:** You’re entitled to have your information corrected if it’s inaccurate or incomplete.
  * **The right to erasure:** This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there’s no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.
  * **The right to restrict processing:** You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future.
  * **The right to data portability:** You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. Eg, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability.
  * **The right to object:** You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct marketing (which we do only with your consent). For more information or to object, see Objecting to processing.
