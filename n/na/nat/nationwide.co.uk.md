**Definitions**

**Browser or Web Browser**

There are many web browsers but the most common ones are Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Web browsers are used to locate and display web pages.

**IP (Internet Protocol)**

All networks connected to the internet speak IP, the technical standard which allows data to be transmitted between two devices. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is responsible for making sure messages get from one computer to another and that the messages are understood.

**IP Address**

When you are connected to the Internet you have an IP address. It may look something like this - 198.184.98.9.

If you are a dial-up customer using an analogue modem or ISDN, your IP address will usually change each time you connect to the Internet. This means that you cannot be uniquely identified by your IP address.

**Web Server**

The computer which sends web pages to your computer.
