###  Cookies and Other Technical Information.

We may send "cookies" to your computer primarily to enhance your online experience. "Cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). We may also use tracking systems such as "Web beacons," which monitor your use of our Web sites. Tracking systems (Web beacons or Web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.

On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish one of our Web sites with personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/Web beacons.

Your ongoing use of our Web sites constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy, and you specifically agree to our described use of cookies and Web beacons. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other site. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display HTML e-mails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some Web beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of our Web sites can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content. 

###  Secure Email

A message for all Nationstar’s clients and business partners: as part of Nationstar’s ongoing efforts to strengthen security and to protect sensitive information, we have a Secure Email system. It provides a convenient method for you to receive and reply to secure emails, while continuing to ensure the integrity of the information interchange. 

####  Will I have to install new software or register for the new system?

No new software is required on your system. The first time you use the new secure email system, you will be asked to create a password. You will also select a password recovery question / answer that will allow you to change your password. There are no other registration requirements. 

####  How will I receive secure email messages from Nationstar?

Secure email messages (and any attached files) from Nationstar will be encrypted before they are sent, and then delivered directly to your inbox.
