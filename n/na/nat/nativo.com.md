  * **_Internet log files_** We may maintain log files which contain IP addresses (the numeric address that may be assigned to your computer by your ISP) to monitor website traffic, to troubleshoot technical problems, and to report aggregate information to third party advertisers. For website security purposes. To ensure that this Site remains available to all users, we also monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

The information collected includes data about your hardware system (IP addresses, browser type, browser language, platform type), mobile device (if applicable), media, Internet and website usage (domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, the viewing order and the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time).



**How We Use Information**  
We use your name, email address and other personal information we have collected to allow you to access and use this Site and the Services, to fulfill your specific requests, to process your transactions, to administer your inquiries, to provide service notifications, and to solicit your feedback and input. If you choose this feature, we may also use your personal information to send messages about new services, features, enhancements, offers, opportunities and other items of interest.

We use personal and non-personal information, in individual or aggregated form, to analyze the behavior and preferences of our online visitors, to troubleshoot technical problems, to enforce our Terms of Use Agreement, to ensure proper functioning of the Site and to improve the Services. We also combine non-personal information with personal information, to tailor our Services to your preferences or interests and for other related purposes.

**Sharing Information**  
We will not share or disclose your personal information to any third parties without your consent. However, we may disclose information about you to third party contractors in order to provide the Services, to resolve service problems, to correct errors in the Services, to communicate with you, to provide you with information in connection with the Services, and to enhance your experience on this Site. Third party contractors may also use your personal information to provide email delivery, credit card processing, or other Services on this Site. When requesting the Services, you may be asked to provide your personal information, including your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address. When the third party contractors have access to the personal information that you provide to us, we require them to adhere to our privacy policies and to protect the confidentiality of your personal information while performing their duties for us. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose without your specific consent.

**Links to Other Websites**  
This Site may contain hyperlinks to other websites as part of advertising for other products and/or services that appear on this Site. None of these website links is meant as an endorsement, authorization or representation by us of another website or its products and/or services. These providers may require you to disclose personal information in order to register for and access such products and/or services. If you click on a link to another website, including on an advertising hyperlink, you will be leaving this Site. Because we do control these websites, their privacy policies, or activities of any third parties, we are not responsible for any use of your personal information by other parties. Before providing any personal information, be sure to review the privacy policies of the product or service providers from whom you request services or products, including any third party websites linked to this Site.

**Legal compliance**  
You understand and agree that we may disclose personal information we may have about you to law enforcement or the appropriate civil authorities if required to do so by law, to comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order issued by a governmental entity or other competent authority. We may also do so if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to prevent potential or actual injury, loss or damage, to protect our rights, property or operations, or that of our affiliates or the public. The Company is not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that we receive.

**Transfer of Information**  
You agree that we have the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership, the business, and a substantial part of the assets of the Company, whether by acquisition or merger with another company. In such an event, we will notify you when your personal information is transferred and if it becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

**Updating Your Information**  
You can correct or update your user account information or terminate your user account at any time by contacting us. We reserve the right to retain your information in our files following your termination to resolve disputes, enforce our Terms of Use Agreement, for technical purposes, to comply with legal requirements, and for the security, integrity and operation aspects of this Site and the Services.

**Information Security**  
The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and in storage. When you send sensitive information (such as a credit card number) we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of data transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Changes to Privacy Policy**  
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy in any way and at any time. We will attempt to give you advance notice of any change in this Privacy Policy by posting on this Site, or by sending a message informing you of the modified terms with a link to the posting on this Site. However, we reserve the right to make changes immediately, as determined in our sole discretion. You agree to periodically check this Site and to read any changes to this Privacy Policy. Accessing this Site or using the Services after any changes to this Privacy Policy become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy or any future changes to this Privacy Policy, you do not have permission to use the Services and you must immediately discontinue any further use of this Site.
