# Privacy Policy | Natera

We understand the privacy of your personal information is important, and we respect your privacy concerns. The purpose of this policy to let you know what information we collect through the websites we control and operate, including without limitation [http://www.natera.com](http://www.natera.com/), <http://www.natera.com/panorama-test>, <http://www.natera.com/horizon-carrier-screen>, and [http://www.evercord.com](http://www.evercord.com/), and how we handle such information.

This policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used in this policy, terms such as “we” or “our” and “Natera” refer to Natera, Inc. and its current and future affiliated entities, and the Evercord service offered by Natera.

All of our websites are hosted on computer servers in the United States, and governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States and this policy. If you are accessing our websites from a location outside the United States, your interactions with our websites may be deemed as transferring personal information to the United States under your local data protection law. By visiting our websites, you understand and consent to such personal information transfer and to the collection and processing of your personal information by our websites in the United States, a jurisdiction that may not offer the same level of protection to your data as you or your home country.

Natera may change this policy from time to time in order to address new issues and reflect changes. As Natera will post any such changes here, you should visit this policy page regularly.

### Collecting and Using Personal Information

When you pay a bill using our websites, you may be asked to enter your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number and/or credit card information. We will use the information collected from you to process your online payment made through our websites.

When you request additional information through our website(s), you may be asked to provide your name, e-mail address, expected due date and/or phone number.

If you choose to enroll in our newborn stem cell banking service, you may be asked for certain personal information, including but not limited to your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number, and government-issued identification number as well as certain health-related information such as the expected due date, delivery hospital, and doctor or midwife. We will use the information collected from you to process your enrollment and set up your newborn stem cell banking account, and to provide newborn stem cell banking services to you. If you sign up to receive alerts to track your cord blood collection kit, we will use the email address and/or mobile cell phone number you select/provide when signing up to track your kit to provide you with tracking information about your collection kit. If you sign up for our gift registry, we may use and/or display your full name, state and expected due date to personalize your information on our gift registry site and/or in an email that we may send on your behalf announcing your gift registry.

We may ask you for personal information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you answer a survey, when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by us, and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. When you refer a friend or family member for any of our products or services, we may collect the information you provide about that person such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, and/or phone number.

In addition, we may use your personal information for our general business purposes, such as providing the services you request, responding to your inquiries, providing you with information on our health-related products and services that we think you may find of interest, and to keep you updated on our latest announcements. We may also use personal information for internal purposes to help us develop, deliver and improve our products, services, content, advertising and communications.

From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about your account and the services we are providing to you. Because this information is important to your interaction with us, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.

If you enter into a sweepstakes, contest or similar promotion, we may use the information you provide to administer that program and as otherwise set forth in the sweepstake/contest rules.

### Sharing Personal Information

We will keep your information private. We will never sell your information and will only share your personal information with third parties as outlined in this policy and as otherwise permitted by law.

We may share your personal information if all or part of Natera is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or involved in a similar transaction.

We may share your personal information with our trusted third parties who assist us in operating and maintaining our websites, analyzing data collected from the websites, processing credit card payments made using our websites, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.

We may also release your personal information when we believe release is appropriate and necessary to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.

We may also provide non-personally identifiable visitor information to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

### Cookies and Tracking

To facilitate your use of our websites, our websites may assign your browser a unique identification number stored in a file on your computer (a “Cookie”). Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. This unique identification number will automatically identify your browser to Natera’s computers when you interact on our websites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies, but you can reset your browser to disable all Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being set. However, some features of our websites may not function properly if your Cookies are disabled.

When you visit our websites, we may record your IP address. The amount of information about users made available from their IP addresses varies greatly, for instance depending on how they are connected to the Internet.

We also may collect and store basic statistics regarding your interactions with our websites, and have analytics companies use such statistics to understand the number of visitors to the websites, the geographic regions from where visitors are accessing our websites, the date and times when users access our websites, what search terms are used to find our websites, what webpages are visited prior to visiting our websites, what specific pages on our websites are accessed, what browsers are used to view our websites, and the domain names of the servers or browsers used to access our websites.

These Cookies, IP addresses, and statistics, if collected or stored, would be primarily used by Natera to provide better service to Natera clients, to improve our websites, and to enhance and facilitate your use and navigation of our websites.

### Unsolicited Information

When you visit our websites, you may choose to voluntarily submit unsolicited information to Natera through our websites, by e-mail, or by some other means. The choice of whether to provide such information and, if so, how much information to provide is left entirely up to you. Natera may store this unsolicited information and use it to respond and address your submission, for customer service or quality control purposes, or for other business purposes. The extent to which Natera uses or discloses the unsolicited information depends upon the nature of the information provided and the extent to which Natera’s handling of the information is governed by this privacy policy, our websites’ terms of use, or law.

### Third Party Links

If you are directed to our websites through a link on a third party’s website, this third party’s website may collect information about you when you view or click on its website. Natera has no control over this collection of information. You should contact the content provider directly if you have any questions about its use of the information collected. The website and services may have their own privacy policies, or no policy at all. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party websites or services before providing any of them with your personal information.

### Website and Information Security

Natera takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data by maintaining it on servers with restricted access and other security precautions. As confirmed by the secure website certificate, any information that you provide to or receive from our websites is encrypted, and therefore protected against interception by others, using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) encryption technology.
