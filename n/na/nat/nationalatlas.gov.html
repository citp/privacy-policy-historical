<p>Information, products, and services of The National Atlas of
the United States of America<sup><font size="+1">® </font></sup>
delivered on the World Wide Web are provided by the National Mapping
Division (NMD) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Contributions

and disclaimers apply to all Web sites managed by the NMD.</p>

<h4>How we handle the information we gather when you visit our
Web site -</h4>

<p><b>Web server activity logs</b><br>
As part of the normal operation of our Web server, certain information
is automatically and continuously collected and stored in "access"
and "referrer" log files. The information collected
includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the name of the domain from which you access the Internet
  (e.g., "aol.com" if you are connecting from an America
  Online account, or "howard.edu" if you are connecting
  from Howard University's domain);
  </li><li>the type of Web browser you use to view our site;
  </li><li>the type of transaction you engage in (i.e., database query,
  data download, page or image retrieval);
  </li><li>the date and time you access our site; and
  </li><li>the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked
  directly to our site.
</li></ul>

<p>These data are periodically summarized and analyzed in order
to study site usage over time and to perform other studies to
help us improve the site's organization, performance, and usefulness.</p>

<p><b><br>
Electronic mail</b><br>
When you send us personally-identifying information via E-mail
(i.e., in a message containing a question or comment, or by filling
out a form that E-mails us this information), we use it to respond
to your requests. We may forward your E-mail to other Government
employees or contract personnel who are better able to answer
your questions. We do not retain or distribute lists of E-mail
addresses to any parties outside of the USGS except as necessary
to conduct official U.S. Government business. In any event, we
do not distribute lists of E-mail addresses to non-Government
entities, or for commercial purposes.</p>

<p><b><br>
Online surveys</b><br>
When you voluntarily provide us with personal information as part
of our online survey, we use it to perform various quantitative
and qualitative analyses to improve customer service and satisfaction.
We may forward the information collected to other Government employees
or contract personnel to perform the actual analysis. You are
under no obligation to participate in such surveys. Non-participation
will not inhibit your use of our Web site in any way. If you provided
the information to us in error, you may request its removal at
any time.</p>

<p><br>
<b>Marketing information</b><br>
We may collect information from you, with your permission, that
will allow us to provide customer services, such as promotional
materials and product availability notices. We may forward the
information collected to other Government employees or contract
personnel to provide specific marketing services. We will remove
such information at your request.</p>

<p><br>
<b>Collection and release of gathered information</b><br>
We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personally-identifying
information about you when you visit our Web sites, unless you
choose to provide such information to us. Except for officially
authorized law enforcement investigations, or in the event of
a suspected attempt to deliberately circumvent our system's security
with the intent to gain unauthorized access or to do physical
damage (e.g., an attack by hackers), we do not attempt to identify
individual users or share any information we receive with any
parties outside of the USGS. In the latter case, collected information
associated with a suspected intruder might be shared through the
USGS's Bureau Information Resources Security Administrator with
an incident response service such as the <a href="http://www.cert.org/">CERT</a><sup><font size="+1">® </font></sup><a href="http://www.cert.org/">Coordination
Center</a>.</p>

<p><br>
<b>Retention of collected information<br>
Web server activity logs</b> - Monthly extracts of the log files
are archived and stored offline at our discretion for an indefinite
period of time. Some statistical summaries derived from these
data may be retained online or offline at our discretion for an
indefinite period of time.</p>

<p><b>E-mail</b> - Information collected via E-mail will be retained
at our discretion in a directly readable form for as long as necessary
to complete our response. The E-mail may be retained in an archival
form as required by Federal laws and regulations governing the
retention of historical records of government agencies. For more
information, refer to the National Archives and Records Administration's
<a href="http://www.nara.gov/records/">Records Management Program</a>.</p>

<p><b>Online surveys</b> - Information collected via online surveys
may be maintained at our discretion for an indefinite period of
time.</p>

<p><b>Marketing information</b> - Such information may be maintained
at our discretion for an indefinite period of time.</p>
