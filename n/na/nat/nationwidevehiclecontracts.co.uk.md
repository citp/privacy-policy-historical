Please note that this data privacy notice only applies to Nationwide Vehicle Contracts and we are not responsible for, and have no control over, information that is submitted to or collected by third parties, such as those where our website may provide links and banner advertisements to third party sites. Since we do not control those websites, you are responsible for reviewing and abiding by the privacy policies of these third party sites to ensure they comply with the applicable data protection regulations.   


### How long will the data be stored for?

Where possible, Nationwide Vehicle Contracts will take steps to erase any personal data that is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it is collected or otherwise processed, or if you have withdrawn consent for its processing and retention.

As a general rule, if you enter into or took steps to enter into a contract with Nationwide Vehicle Contracts, we will store the data for period of six years for compliance with our general legal obligations and for the exercise or defence of any legal claims.

Under the GDPR, you have the right to ‘block’ or request the deletion or removal of personal data to prevent further processing. This right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’. Specific circumstances in which you can request the deletion or removal of personal data includes:

  * Where the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it is collected or otherwise processed
  * Where you withdraw consent
  * When you object to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate interest for continuing the processing
  * Where the personal data was unlawfully processed (i.e. otherwise in breach of the GDPR)
  * Where the personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation
  * In case a deletion is not possible due to legal, statutory or contractual retention periods, or if it requires disproportionate efforts or prejudices your legitimate interests, the data will be blocked instead of deleted.



### Sharing of data with other data controllers

Here at Nationwide Vehicle Contracts we take your privacy seriously and the information we hold about you is confidential. We will only disclose it outside Nationwide Vehicle Contracts when:

  * you have given us your consent to do so
  * it is necessary for the performance of an agreement of which you will be made aware
  * in order to obtain professional advice (e.g. legal advice)
  * we or others need to investigate or prevent crime (e.g. to fraud prevention agencies)
  * the law permits or requires it
  * regulatory or governmental body requests or requires it, even without your consent, or
  * there is a duty to the public to reveal the information



In order to administer your contract, we may need to share some of your personal information with other data controllers. This processing is necessary for the purposes of delivering specific services to you. You agree that we can share or use your personal data with any of our appointed agents or suppliers to allow us to provide you services and products you have asked us to provide you under this agreement, such as to facilitate delivery of your vehicle, to collect the vehicle from you or notify you of a vehicle safety recall. Other data controllers which we may share this information with may include:

  * Credit reference agencies (to propose you for vehicle finance)
  * The finance provider (to generate the finance agreement)
  * The supplying dealer group (to order and deliver the vehicle)
  * Other credit brokers (to assist with alternative funding solutions if declined finance)
  * Car or van hire providers (to supply you with a hire vehicle for agreements of up to 90 days)
  * Claims handling and fraud prevention agencies (to investigate or prevent crime)
  * Insurance companies (to administer insurance agreements such as GAP insurance)



### Credit reference agencies

In considering your application, we will search your record at credit reference agencies. They will add to your record details of our search and your application and this will be seen by other organisations that make similar searches. On occasion, we may request a credit check with more than one finance provider.

Information held about you by the credit reference agencies may already be linked to records relating to other people with whom you have a financial association. In connection with your application you may be treated as financially linked with them and assessed with reference to any such associated records. Searches may also be made in respect of directors and partners of firms applying for credit.

If you are a joint applicant or if you have told us of some other financial association with another person, or a director of a firm which is applying for a facility you are declaring that you are entitled to:

  * disclose information about your joint applicant, fellow directors and anyone else referred to by you
  * authorise us to search, link or record information at credit reference agencies about you and anyone else referred to by you



The credit reference agency will use a credit scoring system when assessing your application. They will also add to your record details of your agreement with us, specifically the payments you make under it, any default or failure to keep to its terms and any change of address you fail to tell us about where a repayment is overdue. 

These records will be shared with other organisations and will be used by us and them to help make decisions about credit and credit related services such as insurance for you and members of your household, trace debtors, recover debt and to manage your accounts. We and the credit reference agencies will also use the records for statistical analysis about credit.

You have a legal right to know the details of credit reference and fraud prevention agencies we use and to whom we pass information about you. To obtain this information, please contact our Data Protection Officer on 0345 811 9595.

### Fraud Prevention

If you give us false or inaccurate information and fraud (in any form) is identified, details will be passed to the fraud prevention agencies. We and other organisations may also share, access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when:

  * checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities
  * managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities
  * recovering debt
  * checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance
  * checking details of job applicants and employees



In addition, law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.

### Protecting your privacy

In order to protect the personal data collected from you by Nationwide Vehicle Contracts against accidental or deliberate manipulation, loss, destruction or the access of unauthorised persons, technical and organisational security measures are constantly improved as part of our technological development. In addition, our employees, subcontractors and other support staff are obligated to observe confidentiality and data privacy.

Any access to your data that is stored at our company only takes place through an encrypted connection. By using the most up-to-date firewall systems, we provide the best possible protection for your data. Our website, as well as our internal Customer Management System (CMS) is encrypted using a SSL/TSL (Secure Sockets Layer/ Transport Layer Security) connection. SSL is an industry standard and is used by millions of websites in the protection of their online transactions with their customers.

Wherever possible, we have tried to create a secure and reliable website for our users. However, you recognise that your use of the Internet and our website is entirely at your own risk and we have no responsibility or liability for the security of personal information transmitted via the Internet.

You must not use any false identity in email or other network communications and you must not attempt or participate in the unauthorised entry or viewing of another user’s account or into another system.

You must not use the services and/or network systems or any part thereof for fraudulent activities, or to breach another organisation’s security (cross-network hacking). This is an illegal act and prosecution under criminal law may result. You must not use any computers, computer equipment, network resources or any services provided by us for any illegal purpose, or for accessing, receiving or transmitting any material deemed illegal, indecent, offensive or otherwise unacceptable under UK law.

We will monitor network traffic from time to time for the purposes of backup and problem solving and in order to ensure that you are not misusing any of the services provided to you.

### Breaches

### Subject Access Requests

This information is provided to you free of charge however, we can refuse to respond or charge a ‘reasonable fee’ of £10 inc. VAT when a request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive.

We will provide this information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable form such as a CSV file. This allows you to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way, without hindrance to usability. Where possible, we will provide this information via remote access to a secure self-service system, such as our Customer Account area, which would provide you with direct access to your information.
