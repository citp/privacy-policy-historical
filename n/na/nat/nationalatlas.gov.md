The following statements and disclaimers apply to all Web sites managed by the NMD.

Privacy

#### How we handle the information we gather when you visit our Web site -

**Web server activity logs**  
As part of the normal operation of our Web server, certain information is automatically and continuously collected and stored in "access" and "referrer" log files. The information collected includes:

  * the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (e.g., "aol.com" if you are connecting from an America Online account, or "howard.edu" if you are connecting from Howard University's domain); 
  * the type of Web browser you use to view our site; 
  * the type of transaction you engage in (i.e., database query, data download, page or image retrieval); 
  * the date and time you access our site; and 
  * the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site. 



These data are periodically summarized and analyzed in order to study site usage over time and to perform other studies to help us improve the site's organization, performance, and usefulness.

**  
Electronic mail**  
When you send us personally-identifying information via E-mail (i.e., in a message containing a question or comment, or by filling out a form that E-mails us this information), we use it to respond to your requests. We may forward your E-mail to other Government employees or contract personnel who are better able to answer your questions. We do not retain or distribute lists of E-mail addresses to any parties outside of the USGS except as necessary to conduct official U.S. Government business. In any event, we do not distribute lists of E-mail addresses to non-Government entities, or for commercial purposes.

**  
Online surveys**  
When you voluntarily provide us with personal information as part of our online survey, we use it to perform various quantitative and qualitative analyses to improve customer service and satisfaction. We may forward the information collected to other Government employees or contract personnel to perform the actual analysis. You are under no obligation to participate in such surveys. Non-participation will not inhibit your use of our Web site in any way. If you provided the information to us in error, you may request its removal at any time.

  
**Marketing information**  
We may collect information from you, with your permission, that will allow us to provide customer services, such as promotional materials and product availability notices. We may forward the information collected to other Government employees or contract personnel to provide specific marketing services. We will remove such information at your request.

  
**Collection and release of gathered information**  
We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our Web sites, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Except for officially authorized law enforcement investigations, or in the event of a suspected attempt to deliberately circumvent our system's security with the intent to gain unauthorized access or to do physical damage (e.g., an attack by hackers), we do not attempt to identify individual users or share any information we receive with any parties outside of the USGS. In the latter case, collected information associated with a suspected intruder might be shared through the USGS's Bureau Information Resources Security Administrator with an incident response service such as the [CERT](http://www.cert.org/)® [Coordination Center](http://www.cert.org/).

  
**Retention of collected information  
Web server activity logs** \- Monthly extracts of the log files are archived and stored offline at our discretion for an indefinite period of time. Some statistical summaries derived from these data may be retained online or offline at our discretion for an indefinite period of time.

**E-mail** \- Information collected via E-mail will be retained at our discretion in a directly readable form for as long as necessary to complete our response. The E-mail may be retained in an archival form as required by Federal laws and regulations governing the retention of historical records of government agencies. For more information, refer to the National Archives and Records Administration's [Records Management Program](http://www.nara.gov/records/).

**Online surveys** \- Information collected via online surveys may be maintained at our discretion for an indefinite period of time.

**Marketing information** \- Such information may be maintained at our discretion for an indefinite period of time.
