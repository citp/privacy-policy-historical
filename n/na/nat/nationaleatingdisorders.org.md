# Privacy Policy

* * *

* * *

The National Eating Disorders Association wants you to be aware of how personal information about you may be used when you visit our web site. 

We respect your privacy. We want you to know how much control you have over your personal information when you use our site. 

We also want you to know that your personal information sometimes goes outside your control or our control. 

We hope you will take time to educate yourself about how your personal information is used when you visit here. 

**Giving Your Personal Information**

You give us your personal information in several ways. For example: 

  * If you join the National Eating Disorders Association, you tell us your name, details about where you live and how to contact you, and other personal information. You also give us information about your credit card or checking account. 
  * The same is true if you become a Professional Member of the Association to participate in our referrals program. In addition, Professional Members give us information about their credentials. 
  * If you donate to the National Eating Disorders Association, you send us the same kind of personal information as someone who joins. 
  * If you order learning or teaching materials on this site from the National Eating Disorders Association, you furnish us with your contact and credit card or checking account information. 
  * If you participate in our Ask the Expert Program, you may voluntarily tell us information about you and your personal life. 
  * If you participate in our Information and Referral Program, you may voluntarily tell our helpline staff or volunteers personal information about you. 
  * When you visit this site, our computer system automatically receives information from your computer that may sometimes identify you or transmit information about you. 
  * When you use one of the links on the National Eating Disorders Association site to visit another site that we do not operate, information about you or about your computer may be given automatically to the new site. 
  * If you order learning or teaching materials from one of these other sites, you may furnish the operator of that other site with your contact and credit card or checking account information. 
  * There may be other ways that your use of this site may give us your personal information. For example, you give us your personal information when you use this site to register for one of our meetings or conferences, or when you give us feedback. 



**Our Use of Your Personal Information**

We use reasonable means to protect your personal information. We have internal procedures that regulate how our staff and volunteers may access and use your personal information. We also take reasonable precautions to protect our computer systems from hackers or others who may seek unauthorized access. However, no computer system can be completely secure, so there is some risk that someone could gain unauthorized access, or make unauthorized use, of the personal information on our computer system.

We hire people who are not on our staff, and outside firms, to help us with our web site. Those people and firms are obligated to treat all personal information on our web site in confidence. 

The National Eating Disorders Association offers you the opportunity to participate in various programs on this site. You may also chose to be on a list to receive information from us, or to be contacted by us. For example, you may want to receive newsletters or surveys from us. In each case, you must make the choice to participate. This choice is called "opting in." 

At any time, you may decide to stop participating in an activity. You may also at any time decide you no longer want to be on a particular list, or on all the lists, on this site. If you notify us in writing of this choice by clicking [here](mailto:info@nationaleatingdisorders.org) or by U.S. mail, we will make reasonable efforts to remove you promptly. Usually we can remove you within 10 business days. 

Even if we remove your personal information from all our computer systems, your personal information may still be somewhere on our computer system. For example, it may be on a backup system. It may also be in our old computer or paper records, called "archives." However, your personal information will not be on the parts of the computer system that we use actively, day by day, to run the National Eating Disorders Association. 

The National Eating Disorders Association does not use any "cookies." Cookies are computer codes that some sites use to get back information from the user's computer. A Cookie on the user's computer sends information back to the site about how the users acts or uses the site. The National Eating Disorders Association does not do this. 

We may change our privacy policy from time to time. We suggest that you look at our privacy policy from time to time to keep yourself informed about how we use your personal information. 

**Use of Your Personal Information by Others**

You may use links on our web site to leave the National Eating Disorders Association's site and go to other web sites. The National Eating Disorders Association does not control or monitor any of these other sites. 

By using a link, you will make a computer connection to the new site. Some personal information from your computer will go automatically to the new site when the connection is made. You also may decide to give the new site additional personal information. The National Eating Disorders Association does not know what the new site will do with any of the personal information that you give to the new site. We cannot control what they do. It is important for you to learn about the privacy policy of each new site before you give the site any personal information. 

**Parents and Children**

The National Eating Disorders Association web site is directed to adults and to children 13 and older. We suggest that children under 13 use this site only with the active supervision of a parent or another adult who is responsible for the child. 

**Questions or Complaints**

If you have questions about how we handle your personal information, or complaints, please contact us at 1-206-382-3587 and ask to speak to our Administrative Assistant.
