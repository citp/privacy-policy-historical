###  What information do we share with others?

Native Remedies is a subsidiary of Blyth, Inc. and as such we may share the information we collect with corporate affiliates. 

Service providers: To provide you the best possible service and products, we provide information to outside companies that help us deliver the products and services offered. For example, we may work with an outside company to manage a database of customer information or to distribute our emails.

At times we may partner with outside vendors to provide additional services or products outside those offered by NativeRemedies.com. Should you choose to accept or subscribe to offers from third parties, we may pass your relevant personal information, including name and credit card number, to the third party whose offer you have accepted. Your information will be transferred securely, and as a convenience, you will not need to re-enter your personal information. Your acceptance of a third party offer gives NativeRemedies.com implied permission to share your personal information. Your personal information will not be released without your permission, as evidenced by your acceptance or subscription to an outside third party offer.

Other companies: We do not rent or sell your e-mail address to anyone.

### How do we use Cookies?

A "cookie" is a small file stored on your computer by a web site that gathers certain information about your computer’s activity on the site (but not specifically who is using it). We use cookies to track activity and enable the interaction of our website with visitors for such things as adding items to your shopping cart and allow us to associate the cookie with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database.

Our cookies do not store any personal or financial information about you. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies and allow you to disable the use of cookies. However, if you disable this feature, certain aspects of the Native Remedies web site, such as the shopping basket and "My Account" will not function properly.

### Pixel Tags or Web Beacons

"Pixel tags" or "Web beacons" are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our websites and may be placed inside emails to allow us to track certain activity. Tracked activity includes such things as being able to tell if the email was opened, how many times a recipient opened the email, whether or not they clicked a link and how many links were clicked.
