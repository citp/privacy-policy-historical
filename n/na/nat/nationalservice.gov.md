### Information Security, Privacy and Contractor Security Requirements

The Federal Information Security Act (FISMA), Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), and recent OMB Memorandums instituted a number of security and privacy requirements that must be reflected in all federal contracts. Recent changes to the FAR provided guidance as to how to include information security and privacy requirements in contracts for information technology components and services, information and data management services, and related support. 

Our recent FISMA system security assessments confirmed that all current Corporation information technology contracts as well as contracts where contractors are provided access to CNCS IT systems or facilities require modification to include consideration for FISMA, HSPD-12, and OMB security requirements. To assist current and potential contractors and vendors, CNCS is making its information, privacy, and contractor security requirements available at <http://www.nationalservice.gov/pdf/infosec_contract_clauses.pdf>.
