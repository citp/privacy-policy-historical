**NationJob's Policy on Personal Privacy**

Job searching is a personal process, not a public one. It is our policy at NationJob to do our best to keep it that way. We work to the best of our ability to only collect the minimum amount of information about each user of our service to enable you to get the results you need, and we use every effort to ensure that the information that you do submit remains private.

The data that we collect is used in the aggregate. This allows us to better understand how our service is used, and to let clients and partners know what types of people they can expect to reach through our site. We do not disclose information about individual visits or share other personal information (i.e., e-mail addresses) with outside parties. We do not specifically collect information about children.

NationJob has partnered with a number of other companies in order to provide additional services. Note that information submitted on co-branded pages goes directly to these partner companies and is subject to their privacy policies. NationJob is not responsible for the information that the partner companies receive.

You have the opportunity to share success stories and other comments with NationJob via e-mail (usually through the [successpj@nationjob.com](mailto:successpj@nationjob.com) account). These comments become the property of NationJob, Inc. We may use this information for marketing purposes, or to contact you for further comments.

Changes to our privacy policy will be posted on the site. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at 888-256-1750.
