# About Us :: Legal

  


This Web site is owned and operated by The Nature Conservancy. Our intention is to provide an informative tool for those interested in conservation and as a means of allowing our constituency to become more involved in our mission. We recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about the information they provide to us and how we treat that information. The Nature Conservancy is committed to honoring our constituents' privacy preferences.

To this end, the Conservancy supports the following principles:

Consumer Choice

We believe a visitor to our site is the one to best determine:

  * When—and under what conditions—to provide "personally identifiable information" (e.g. data that may be used to identify, contact, or locate a person). 
  * When such information may be shared with other organizations. 
  * When to remain anonymous. 



Informed Consent

If personally identifiable information is collected, we believe a visitor to our site has the right to:

  * Know when we are collecting personal information. 
  * Know what personal information is collected, and the purpose of collection. 
  * Expect the opportunity to choose whether or not personal information will be provided to any third parties. 
  * Expect reasonable steps to be taken to protect personal information from unauthorized use. 
  * Review the accuracy of personal information and update it. 



PRIVACY POLICY  
Your right to privacy is very important to us. We recognize that providing us with personal information is an act of trust. Therefore, we have created a privacy policy to protect your personal information.

This policy covers Web sites owned or operated by The Nature Conservancy. We encourage you to take the time to read this privacy policy and those of any Web site you visit.

Below is a summary of the Conservancy's online privacy policy.

Personal Information Collected  
In general, when you visit our Web sites and access information you remain anonymous. We do not require you to register or provide personal information to us to view our site. 

There are occasions when we will ask for additional information. We do this to better understand and respond to your needs, and provide you with services that may be valuable to you. For example, personally identifiable information will be collected in order for you to become a member of The Nature Conservancy online. 

Use of Information  
Personally identifiable information is made available to other non-profit organizations and occasionally to for-profit organizations unless you request otherwise. Whether or not you choose to share your information will have no impact on your interaction with us. Members may choose a [confidentiality option](https://web.archive.org/web/20021205100838id_/http://nature.org/aboutus/misc/art5099.html) or call Member Service Center Monday through Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST at (800) 628-6860. We will not provide any of your personal information to other organizations if you elect to keep your record private.

Security of Your Credit Card Information  
We will take appropriate steps to protect your privacy. We will also protect your personal information in storage. For example, if you supply us with your credit card information to become a member or make a donation, we encrypt the card number. Contributions may also be made by printing out the online form and mailing it to

Attn: Member Service Center  
4245 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 100  
Arlington, VA 22203-1606

or calling our Member Service Center between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST at (800) 628-6860.

Links to Third Party Sites  
We provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those Web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party sites.

Cookies

What are "Cookies"?  
"Cookies" are small files sent from a Web server to your computer through your browser program. There are two types of cookies: non-persistent and persistent cookies.

A non-persistent cookie enables a Web site to temporarily keep information on your computer as you travel from one page to another on our site. This cookie is automatically deleted from your machine when you close your browser. Because these cookies are necessary to provide some functions, failure to allow such cookies may make some of the functions on our Web site unavailable to you.

A persistent cookie is kept even when you close your browser. You can manually delete these cookies using commands specific to your browser and computer system. These cookies store information that would generally not change from session to session. They also contain information that would need to be reentered by you each time you visit the Web site. For example, a common use of persistent cookies is to allow a registered site visitor to enter the site without having to specify their user-id and password.

Use of Cookies  
The Nature Conservancy uses cookies for various reasons. The Nature Conservancy only reads cookies written by our site. It does not use cookies to obtain information on other Web sites that you may visit. We may use cookies to store some history about the parts of our sites that you have visited to help you navigate our site more easily or to alert you to related pages on our site that may interest you. 

How to unsubscribe from Nature News newsletters or our Email List  
If at any time you wish to stop receiving our electronic newsletter, _Great Places_ , or to be removed from our email list, you can unsubscribe from that list as explained in each message. We do not share email addresses with other organizations. 

Electronic Mail sent to us containing personal information  
You may decide to send The Nature Conservancy personally identifying information, for example, in a message containing information about your membership. We will only use this information to identify you as a member of The Nature Conservancy and to determine how to respond to the electronic mail. We will not use this information for any purpose other than to resolve the matter identified in the email. 

Questions  
The Nature Conservancy welcomes comments and questions on this policy. We are dedicated to protecting your personal information, and will make every reasonable effort to keep that information secure. 

If you have any questions, please contact us at [comment@tnc.org](mailto:comment@tnc.org) or call our Membership Services Center between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST at (800) 628-6860.

You can help the Conservancy maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any changes to your address, title, phone number or email address. To update your membership file, email us at [comment@tnc.org](mailto:comment@tnc.org), or write us at:

Arlington, VA 22203-1606 

The information you provide to us will also be covered by this policy.  
Due to the rapidly evolving technologies on the Internet, we may occasionally update this policy. All revisions will be posted to this site. A revised Privacy Policy will apply only to data collected subsequent to its effective date.
