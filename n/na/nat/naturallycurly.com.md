# Our Privacy Policy on NaturallyCurly.com

##  Our Commitment to Privacy

We respect the privacy of your information. We provide this explanation about our online information practices as a show of our commitment to protect your privacy.

We do not sell or rent or share personally identifying information collected during your use of our Website without your permission.

##  The Information We Collect

At the time you register on our site or you make a purchase request or agree to participate in a promotion, we collect and store your name, address, credit card numbers and other personally identifying information. We need this information to provide goods and services that you request and, assuming you indicate your desire to receive our newsletter, to let you know of additional goods and services about which you might be interested. We also use this information to customize your experience using our Website.

We may also ask you for personally identifying information at other times, such as if you enter into a promotion, post a classified ad, communicate with us, or complete a survey. If you opt-in to receive information regarding a promotion, you give us your permission to share your name and e-mail address with the third party offering the promotion.

In addition, we automatically gather general statistical information about our Website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services purchased, etc., but in doing so we do not reference you by individual name, e-mail address, home address, or telephone number. We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our site so we can improve our site. We may provide this statistical information to third parties, but when we do so we do not provide personally identifying information without your permission. 

As part of our service, we use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you are and enable us to access your account information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by registered or unregistered users, research visiting patterns, and help target advertisements based on user interests; assist our retail partners track visits and process orders; and track progress and participation in promotions. In some instances, our retail partners and advertisers appearing at our site may use their own cookies. Preference and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can change those configurations on your computer if you desire. By changing your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you do so and cookies are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your information more often and certain features of our site may be unavailable.

##  The Way We Use Information

We use your personally identifying information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site’s content, layout, and services. 

We may use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services and promotions. You can opt out of receiving this information by clicking on the link you received in your confirmation email. We may ask you to provide us voluntarily with additional information regarding your personal or business interests, experience or requests which may use to customize our service for you.

If you sign up for our e-mail newsletter, we use your e-mail address to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and communications relevant to your use of the site. We will not send you promotions or announcements unless you give us permission to do so. 

If you place a request for products or services, we use information to ship your order.

We may also use information to resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may review status or activity of multiple users to do so. We may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and improve our products and services. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to manage our Website and to enhance our site based on the usage pattern data we receive.

##  Security

We employ reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information. 

Your account information and profile are password-protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This is to help ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place where others may have access to it.

Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online – for example on message boards, through e-mail or in chat areas – that information can be collected and used by others. 

No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

##  How You Can Update, Correct or Delete Your Information

You can access the information that we collect online and maintain through normal updating methods. To update, correct or delete this information, you can contact techadmin@naturallycurly.com. Your account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in your not being able to access member services.

##  Children Under 13

We have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our Website, and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages. If a child has provided us with personally identifying information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information and opt out of promotional opportunities. 

## Third Party Practices

The Privacy Policy of an advertiser or promotional service appearing at our site may differ from ours. We encourage you to read that policy before responding to the offer.

##  Changes to Our Policy

Changes to our Privacy Policy may occur without further notice to you. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be communicated through our Website as soon as reasonably possible. Information collected before changes are made will be secured according to the previous Privacy Policy.

##  Your Consent

By using our Website, you consent to the collection and use of this information in the manner we describe. 

## Product Reviews Disclosure

NaturallyCurly.com, Inc. occasionally receives free material from various manufacturers in connection with the manufacturer's desire to have its products reviewed by NaturallyCurly.com and its members. Furthermore, some of these manufacturers are NaturallyCurly.com advertisers.
