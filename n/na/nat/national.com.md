# National Semiconductor Website - Use of "Cookies"

**Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is very important to us. National Semiconductor Corporation ("National") adheres to the following privacy policy regarding its collection, use and dissemination of personal and non-personal information collected through its website ("Site"). National reserves the right to modify its privacy policy at any time.

**Collection of Non-Personal Information**  
Whenever you visit a web page on the internet, your browser automatically identifies the IP address from where your page request was initiated. It also volunteers certain basic information like browser type, the operating system you are running, and in some cases the page from which you referred to the Site. National's server automatically collects this information and tracks it on a page by page and on a statistical basis.

**Use of Non-Personal Information**  
National uses non-personal information such as the region or country of the world from which your IP request emerged to suggest the appropriate language presentation or to select the best promotion aligned to that region of the world. We also use browser type, operating system, and page visits for statistical analysis of site usage and navigation trends.

**Collection of Personal Information**  
When you create your personal preferences and workspace with National we will ask for your name, your e-mail address, and when applicable, your billing address, and the address for shipment of your order. National also uses ["Cookies"](https://web.archive.org/webteam/cookies.html) to collect personal information about our visitors.

**Use and Disclosure of Personal Information**  
We maintain personal information for statistical purposes to improve our Site for users' needs, to offer services, to administer the Site, to correspond with users and for other purposes related to the reason you gave it to us. National will not give or sell this information to third parties other than to assist us in providing information or services to you or to manage and improve the Site and database. For example, National may provide your name and delivery address to third parties that National uses for delivering products to you. National will also respond to legal requests for information where required by law to do so.

**Access to Personal Information Stored On The National Servers**  
You can modify or delete your contact information within the My Profile page at any time through the My Profile page available as a link in the headers of the Site. You can also modify your personal preferences through the [My Notifications](https://web.archive.org/profile/user_info.cgi) link available in the headers of the Site.

**Correspondence and Notifications**  
When you create your Personal Workspace on the Site, you can complete a personal interest profile. Where possible, National uses this interest profile as well as your activity on the Site as collected via Cookies to modify the information delivered to your browser to be more aligned to your interest preferences. National also will use your interest profile and your activity on the Site, to communicate with you over e-mail or to make offers to you during your visits. If you wish us to discontinue sending e-mails to you, we will terminate the activity upon receipt of your request.

**Commerce and Ordering Information**  
If you are using a secure server to buy something, we will also ask for your credit card number and expiration date. This information will be used only for the limited purpose of processing your orders.

**External Links**  
The Site contains links to third party sites. Since National does not control those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites.

**Security**

When you transact business with National our goal is to ensure that your information will be transmitted across the web with the highest degree of security possible. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology which encrypts sensitive information such as your name, address, phone number, credit card etc. The Site also uses the [Verisign digital identification](https://digitalid.verisign.com/server/about/aboutFAQ.htm) service which allows your browser to properly confirm the server you are transacting with is National's server. During the transaction, the server is properly identified with your browser and the information is encrypted before your personal and credit card information is transmitted.

Access to your personal information is limited to National employees and our services providers who we believe have a justified business reason to access your information. All personal information is protected through password access and only to identified corporate users.

**Please note:** Some corporate firewalls do not support secure-SSL transmissions. If you experience problems when trying to connect using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), please contact your internet administrator and confirm if your corporate firewall supports SSL.
