For example, if you enter your email address when you register for an online account with TI, or your postal address when you purchase products or request product information, this data will be used to serve your request (e.g., to confirm, change, bill, track, and deliver your products or to provide you with the product and service information you requested).

In addition, TI collects certain information about you, your browser, operating system, and/or your visit when you use TI’s sites.

We use this information to enhance our site services and to personalize information provided to you.

TI may also use Personal Data and information collected on TI sites to help us deliver relevant marketing messages to you. These messages may be delivered on our sites, by third parties, via email, or via other TI services. We use this information to ensure you see products of interest to you, manage the frequency with which you see an advertisement, tailor advertisements to better match your interests, and to help us understand the effectiveness of our advertising.

TI and, in some circumstances, third parties working on our behalf, analyze Personal Data and information collected on TI sites (and may utilize Google Analytics™ web analytics service, Adobe® Analytics, or similar tools) to assess trends, statistics and customers’ needs, to help us improve and customize our sites and our products and to track the effectiveness (e.g., conversions) of our advertising.

TI may share your Personal Data with its subsidiaries and with third parties worldwide for processing, storage, fulfillment, and other business related purposes.

If you are located outside of the United States, please note that information we collect, including Personal Data, may be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country or jurisdiction in which you are located, and your Personal Data may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States.

## 9\. Mobile Applications

TI makes certain apps available for download from various mobile application platforms. When you download or use TI apps, such apps may use information you provide through the app to deliver the services or functionality you have requested. For example, if you enable wireless connectivity between your mobile device and another device, an app may automatically detect your Service Set Identifier and allow you to enter additional information to enable connectivity. Certain TI apps generate crash reports (which may include your device’s IP address, and language and country of origin) using software developed by third parties to help TI improve and resolve software issues. The download and use of TI apps may be subject to additional terms of use and may include additional privacy notices. You are encouraged to carefully review such additional terms and/or notices. 

You may opt out at any time from allowing an app’s access to and use of Personal Data and other data by refraining from using application features that use or collect specific types of information. You also may opt out by uninstalling an app from your device. Once you have uninstalled an app, information it may have stored is typically deleted, including any preferences you previously set around location permissions. 

Use of third party services within an app, such as social media platforms (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) or file-sharing services (e.g., Dropbox), are governed by the terms of use and privacy practices of such platforms and services.

## 10\. Social Computing Environment and Public Areas

TI provides social computing tools on some of its sites to enable online sharing and collaboration among members who have registered to use them. These include forums (e.g., TI E2E Community, deyisupport community), TI wikis, blogs, and other social media platforms. When registering to use certain social computing tools on TI’s sites, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Data. Registration information on TI sites will be subject to this Privacy Policy, except for information (including Personal Data) that is automatically made available to the public (for example, as part of your profile), or that you make available, to other participants. These tools may also include supplemental terms of use and may include additional privacy notices.

Any other content or information (such as pictures, opinions, or Personal Data) you post or make available to other participants on third party social media platforms is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Rather, such content is subject to the terms of use and privacy practices of those platforms, and any additional guidelines and privacy information provided in relation to their use, as well as the process by which you can remove your content from such tools. You should be aware that the content you post on any social computing platforms or sites—which may include your name and location— becomes public and you should exercise caution in deciding to disclose it.

## 11\. Data Security

TI cares about the security of your Personal Data, and we take certain steps intended to protect it. TI uses a variety of commercially available security technologies to protect your Personal Data. However, transmissions over the Internet are never entirely secure or error-free, and it is your responsibility to safeguard any password, user ID and other Personal Data while using our sites.

## 12\. Children under the Age of 13

The majority of TI sites are not directed at, and are not intended for, children under the age of 13. TI sites that are not directed at children under the age of 13 will not knowingly collect data from them. A few portions of TI’s Education Technology Group sites may include material directed at children under the age of 13 as part of a broader family audience target. When the collection of Personal Data is involved, those specific web pages will be clearly identified, and will require that a parent’s or guardian’s permission is secured when required by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Appropriate notices and instructions will be included on such sites. Parents wishing to access, review or delete their child’s Personal Data should contact us through our [Feedback Form](http://www.ti.com/general/docs/feedbackform.jsp).
