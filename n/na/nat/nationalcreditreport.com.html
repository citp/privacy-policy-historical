		<h3>Privacy</h3>
		<p><span class="heading2">The opportunities you deserve, the 
			privacy you expect</span><br>
			The purpose of this document is to explain how Nationalcreditreport.com
			uses your personal information when and after you obtain products 
			or services from us. We want you to know that information given 
			to us is safe, secure and used in a responsible manner.</p>
		<p>Nationalcreditreport.com does not share credit report information
			except as permitted by law. Credit report information includes 
			all information appearing on your credit report which bears on 
			your creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, personal 
			characteristics, or mode of living and that is expected to be 
			used as a factor in establishing your eligibility for credit or 
			insurance (such as your credit score or information about your 
			outstanding debts and payment history).</p>
		<p>To offer you all the greatest advantages as a Nationalcreditreport.com
			customer, we find that sharing limited amounts of your personal 
			information, other than credit report information, within our 
			Nationalcreditreport.com family of companies and with well-respected,
			carefully selected business partners enables us to offer you personalized 
			products and services at lower costs and/or much greater convenience 
			than otherwise would be possible.</p>
		<p><span class="heading2">Your protection is our priority</span><br>
			We use advanced data-encryption and storage technology to protect 
			your sensitive personal information. Also, we are proud members 
			of recognized online privacy and security organizations such as 
			VeriSign™, Inc.</p>
		<p>We have implemented extensive administrative, technical and physical 
			safeguards and quality controls. These include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Setting policies and procedures for carefully handling your 
			information</li>
			<li>Limiting physical access to central facilities through the 
			use of guard personnel and state-of-the-art security systems</li>
			<li> Requiring third-party business partners to agree contractually 
			to comply with privacy laws to do business with Nationalcreditreport.com</li>
			<li> Auditing company security practices</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Clearly stated policies in our employee handbook, background 
			checks on all employees and thorough on-the-job training in confidentiality 
			and customer privacy ensure that our employees are committed to 
			keeping your personal information safe and secure.</p>
		<p><span class="heading2">You are protected on the Internet</span><br>
			Unlike many other companies, Nationalcreditreport.com has designed
			many features of our website to let you anonymously explore various 
			product and service options and other helpful functions, without 
			revealing your identity. The only information we collect is from 
			"cookies" or similar devices, which provide limited 
			data, such as the date, time and areas of our website that were 
			visited. This general information enables us to serve you better 
			by continually improving our website and making it more convenient. 
			Only when you're ready to order one of our products or services 
			do we ask for identifying information, so that we can quickly 
			process your request.</p>
		<p>When you are asked to enter this personal information on our 
			website, our systems automatically switch to "secure" 
			mode. The following security features keep your data safe:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sophisticated, industry-leading encryption and authentication 
			technologies</li>
			<li>Website design that blocks or limits online display of customer 
			information when not necessary to you or the transaction</li>
			<li> IDs and passwords to protect sensitive information</li>
		</ul>
		<p><span class="heading2">Information we gather and communicate</span><br>
			When you order a product or service from Nationalcreditreport.com,
			we collect certain data online to verify your identity and process 
			your request. This is to protect you and to help eliminate identity 
			theft and fraudulent orders of credit information.</p>
		<p>In order to offer, provide and improve our products and services, 
			to comply with government regulations, and to better understand 
			your credit-related product and service needs, we collect and 
			maintain a range of customer and former customer data including 
			non-public personal information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>From applications and other forms (such as your name, phone, 
			Social Security and account numbers and property address)</li>
			<li> About your transactions with us, our affiliates and our business 
			partners (such as your loan balance, payment history and other 
			account information)</li>
			<li> From business partners, vendors and service companies (such 
			as your credit report from the national credit bureaus)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We are periodically required to disclose some of this data to 
			third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, and federal 
			and state regulators, in order to do business with you. We may 
			also share some of this information with companies that perform 
			services on our behalf (such as the mail house that prepares and 
			mails new product and service offers) and with third parties, 
			as otherwise required or permitted by law (such as to credit reporting 
			agencies or regulators). These business partners contractually 
			agree to keep the information confidential and not use it for 
			any other purpose.</p>
		<p>Additionally, in order to provide you with valuable product 
			and service offerings, we share limited amounts of this non-public 
			personal information (such as a list of customers in a certain 
			age range or geographic location) with well-respected business 
			partners who are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality 
			of your information.</p>
		<p><span class="heading2">You have choices</span><br>
			Because we respect your right to privacy, we give you the choice 
			of how your nonpublic personal information, other than credit 
			report information, may be shared. Remember, we do not share credit 
			report information except as permitted by law.</p>
		<p>You may choose to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Allow Nationalcreditreport.com to share limited amounts of
			your nonpublic personal information, other than credit report 
			information, outside Nationalcreditreport.com</li>
			<li>Limit such information sharing outside Nationalcreditreport.com</li>
			<li>Limit such information sharing within Nationalcreditreport.com.
			The process of limiting our ability to share your nonpublic 
			personal information, other than credit report information, 
			is called "opting out"</li>
		</ol>
		<p>We provide you three different options to consider, and have 
			a strong commitment to honor your request. They are to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Continue receiving valuable and convenient product 
			and service offers</strong><br>
			No action is required if you want to enjoy the benefits of valuable 
			product and service offers by allowing Nationalcreditreport.com
			to share limited amounts of your nonpublic personal information, 
			other than credit report information, within and outside Nationalcreditreport.com</li>
			<li><strong>Opt out of information sharing outside the Nationalcreditreport.com</strong><br>
			Making this decision will prevent us from sharing your nonpublic 
			personal information with our well-respected, carefully screened 
			business partners. This choice may limit our ability to inform 
			you of valuable and convenient products and services from partner 
			companies.<a href="javascript:MM_openBrWindow('optout.cfm?type=Outside','optout','status=yes','400','220','true')"> 
			Click here to OPT-OUT</a></li>
			<li><strong>Opt out of information sharing within the Nationalcreditreport.com</strong><br>
			Making this decision will prevent us from sharing your nonpublic 
			personal information within the Nationalcreditreport.com. This 
			choice may limit our ability to offer conveniences such as a 
			tailored savings quote on homeowners insurance, a custom financial 
			investment plan, other financial service offers and more. <a href="javascript:MM_openBrWindow('optout.cfm?type=Within','optout','status=yes','400','220','true')"> 
			Click here to OPT-OUT</a></li>
		</ol>
		<p>For products and services to multiple consumers, we will treat 
			an opt out by any consumer as applying to all consumers which 
			purchased one of our products or services. Please be aware that 
			even if you decide to opt out, Nationalcreditreport.com will continue
			to share nonpublic personal information with companies that perform 
			services on our behalf and with third parties as otherwise required 
			or permitted by law as well as share transactions and experience 
			(such as the type of credit-related product you ordered or your 
			payment history with us) within the Nationalcreditreport.com.</p>
		<p>In today's ever-changing, competitive market, opting-out may 
			mean missing timely information about money-saving products and
			services that help you accomplish your financial goals. It's something
			to think about carefully. We don't want you to miss any opportunities.</p>
		<p><em>Notice to Vermont Residents: Vermont law requires us to 
			have different practices for sharing information. We will not 
			share non-public personal information with anyone except as follows. 
			We will only share information with companies that perform services 
			on our behalf such as the marketing provider who may send out 
			promotional emails regarding our products and services (if we 
			have such vendor) and with third parties as otherwise required 
			or permitted by law such as a law enforcement agency who requests 
			data upon receipt of the appropriate lawful documentation, a credit 
			reporting agency or regulator.</em></p>
		<p><span class="heading2">Benefits of sharing within Nationalcreditreport.com<br></span>
			In order to continue offering and recommending valuable 
			financial products and services, we may share customer and former 
			customer information within the Nationalcreditreport.com. </p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>New Products and Services</strong><br>
			From time to time, the Nationalcreditreport.com may expand to 
			offer you new products and services by forming, acquiring or 
			merging with a new company</li>
		</ul>
		<p><span class="heading2">Benefits of sharing outside Nationalcreditreport.com</span><br>
			To make products and services available, often at substantial 
			savings to you, we may prudently share some customer and former 
			customer non-public personal information with business partners 
			under an agreement requiring that the information be kept confidential 
			and used only for those offers.</p>
