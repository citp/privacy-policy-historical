This policy (together with our [terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms-conditions.html "Terms & Conditions") and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By visiting our website or using our services you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this policy.

For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the "Act"), the data controller is NAH whose registered office is 1430 Montagu Court, Kettering Parkway, Kettering, NN15 6XR. Our registration number with the Information Commissioner's Office is Z4979903.

Whilst we always endeavour to obtain consent from the injured party before processing personal data, this is not always possible (e.g. when the accident victim is a child, non-English speaker, elderly/infirm relative). In these cases, it will be necessary to take details from a third party.  Where appropriate, we will always ask whether the injured party has consented to the processing of his/her information.  This can be evidenced by call recordings and the details of both the caller and injured party will be documented on our IT systems;
