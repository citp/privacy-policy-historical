# Privacy Policy | National Accident Helpline

## National Accident Helpline is committed to protecting your personal information. 

When you use our sites and services we want you to be confident that your personal information is safe and secure. This Privacy Policy explains the following:

  * how we collect your personal information
  * what personal information we collect
  * how we use your personal information
  * who we share your personal information with; and
  * your rights under General Data Protection Regulation.



## Who we are

We are National Accident Helpline Limited (company number 02857601) and our registered address is 1430 Montagu Court, Kettering Parkway, Kettering, NN15 6XR (referred to as “we” or “us” or “our”). We are registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office with registration number Z4979903 for the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”). Our Data Protection Officer can be contacted at [feedback@nahl.co.uk](mailto:feedback@nahl.co.uk).

This policy (together with our Privacy Notice and any other documents referred to in it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices about your personal data and how we will treat it.

A reference to “you” or “your” is a reference to a user of our site and/or our services.

## How we collect information about you

We may obtain personal information from you through our websites, mobile applications or other similar devices, channels or applications operated by, or on behalf of, any of the following brands:

  * National-Accident-Helpline.co.uk
  * Underdog.co.uk



If you request a call back or if you call us directly, we will store the information you give us. All calls to our contact centre are recorded for training and regulatory purposes.

## What personal information do we collect

**Information about you and your claim**

The information we collect may include your name, address, contact details (such as email address and phone number), date of birth, personal description and/or photograph, insurance details (which will include your name and address as well as other personal information), national insurance number, financial information, details regarding your health and injury and any other information relevant to your claim.

**Processing Data Provided by third Parties**

It’s important to us that our service is accessible to all accident victims. While we always try to get consent from the injured party before processing their personal data, this isn’t always possible (e.g. where the accident victim is a child, non-English speaker, elderly/infirm relative or where the injured party has consented to another person to provide his or her details to us). In these cases, it will be necessary for us to take details from a third party e.g. the parent of a child, translator, friend or relative. We will always ask the person providing the Personal Information whether the injured party has consented to the processing of their information.  The response to this question will be documented either by call recordings and/or noted on our internal systems. Information relating to the third party and the injured party will be collected by us in accordance with this policy.

**Website Cookies**

  * understand browsing habits on our sites;
  * understand the number of visitors to our sites and the pages visited; and
  * remember you when you return to our sites

## Storing your information

**Where we store your Information**

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this policy.

**Securing your Personal Information**

Your personal data’s security is very important to us. This is why, where it’s appropriate, our Sites use Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) to help keep information about you secure. However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we can’t guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we’ve received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

**How long do we store your Personal Information**

We may keep your information for a specified period to deal with any potential complaints and where you have provided the necessary consent, to track the progress of your claim based on information provided by your solicitor. Our retention periods are set out below. After this specified time period, we will take reasonable steps to remove and delete your information from our records and computer systems.

  * Where we transfer you through to one of our panel of Solicitors, we will keep a record of your personal data for a period of 7 years. After which we will delete all data and call recordings.
  * Where we were unable to help with your enquiry, we will keep any information which you share with us for a period of 12 months. After which we will delete all data and call recordings.
  * Provided you have given the necessary consent, all of the data returned to us by your panel firm will be kept for a period of 12 months. After which, all personal identifiable data will be deleted.
