## How we contact you   


### Email

You will receive updates on new products and offers from Natural Collection. We do not pass on your address to other organisations apart from Mailchimp for the purpose of marketing. Mailchimp are our email service provider that processes the sending of our emails. Mailchimp are one of the leading providers used by many businesses in the UK, you can read more about [Mailchimp’s security practices here](https://mailchimp.com/about/security/).

We may pass on your email to DPD, Hermes or Royal mail for delivery notification updates. These are service emails necessary for the delivery of your order and will not contain any marketing. These couriers will not pass on your email address to any third parties. 

You can opt out of email marketing at any time, either through your [My Preferences page](https://www.naturalcollection.com/account/account_newsletters.php), by simply clicking on the ‘Unsubscribe’ link which is at the bottom of all of our emails or by contacting our Customer Care team. (please note this might take a few days for all our systems to update). If you choose to opt out of marketing emails you will still receive order notification and delivery updates which are necessary for the delivery of your order as well as updates from DPD, Hermes or Royal mail but these emails will not contain any marketing. 

### Post

You can opt out of receiving catalogues by post by going to the [My Preferences page](https://www.naturalcollection.com/account/account_newsletters.php) and changing your preferences there or alternatively you can contact our Customer Care team. Please be aware due to the long timescales involved with printing catalogues you may still receive a catalogue if the process has already begun.

For the purpose of printing and delivering catalogues, address data is sent to our printing house [Pepper](https://pepper.co.uk/) and [ONEPOST](https://www.onepost.co.uk/) who manage the delivery and shipping of catalogues. We also share the data with [Basedata](http://www.basedata.co.uk/) for the purpose of suppression, de-duplication and address cleaning so we don’t send multiple catalogues to the same recipients. 

### Telephone   


We may from time to time wish to contact a small number of customers to conduct surveys or gather feedback on our products or services. You can opt out of this at any time on the [My Preferences page](https://www.naturalcollection.com/account/account_newsletters.php) or by contacting our Customer Care Team.

Please note if you have opted out of this we may still contact you to assist the processing of your order, for example if there is a problem with delivery. 

### Recommendations   


We have a huge range of products covering many categories so it is important that we show you the products that you are more interested in. This is why we have developed a recommendations system which will show product recommendations based on a number of factors such as previous purchases, what other customers bought and what products are popular right now. The data used for this is anonymised and is not shared with any other organisations. These recommendations will appear on Natural Collection and within our promotional emails. 

Adverts can also be displayed on third party websites for Natural Collection, these may show products you have viewed on our site.

To opt out of receiving product recommendations please visit the [My Preferences page](https://www.naturalcollection.com/account/account_newsletters.php).

### Third Party / Catalogue 

We work with Epsilon Abacus (registered as Epsilon International UK Ltd), a company that manages the Abacus Alliance on behalf of UK retailers. The participating retailers are active in the clothing, collectables, food & wine, gardening, gadgets & entertainment, health & beauty, household goods, and home interiors categories. They share information on what their customers buy. Epsilon Abacus analyses this pooled information to understand consumer's wider buying patterns. From this information, retailers can tailor their communications, sending people suitable offers that should be of interest to them, based on what they like to buy.

### Delivery and order processing 

To process your order we must pass on your details to Spark Response (our parent company) who manage our warehouse and ship orders. This will include your name, address, phone number, email and order details, you will only be contacted by Spark response in relation to your order. 

We use a number of courier services to get your order safely out to you. In order for this to be done we must supply these couriers with your name, address and telephone number and email address so they can complete the delivery and contact you if there are any problems with the delivery. These courier services do not own this data and so will not use it for any other purpose.

We currently use these courier services:

DPD - [Information Security Policy](https://www.dpd.com/de_en/siteutilities/data_protection)

Hermes - [Hermes Privacy Policy](https://www.myhermes.co.uk/privacy-policy.html)

Royal Mail - [Royal Mail Privacy Policy](https://www.royalmail.com/privacy-policy)

Some of the products on our site are sent on a ‘dropship’ basis , this means that they are sent out directly by the manufacturer rather than from our warehouse. If you order a product your delivery information will be passed on to the supplier so your order can be processed. These businesses do not own your data and will only contact you regarding your order.

### Payment Processing

  
When we process orders a fraud review is automatically conducted. If you chose to pay by card our payment provider Sage Pay will process the payment. For the purpose of processing the payment securely your name, address and order details are passed on to Sage Pay. When ordering with your credit or debit card we do not see or store your full card details, these are processed by Sage Pay.

If you choose to pay with PayPal we pass your name, address, email address and order details to PayPal. PayPal will confirm with us when the payment is completed through their systems. We do not see or store your bank or card details at any point in this process.

### Verified by Visa

Natural Collection is participating in Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode for added online payment security. These services are offered by Visa and MasterCard, in association with the bank that has issued your credit or debit card. It is aimed at protecting your details when shopping online by ensuring your card is not being used by someone else and is becoming a standard across all shopping websites.

If the credit or debit card you're using to pay for your order qualifies for one of these services (not all cards do), you will be taken to a page hosted by your card issuer. This is a completely secure process. The information you provide is completely private, will only be visible to you and your card issuer, and would never be shared with other parties.

If you haven't registered before and your card qualifies, you will need to follow the on-screen instructions to register securely and create a password for your card. This is not the same as the PIN number you use for your regular shopping. It's an online shopping code that you'll be able to use to identify yourself and your card when shopping online on NaturalCollection.com or any other participating websites. It's the online equivalent of chip and pin which is used on the High Street. Once registered, you will be taken back to Natural Collection to confirm your order. If you're unsure about this new service, you may be able to complete your order without registering but we recommend that you contact your card issuer to find out more about the service, as they will eventually require you to register to continue shopping online.

If you have already registered, you will be required to use your password on future online transactions.

If you would like to learn more about these services or have any difficulty with the process, please contact your card issuer who should be able to assist you, as NaturalCollection.com are unfortunately not able to help. Alternatively, you can always place your order by calling our Customer service team. 

### Reviews

To help us monitor how good our service and products are, we send data to our independent reviews partner eKomi who will request a review after you have made a purchase on our site.  If you decide to leave a review your data will be processed by eKomi for the purpose of showing this review.  For the purpose of this we will pass on your email address, name and products purchased. For any product reviews you leave, your first name and last initial will be displayed on our site. Your review will be available to view on the eKomi website, and may also be published on ours.
