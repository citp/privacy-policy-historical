#### Our Uses of the Information You Provide 

We share Protected Information you provide to us via the Website only as provided in this Policy. We collect information from Site Visitors and Subscribers at different points on our Website and through our Services, and use this information as follows: 

3.1.Registration Information; User Names. In order to participate as a Subscriber in our services, we require that you complete a registration form. This form asks for Contact Information, which includes such items as (i) name; (ii) mailing address; and (iii) email address. The registration process for certain services - for example services relying on Credit Reports - require a Subscriber to provide Personal Information, including his or her social security number. We use the information a Subscriber provides during the registration process (i) to provide a Subscriber with a user name and a password, to allow the Subscriber to gain access to Password Protected Areas of the Site; and (ii) to provide the goods and services the Subscriber has requested. We use Contact Information the Subscriber provides during the registration process, as further detailed below. 

3.2.Verifying Identity. When you order a product or service from NationalCreditReport.com™, we may collect additional Personal Information online to verify your identity and process your request, beyond the data you provided during registration. This is designed to further protect you and to reduce the threat of identity theft and fraudulent orders of credit information.

3.3.Email Addresses. We use your e-mail address to send notifications relating to our Site, and the goods and services you have requested. In addition, we may use your email address, and other Contact Information, for the uses detailed below. 

3.4.Contact Information. To offer you all the greatest advantages as a NationalCreditReport.com™ Subscriber, we find that sharing your Contact Information (expressly excluding your Personal Information), within our NationalCreditReport.com™ family of companies and with business partners enables us to offer you personalized products and services at lower costs and/or much greater convenience than otherwise would be possible. Accordingly, we will provide your Contact Information to our NationalCreditReport.com™ family of companies, and to our business partners. If you would prefer that we not share your Contact Information in this manner, please notify us via our "opt-out" mechanism, described in Section 9 (Your Choices; Opting Out), and we will remove you from this service. 

3.5.Account Transactions. We collect information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, and our business partners (such as your loan balance, payment history and other account information). We use this information in evaluating the types of goods and services you may find useful, in making business judgments concerning continuing a relationship with you, and for other business purposes. We may share this Contact Information with our affiliates and business partners, as provided in Section 3.4 (Contact Information). 

3.6.Promotions. We believe that our Subscribers' own experiences on the Site can often act as the strongest promotion for our products and services. To promote and illustrate our products and services, we may wish to post on our home page, on other areas of a website, or elsewhere, endorsements from, or other descriptions of experiences by, our Subscribers. You agree that your Contact Information and site-related experiences may be used and adapted for these purposes (without the need for compensation). 

3.7.Informational Notices and Bulletins. Periodically, we may choose to send news, bulletins, or other information to Users, and will use Contact Information to send such communications. If we choose to undertake such communications, you will have the ability to opt out of receiving these communications as provided in Section 9 (Your Choices; Opting Out). 

3.8.Surveys. Periodically, we may initiate surveys on our Site, and we may request Contact Information or other Protected Information from you in connection with such surveys. You are free to choose whether you participate in this type of survey. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and appeal of this Site, and for other business purposes. We will notify you of relevant details in connection with asking for you participation in such surveys. 

#### Credit Report Information Received From Others 

The information you provide will enable us to obtain Credit Report Information (including a Credit Report) on your behalf from the national Credit Reporting agencies. NationalCreditReport.com™ does not share Credit Report Information except as permitted by law. As stated elsewhere on our Site, you have the right to obtain free Credit Report annually. Please follow the associated directions, if you wish to obtain free reports directly from the Credit Reporting agencies. 

#### Anonymous, Aggregate Information

We use Anonymous Information to analyze the effectiveness of our Site, to improve our services, and for other similar purposes. In addition, from time to time, we may undertake or commission statistical and other summary analyses of the general behavior and characteristics of Users participating in our services and the characteristics of visitors at our Site, and may share Anonymous Information with third parties, including advertisers (if any). Rest assured, though, that Anonymous Information provided to third parties will not allow anyone to identify you, or determine anything personal about you. We may collect Anonymous Information through features of the software that supports our services, through cookies, and through other means described below. 

5.1.IP Addresses; Logs. Either directly, or through our hosting service provider, we may automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address (the Internet address of your PC), your computer's name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses, where the computer is routing from, and other generally-accepted log information. We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information, which will be aggregated with that of other users in order to understand how our Website is being used, and for security and monitoring purposes. 

5.2.Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use a website upon a future visit. We may include cookies on our Website and use them to recognize you when you return to our Website. You may set your browser so that it does not accept cookies. Cookies must be enabled on your web browser, however, if you wish to access certain personalized features of our Services. 

5.3.Tags. We may use so-called "pixel tags" -- small graphic images (also know as "web beacons", "single-pixel GIFS", or "Web bugs") -- for purposes such as (i) to tell us what parts of our website have been visited, (ii) in connection with advertisements we may include on the Site, (iii) to measure the effectiveness of searches you perform on our Site, and (iv) for other purposes. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format you can read, and they inform us whether emails have been opened, to help ensure that our messages are of interest to our Subscribers and other. None of this data includes Protected Information, and you can "opt-out" of receiving these types of emails from us by following the directions provided in Section 9 (Your Choices; Opting Out). If any Protected Information is collected using such tools, it will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

5.4.Click-Throughs. We may send email messages which use a "click-through URL" linked to content on our Website. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply do not click text or graphic links in the email, or notify us in accordance with Section 9 (Your Choices; Opting Out). 

5.5.Banner Ads; Advertising Profiles. Our Site may include the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party ad service provider or advertiser ("Advertisers"). These Advertisers may use traditional banner ads, or other advertising methods, such as advertising using profiles and related content. An Advertiser may place or utilize its own cookie on your browser, and may use Anonymous Information about your visit to our Site, such as the number of times you have viewed the advertisement. If the Advertiser requests that you provide to it Protected Information, please be aware that this Advertiser's use and collection of this information will be governed by its own privacy policy, and not our Policy. We recommend that you review the Advertiser's privacy policy before providing Personal Information. 

#### Use of Comments 

Comments you provide to us, to the extent they contain Protected Information, are covered by this Privacy Policy. Those portions of your Comments that do not contain Protected Information do not fall under this Policy, and instead are subject to the Code of Conduct and other provisions of our Terms of Use.

#### Any Information Linked With Your Personal Information Is Protected As "Personal Information"

To enable us to better understand your characteristics and/or to provide services tailored to your needs, we may link (a) the Protected Information you have provided; with (b) Anonymous Information. If we combine or link any Anonymous Information or other information with your Protected Information, the resulting combination will be treated and protected as Protected Information under this Privacy Policy. 

#### Disclosures to Third Parties 

At our option, we will disclose or share your protected information to unaffiliated third party marketers who will use the data for their marketing purposes, without your express consent in the circumstances specified below:

8.1.Site Vendors.

We may need to share your Protected Information with companies that assist in the running of our Site (collectively, "Site Vendors"). We will provide Site Vendors with only that Protected Information necessary to perform their functions, and we will not allow them to use your Protected Information for any purpose inconsistent with this Policy. We require that our Site Vendors agree contractually to comply with privacy laws, and agree to maintain protections for your Protected Information that are consistent with this Policy. 

8.2.Government Regulators. We are periodically required to disclose certain Protected Information to third parties, such as Credit Reporting agencies, and federal and state regulators, in order to do business with you. 

8.3.Business Partners. In order to provide you with valuable product and service offerings, we share Contact Information (including lists of Users in a certain age range or geographic location) with our "3rd party" business partners, for their marketing purposes. We require that our business partners agree contractually to comply with privacy laws, and agree to maintain protections for your Protected Information that are consistent with this Policy. You have the ability to "opt-out" of this information-sharing, by following the directions provided in Section 9 (Your Choices; Opting Out). 

8.4.Affiliates. Similar to the structure with out business partners, we share Contact Information with our Affiliates -- within the NationalCreditReport.com™ family of companies -- in order to provide you with valuable product and service offerings. Our Affiliates have agreed contractually to comply with privacy laws, and have agreed to maintain protections for your Protected Information that are consistent with this Policy. You have the ability to "opt-out" of this information-sharing, by following the directions provided in Section 9 (Your Choices; Opting Out). 

8.5.Questions of Harm. We may reveal your Protected Information on a case-by-case basis to attorneys, private investigator organizations or law enforcement agencies if we believe (a) that you are in risk of harm from another, or (b) that you are harming or interfering (or will harm or interfere) with others, or are violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Terms of Use or are otherwise violating legal obligations.   
8.6.Legal. We will reveal your Protected Information, to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law. If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of your Protected Information we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request, unless such notification is not permitted. 

8.7.Transfer of Site. We shall be entitled to transfer Protected Information to a third party in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the business entity responsible for the information under this Policy, provided the acquiring third party has agreed to safeguard your Protected Information with protections that in all material respects are the same as or more protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy. 

#### Your Choices, Opting Out

Because we respect your right to privacy, we give you the choice of how your Contact Information may be shared. Remember, we do not share Credit Report Information or Personal Information except as permitted by law. Moreover, you have the following choices with respect to use of your Contact Information: 

9.1.Opting-Out of Updates. If we choose to send to you bulletins, updates, product offerings, or other communications, we will provide you with the ability to decline -- or "opt-out of" - receiving such communications. Instructions for opting-out will be provided if and when we determine to send you such a communication. Please understand that you will not be allowed to "opt-out" of formal notices concerning operation of this Website, and legal and other related notices concerning your relationship to the Site. 

9.2.Opting-Out of Information-Sharing. You may choose to opt-out of our sharing information with business partners. Making this decision will prevent us from sharing your Contact Information with our business partners, and your choice may limit our ability to inform you of valuable and convenient products and services from these business partners. You may similarly choose to opt out of our information-sharing within the NationalCreditReport.com™ family of companies. Making this decision will prevent us from sharing your Contact Information with our Affiliates, and this choice may limit our ability to offer conveniences such as a tailored savings quote on homeowners insurance, a custom financial investment plan, other financial service offers, and more. 

9.3.Opting-Out and Multiple Subscribers. For products and services that were ordered by a single Subscriber, but that apply to multiple Subscribers or other individuals, we will treat an opt out by any Subscriber as applying to all Subscribers (or others) covered by the products or service. 

9.4.Opt-Out Considerations. In today's ever-changing, competitive market, opting-out may mean missing timely information about money-saving products and services that help you accomplish your financial goals. It's something to think about carefully. We don't want you to miss any opportunities. No "opt-out" action is required if you want to enjoy the benefits of valuable product and service offers by allowing NationalCreditReport.com™ to share Contact Information with affiliates and business partners.
