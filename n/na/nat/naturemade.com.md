CONSENT TO TRANSFER _POLICY CHANGES_ This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically, and we will post any new or revised policies on this Site. We recommend that you carefully read our Privacy Policy whenever you visit our Site. Pharmavite will use your personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you consent to the new or revised policy. _THIS SITE IS INTENDED FOR ADULT USE_ This Site is not designed or intended to attract persons under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not use this Site. We do not collect personal information from any person we know is under the age of 18. **By using this Site, you acknowledge that you are 18 years or older.** _INFORMATION WE COLLECT_ ** _Personally Identifiable Information_**

Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to identify you personally, and it may include your name, e-mail address, and street address. We may also ask you for or give you the opportunity to supply other information about yourself, such as your age, gender, and similar information (including weight, height and health related information). We may collect this information in one or a variety of ways, including: 

  * when you create a Wellness Account; 
  * when you use various interactive tools and services, such as the Wellness Advisor or the "Email an Expert" feature on naturemade.com; 
  * when you participate in surveys, sweepstakes or contests or respond to questionnaires and the like; 
  * when you make submissions to us, such as your success story or testimonial; 
  * when you participate in any special offers or coupons being offered; 
  * when you request information from us, including general or product inquiries; 
  * when you contact us; or 
  * when you e-mail a page from this Site to a friend. Please note that in this situation the e-mail addresses you or your friend supply to us will not be used to send 

you or your friend other e-mail communications unless disclosed at the time you provide the information. You can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Site's features, such the interactive content provided on this Site. **If you provide us with your personally identifiable information you are consenting to our use and disclosure of such information consistent with this Privacy Policy and the[Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/UserAccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp).**

We may also receive information about you from other sources. For example, we may collect information about you in connection with a promotion offered on a third-party web site or you may provide information to another Pharmavite web site or offline to Pharmavite. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information that we collect through this Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personally identifiable information that we receive. 

You are responsible for the accuracy of your personally identifiable information. You submit the information; Pharmavite retains it as received. When you update or correct your personally identifiable information, such updated and corrected information is also retained by Pharmavite as received. 

**_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_**

We also collect non-personally identifiable information from you through the use of technology, which may include "cookies" and pixel tags (or clear "gifs"). Because of the nature of such technology, it may not be apparent to you that such non-personally identifiable information is being collected. For example, our web server will typically collect the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the lengths of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting the Site, and IP addresses. 

**_IP Addresses_**

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to you whenever you access the Internet and is often associated with the place where you enter the Internet like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. This IP address may be the same each time you access the Internet or it may change. We may associate your IP address with the personally identifiable information you provide. In addition, we may use your IP address to identify you in cooperation with internet service providers or law enforcement at their request or when we feel necessary to protect the site or the public. 

**_Cookies; Pixel Tags, and Similar Technologies_**

"Cookies" are pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer and puts on your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the web site. "Cookies" tell us how often someone visits our Site and the activities they conduct while on our Site (such as the places you visited, etc.). "Cookies" can also be used to store personal preferences for your convenience and to track user trends and patterns. The information collected by "cookies" can help us better understand and improve areas of this Site and our products that our users find valuable. 

Cookies alone do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information. Nevertheless, once you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information, we may combine it with information collected by the cookie. 

Your browser software can be set to reject all "cookies" or to warn you each time a cookie is being sent. You do this through your browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to reject "cookies" or receive warnings about "cookies." If you reject our "cookies," some of our Site's functionality may not work properly. 

The Site or our e-mail messages may also use pixel tags, which are also called clear "gifs" (or similar technologies as they become available), which are small graphic images that allow the party that set the pixel tag to monitor and collect certain information about the viewer of a web page, web-based document or e-mail message, such as the type of browser requesting the pixel tag, the IP address of the computer that the pixel tag is sent to and the time the pixel tag was viewed. We use the information collected by pixel tags for a variety of internal purposes, such as targeting future advertising campaigns, upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics, and to count how many e-mail messages that we sent were actually read. We may combine the information we collect in this way with your personally identifiable information. 

Third-party advertisers or content providers on this Site may also set their own "cookies" or pixel tags. Pharmavite does not control these third parties' use of these technologies or how they manage the information they gather through them. 

**_Embedded Code_**

We use a tracking utility called WebTrends which uses IP addresses and codes embedded in our Site to gather non-personally identifiable information about Site usage and movement. This data is then analyzed and used for improving user experience and promoting our products. You should refer to the WebTrends Privacy Policy to learn how they collect and use information. You can find WebTrends privacy policy at: [http://www.webtrends.com](http://www.webtrends.com/)

 _PUBLIC FORUMS_ As a service to our users, this Site may feature chat rooms, message or discussion boards and forums. Please review our restrictions on use and guidelines for public forums in our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.naturemade.com/UserAccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp). **Please remember that any information (including personal and medical information) that you reveal in a public forum on this Site becomes public information and is not protected by this Privacy Policy.** In addition, certain message boards (and similar user forums) may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Pharmavite is not responsible for the actions or policies of any third parties who collect and disclose information that you may provide in forums or other public areas of this Site. If you are asked to create a user name, you may not wish to use your real name or other information that can be used to identify you. In addition, do not use the real name of another person when selecting a user name. _HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION_ Pharmavite uses personally identifiable information to complete transactions, address requests for our products, programs and services (including, without limitation, creation of your nutrition calculators, health calculators and prevention calculators), respond to your inquiries, notify you if you've won one of our sweepstakes or contests, contact you in connection with your Wellness Rewards account, provide you with relevant content and information, or for other purposes disclosed at the time you provide your personally identifiable information. 

If you do not opt-out of receiving information from the Site, we use the information collected to communicate with you and to promote Pharmavite's products. For example, we may use such information to send you e-mail updates and newsletters about our products, to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you, including e-mails relating to your health interests, or to send you e-mail promotions and special offers from us, our advertisers, third-party business partners, or other third parties. 

If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., success stories with our products, testimonials regarding our product, and/or photographs), we may publish such submissions. If we chose to publish such information (including your photograph and/or likeness and any health related information in your submission), we may also publish your name, screen name and other related information on our Site; you should review our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.naturemade.com/UserAccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp/UserAccount/uar_TermsConditions.asp) as to the rights that you are giving us by making any such submission. 

We use non-personally identifiable information that we collect or that is collected by WebTrends On Demand for internal purposes, such as to analyze Site usage and movement, to improve the design, content and offerings of our Site and to personalize your Internet experience. We may share non-personally identifiable information about our users, such as aggregate statistics, with advertisers, third party business partners and other third parties. 

_DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION_ Pharmavite may disclose your personally identifiable information and any other information you have provided, including health related information ("User Information") to entities wholly-owned by us.
