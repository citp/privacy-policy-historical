<br>The most browsers are set by default to accept cookies automatically. But you can disable cookies being storing or configure your browser in a way that it notifies you before storing cookies. As you can only make full use of the most of our interesting features with cookies being enabled, we recommend leaving the cookie function on.

Information Transfer To Third Parties" title="6. Information Transfer To Third Parties"><p class="text-0">The careful handling of your personal information is important to us. It is by no ways our business to sell this information. We hand over information that we receive to third parties solely for the purposes described in the following: 
<br>
<br><strong>1.</strong> In some cases NATIVE INSTRUMENTS is required by law to disclose information to third parties. In particular when a crime or abuse is suspected, NATIVE INSTRUMENTS is obliged to disclose information to law enforcement authorities. This includes exchanging information with companies that inquire credit card abuse. No personal data is passed if companies want to use them commercially. 
<br>
<br><strong>2.</strong> We assign other service providers, partner companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include payment processing (credit card, direct debit), analysis of our databases, handling newsletters and other promotional activities as well as analysis and documentation of our site visits (see chapter 7.a Google Analytics, 7.b „interest-based advertising and 7.c Facebook). 
<br>
<br>These service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their tasks. However, the may not use them for any other purposes. They are also obliged to treat the information in accordance with this privacy policy and the German data protection laws. For this reason, we try to assign service providers who are bound to the German data protection regulations, or at least to the European data protection rules. 
<br>
<br>As part of a credit card and credit assessment your name and your address are passed to such a company, whereas your rights are respected in strict accordance with statutory provisions. In charge of this: Acceptance Lufthansa Airplus GmbH, Odenwaldstrasse 19, 63263 Neu Isenburg. 
<br>
<br><strong>3.</strong> As we continuously develop our business, it may occur that we sell or buy individual subsidiaries, business units or parts of them. In such transactions, customer information is usually transferred together with the transferred part of the company. Your data are further subject to the previously existing privacy statement. The only exception is the case that you explicitly agree to other provisions. In the unlikely event that all or substantial parts of NATIVE INSTRUMENTS are sold, personal information will be passed on to the buyer. 
<br>
<br><strong>4.</strong> In all other cases, we will inform you when personal information should be disclosed to third parties, and give you the opportunity to give your consent.

Our employees are intensively informed and trained and commit themselves to the data confidentiality. This ensures that your data are kept confidential. We can particularly ensure that your data is protected because we provide our customer service through our own staff and not by third parties. Thereby controls and effective training are possible. 
<br>
<br><strong>2.</strong> To protect your personal data during transmission to our servers, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software. This encrypts all information you transmit to us. 
<br>
<br><strong>3.</strong> When confirming an order, we reveal only the last five digits of your credit card number. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate companies while processing the order. 
<br>
<br><strong>4.</strong> Furthermore, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information. Part of these security measures is that we occasionally may ask you to provide proof of your identity before we disclose personal information. 
<br>
<br><strong>5.</strong> We would like to point out that it is important to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. If you share your computer with others (notably for computers in public areas such as Internet cafés and libraries), you should make sure to logout after each session. 
<br>
<br><strong>6.</strong> Despite these actions, there is no 100% guarantee against unauthorized third parties gaining access to your data. Consequently, we have to point out that every transmission of data over the Internet is at your own risk.
