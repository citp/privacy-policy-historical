Beyond that we use your information to improve our platform, to prevent or uncover abuse, particularly fraud or to allow third parties to exercise technical, logistic or other services on our behalf. 
<br>
<br>
<br></p><a id="c26359"></a><div class="clearFloat">&nbsp;</div><h2>4. Information We Collect</h2><p class="text-0">
<br>We act according to the principle of data parsimony and data avoidance, i.e. we collect and use only the most necessary data for processing your order or product registration and for the communication with you. 
<br>
<br>You can visit our web site without leaving personal data: When surfing without logging in we do not collect any personal data but merely place a cookie. By default information such as your IP address, time and duration of your visit, operating system, browser and visited sites are captured. 
<br>
<br>If you register as a customer we collect your data via the registration form you fill in, among others your name, your address including e-mail, the details of your desired method of payment, your credit card number if this applies, and the details on your regarding order. Different cookies will be created in this case as well (refer to chapter 5 for details on the cookies). 
<br>
<br>We store your order data within the ordering history and send the order data to you via e-mail. The terms and conditions can be found <a href="en/company/legal-information/terms-and-conditions/" class="internal-link ">here</a>. 
<br>
<br>When registering a product via the Service Center or the web site, data about the registered product, your hardware and the used serial number is stored. On initial registration your e-mail address and your postal address and your preferred language are stored as well. 
<br>
<br>Furthermore, the data you voluntarily enter on initial registration in the Service Center’s online profile is stored. 
<br>
<br>We also sporadically send out surveys on specific questions regarding NATIVE INSTRUMENTS and its products. If you take part in these campaigns, your e-mail address and your answers will be stored. 
<br>
<br>Finally, we need information on your person, at least your e-mail address in the following cases: 
<br>
<br></p><ul><li>if you register for the delivery of a newsletter or comparable promotional material. See chapter 10. for this.</li>
<br><li>if you use our support services. In this case the data you enter into the form about your hardware and software is stored and used for follow-up, i.e. if use support a further time.</li> 
<br><li>if you participate in one of our competitions or other marketing campaigns.</li>
<br><li>if you get in touch with us for other reasons.</li></ul> 
<br><p></p><a id="c26360"></a><div class="clearFloat">&nbsp;</div><h2>5. What Exactly Are Cookies?</h2><p class="text-0">
<br>Cookies are alphanumerical identifiers, small text files we transmit to the hard disk of your computer via your web browser or other programs. They enable NATIVE INSTRUMENTS’ systems to recognize your browser and offer you different services. No security relevant or personal data will be stored. Furthermore, cookies cannot transmit viruses, spy out data on your computer or send e-mails without your notice. Also, every web server can only read cookies it has set itself. 
<br>
<br>Using our web site without cookies being set is possible under certain conditions; a purchase in the shop unfortunately does not work without the possibility of setting cookies. 
<br>
<br>The most browsers are set by default to accept cookies automatically. But you can disable cookies being storing or configure your browser in a way that it notifies you before storing cookies. As you can only make full use of the most of our interesting features with cookies being enabled, we recommend leaving the cookie function on. 
<br>
<br>Furthermore we recommend completely signing off after using a computer you share with other users if this machine is configured in a way it accepts cookies. This particularly applies to computers in public spaces, such as internet cafés or libraries. In this case we highly recommend completely signing off so that no data remain recognizable for the next user. 
<br>
<br>
<br></p><a id="c26361"></a><div class="clearFloat">&nbsp;</div><h2>6. Information Transfer To Third Parties</h2><p class="text-0">
<br>The careful handling of your personal information is important to us. It is by no ways our business to sell this information. We hand over information that we receive to third parties solely for the purposes described in the following: 
<br>
<br><strong>1.</strong> In some cases NATIVE INSTRUMENTS is required by law to disclose information to third parties. In particular when a crime or abuse is suspected, NATIVE INSTRUMENTS is obliged to disclose information to law enforcement authorities. This includes exchanging information with companies that inquire credit card abuse. No personal data is passed if companies want to use them commercially. 
<br>
<br><strong>2.</strong> We assign other service providers, partner companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include payment processing (credit card, direct debit), analysis of our databases, handling newsletters and other promotional activities as well as analysis and documentation of our site visits (see chapter 7.a Google Analytics, 7.b „interest-based advertising", 7.c KISSMetrics and 7.d Facebook). 
<br>
<br>These service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their tasks. However, the may not use them for any other purposes. They are also obliged to treat the information in accordance with this privacy policy and the German data protection laws. For this reason, we try to assign service providers who are bound to the German data protection regulations, or at least to the European data protection rules. 
<br>
<br>As part of a credit card and credit assessment your name and your address are passed to such a company, whereas your rights are respected in strict accordance with statutory provisions. In charge of this: Acceptance Lufthansa Airplus GmbH, Odenwaldstrasse 19, 63263 Neu Isenburg. 
<br>
<br><strong>3.</strong> As we continuously develop our business, it may occur that we sell or buy individual subsidiaries, business units or parts of them. In such transactions, customer information is usually transferred together with the transferred part of the company. Your data are further subject to the previously existing privacy statement. The only exception is the case that you explicitly agree to other provisions. In the unlikely event that all or substantial parts of NATIVE INSTRUMENTS are sold, personal information will be passed on to the buyer. 
<br>
<br><strong>4.</strong> In all other cases, we will inform you when personal information should be disclosed to third parties, and give you the opportunity to give your consent. 
<br>
<br>

<br></p><a id="c26364"></a><div class="clearFloat">&nbsp;</div><h2>7.d Facebook – Social Plug-ins</h2><p class="text-0">
<br>Native Instruments´ website uses plug-ins of the social network Facebook (www.facebook.com). The plug-ins are marked with a company logo of Facebook or the addition "Facebook Social Plug-in.

<br>
<br>
<br></p><a id="c26365"></a><div class="clearFloat">&nbsp;</div><h2>8. Security Of Your Data</h2><p class="text-0">
<br><strong>1.</strong> We have developed organizational and technical measures to reliably protect the data received from you. Our employees are intensively informed and trained and commit themselves to the data confidentiality. This ensures that your data are kept confidential. We can particularly ensure that your data is protected because we provide our customer service through our own staff and not by third parties. Thereby controls and effective training are possible. 
<br>
<br><strong>2.</strong> To protect your personal data during transmission to our servers, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software. This encrypts all information you transmit to us. 
<br>
<br><strong>3.</strong> When confirming an order, we reveal only the last five digits of your credit card number. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate companies while processing the order. 
<br>
<br><strong>4.</strong> Furthermore, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information. Part of these security measures is that we occasionally may ask you to provide proof of your identity before we disclose personal information. 
<br>
<br><strong>5.</strong> We would like to point out that it is important to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password and your computer.
