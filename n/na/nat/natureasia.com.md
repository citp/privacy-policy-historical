We may use the personal information you provide on our website for internal purposes, such as for website administration, data analytics and compliance purposes.

Non-Personal Information We Collect

We collect certain aggregated and non-personal information when you visit our website. Aggregated and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable visitor. It tells us information such as how many users visited our website and which pages were accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors. We collect this information either through "cookie" technology or with "web beacons", as explained below.

Cookies  
Like many companies, we use "cookies" on our website(s). Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.  
Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all our website features. 

Web Beacons  
Certain pages on our websites contain "web beacons" (also know as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs or java script equivalents). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.

### Information We Share

We do not sell or otherwise disclose information about our website visitors, except as described here. We may share the information you provide with affiliates of Nature (i.e. companies in our group) and our joint marketing partners. We may also share the information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. These service providers are not authorised by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement agencies following an appropriate request or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use information you have provided through our website(s) in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

### How We Protect Personal Information

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information you provide on our websites.

### Access and Correction

Nature will provide website users with access to a copy of their personal information which they have provided through our site(s), where such users are reasonably entitled to ask for this, (for which we may charge a small fee not exceeeding the statutory maximum) and they will have the ability to review and correct it, as applicable. To help protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your information.

### Your Choices

If you would like to update your contact information, preferences, or be removed from a mailing list, you can do so on the '[My Account](http://www.natureasia.com/en/myaccount/edit/)' page.

### Updates to Our Privacy Policy

This policy may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our online information practices.
