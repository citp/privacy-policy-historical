We are committed to protecting your privacy during your visits to the NatWest International website and recognise our responsibility to keep the information you provide to us confidential at all times.

We protect your personal information on the Internet to an equivalent high standard to that you experience through any other channels through which we may interact with you, such as our branches, cash machines or on the telephone.

The Royal Bank of Scotland International Limited is owned by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and your personal information will not be disclosed outside the group except in circumstances advised to you at the time you apply for a product or service.

Strict security procedures are followed in the storage and disclosure of your personal information.

When personal information is requested on-line by us, we ensure that your browser encrypts it.

 **1\. Cookies**

A 'cookie' is information that a website stores on your computer so that it can remember something about you at a later time. Cookies are commonly used on the Internet and do not harm your system.

The cookies used on the NatWest International website do not include any information that others could read and understand about you, such as your name or account numbers.   
We currently use a combination of first party, third party, permanent and temporary cookies in the following ways:

  * To collate general, non-personal management information which is used to plan enhancements to our services. For example, cookies help us to understand the popular paths that users take through the NatWest International website and how often people visit. Some of our general management information is collected using third party tracking code provided by Red Sheriff. We do not share information with other companies that use the same third party tracking code or combine any data collected by Red Sheriff with any personal information collected on the NatWest International website.   
[For more information about how Red Sheriff collects data, please read the Red Sheriff Privacy Policy](http://www.redsheriff.com/uk/content/privacy_1.html "www.redsheriff.com. Opens in a new window").
  * To evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions on third party websites, we use DoubleClick as an agent for promotion delivery and measurement. The Bank owns the anonymous data that is collected and it is not shared with DoubleClick, or any other third party.   
[For more information about how DoubleClick collects data, please read the DoubleClick Privacy Policy](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/ "http://www.doubleclick.com. Opens in a new window").
  * As a flag to help us recognise when we have already asked you to participate in any on-line market research and to prevent you from being asked to complete the same questionnaire everytime that you visit the NatWest International website. 



If you do not want us to use cookies when you visit the NatWest International website, you can configure your browser not to accept them or opt-out. Please refer to your browser's 'help' facility, [Red Sheriff](http://www.redsheriff.com/uk/content/privacy_1.html "www.redsheriff.com.

For example, in accordance with standard banking practice, we will tell you that we will provide information about you to credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.

**3\. NatWest OnLine Banking - Banking Instructions**

You can use our secure NatWest OnLine Banking Service to access your account with us. When you do so we ensure that your instructions are provided to us in a secure and confidential manner after you have identified yourself by "logging in" to NatWest OnLine Banking.
