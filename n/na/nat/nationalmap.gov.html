  <p id="cookies"><strong>Cookies</strong> - Some applications may save a “cookie” on your computer's hard disk to provide a temporary history of actions taken. Cookies are small text files that a web site transfers to your computer to allow the site to remember specific information. If you do not want cookies to be transferred to your computer, you may choose to opt out by <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml" title="Modifying your browser options" target="_blank">modifying your browser options</a>.  Opting out of cookies in no way diminishes your access to information or services. </p>
  <p>Session cookies do not contain Personally Identifiable Information. Once a browser is closed, the cookies disappear. An example of a session cookie used on some USGS Web sites is the ForeSee Results' American Customer Satisfaction Index survey. </p>
  <p> 
    Persistent cookies store information on your computer for longer periods of time. USGS may use persistent cookies on some web sites to improve online services. These persistent cookies do not contain personally identifiable information. USGS does not use persistent cookies that contain Personally Identifiable Information unless specifically stated on the Web page and the visitor has provided explicit consent.</p>
  <p id="email"><strong>Email or Web Forms</strong> - When you send us personal identifying information by contacting us via e-mail (that is, in a message containing a question or comment) or by filling out a form that e-mails us this information, we use it to respond to your requests. We may forward your e-mail or information to other Government employees or contract personnel who are better able to answer your questions.</p>
  <p>We do not retain or distribute lists of e-mail addresses to any parties outside the USGS, except as necessary to conduct official U.S. Government business, and we do not distribute lists of e-mail addresses to non-Government entities.  Information collected via e-mail or Web form will be retained at our discretion in a readable form for as long as necessary to complete our response. The e-mail or information may be retained in an archival form as required by Federal laws and regulations governing the retention of historical records of Government agencies.

  <p id="ftp"><strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</strong> - Many USGS sites using the file transfer protocol may also store your e-mail address if your Web browser is configured to provide it. By default, most Web browser software does not send your e-mail address; this option is configured through your browser preferences. </p>
  <p id="surveys"><strong>Online Surveys</strong> - When you voluntarily provide us with personal information as part of an online survey, we use it to perform various quantitative and qualitative analyses to improve customer service and satisfaction. We may forward the information collected to other Government employees or contract personnel to perform the actual analysis. You are under no obligation to participate in such surveys. Non-participation will not inhibit your use of our Web site in any way. If you provided the information to us in error, you may request its removal at any time. Information collected via online surveys may be retained at our discretion for an indefinite period of time. </p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="third-party"><strong>Third Party Websites and Applications</strong></h3>
<p>The USGS utilizes some third-party websites and applications that are not exclusively operated or controlled by a government entity and are not subject to the USGS Privacy Policy.  Often these technologies are located on a “.com” website or other location that is not part of an official government domain.  All users are encouraged to review the applicable third-party privacy policy, evaluate any potential risks and assess periodically thereafter.  Personal Identifiable Information (PII) as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may be minimally collected by USGS to accomplish a purpose required by statute, regulation or executive order.  In the event that USGS collects PII from a third-party website or application, the USGS Privacy  Officer must approve the collection, and the public will be notified via a Federal Register comment period which will contain the type of information being collected, the intended purpose of the collection, the retention period, as well as any other specifics. </p>

<p id="storify"><strong>Storify</strong> - Storify allows us to curate social media and other publicly available content into a "story" which helps to show useful information and content based on an event that occurred or a specific topic. For example, we may create a Storify article which pulls together different content shared on social media sites or websites related to a specific earthquake event. This article would help us tell a story for the event that occurred, what was said, video or other multimedia from the event, etc.</p>
<p>Storify allows publishers to notify people who have their social media content  has been  added to a story, via Twitter, when they're posts have been used. This is an optional feature. If weÂ&nbsp;choose to tweet notifications mentioning users whose content has been added to a USGS Storify article, then they will receive a public tweet linking to the Storify article which show their publicly posted content.</p>
<p>We will not require visitors to its Storify pages to register or submit PII to view content. Users who choose to engage further within the Storify environment will log in with either their Facebook, Twitter, or Storify credentials. These credentials are not provided to  USGS. The only information made available to  us are the listing of followers of USGS Storify page(s) which is publicly available in a similar fashion to how Twitter allows people to see a list of followers on different accounts.  In addition, Storify may provide basic statistics related to use of our Storify articles, where they were shared, when they were shared, etc. This information will only be used for the purposes of improving our use of Storify.</p>
<p>We may embed Storify articles created by our USGS accounts on USGS websites where related content is available, for example in a news release, publication, or other USGS page. </p>
<p>Lastly, visitors will have the option to follow a  USGS Storify page, which will enable notification when new stories are posted. Subscriptions are done via the Storify system and are publicly viewable as part of the Storify.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://storify.com/privacy">Storify Privacy page</a> for more information regarding how Storify handles privacy information.</p>
<p id="thunderclap"><strong>Thunderclap</strong> - The USGS uses a tool called Thunderclap. Thunderclap allows USGS to spread the word about events, special alerts, tips or other special messages throughout various social media platforms. You help by allowing us to send a message to your social media followers through Thunderclap. This spreading occurs only when a person opts-in to help spread that message. </p>
<p>How does Thunderclap work? When you sign up in Thunderclap, you let the Thunderclap system post our message to your Twitter, FB, or other accounts that you select. It's like a virtual flash mob - the messages will go out on everyone's walls and feeds at the same time. Note that you're only agreeing to each message at a time, not to all our future thunderclaps.
