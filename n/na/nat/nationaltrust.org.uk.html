	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>9. Links to third party websites</strong><br>
	<br>
	This privacy policy applies solely to the personal data collected by the National Trust and does not apply to third party websites and services that are not under our control.<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	We cannot be held responsible for the privacy policies of third party websites and we advise users to read the privacy policies of other websites before registering any personal data.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>10. Security</strong></p>
<p>
	We recognise the concerns that many people have about giving personal information online. These are the measures that we take to secure your information whilst using our web based services.<br>
	We use strong encryption both when your information is moving to or from our web services and also whilst your information is held by us.</p>
<p>
	Most “nationaltrust.org.uk” web pages are available in both the secure encrypted https format, as well as the standard http format. The secure version of the pages provides you with confidence that your communications are safe and carried out directly with an authentic National Trust website and web server.</p>
<p>
	We will shortly be moving to the secure version for all of our web pages to ensure all of your “nationaltrust.org.uk” activity is private and secure.</p>
<p>
	However, currently all “nationaltrust.org.uk” web pages that require you to enter personal information are already in the secure format. On any of our data entry pages you can check the security and authenticity by right clicking on the padlock icon in the address bar.</p>
<p>
	Our web servers use strong encryption and only store information for a temporary period. Once you have fully submitted your information, any temporary information is purged from our systems.<br>
	National Trust does not store any sensitive payment card data in our systems.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<strong>11. Payment card information</strong></p>
<p>
	The National Trust has an active PCI-DSS compliance programme in place. This is the international standard for safe card payment processes. As part of our compliance to this very stringent standard, we ensure that our IT systems do not directly collect or store your payment card information; for example the full 16 digit numbers on the front of the card or the security code on the back.</p>
<p>
	Our online payment solutions are carried out using a “payment gateway” which is a direct connection to a payment service provided by a bank. This means that when you input card data into the payment page, you are communicating directly with the bank and the bank passes your payment to us, this means that your payment card information is handled by the bank and not processed or held by us.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>12. Scannable cards</strong></p>
<p>
	We use barcodes on our membership cards to collect information on your visits. This data includes the properties you have visited, the date that you went and your membership number. We use this information to understand our supporters visiting trends.<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	We also use this information to make our communications to your more relevant to you.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<strong>13. What this page tells you and how it is updated</strong></p>
<p>
	This page will hold the latest information regarding our privacy and fair processing notification and we will refer to it when we ask you for your consent. This page will be updated from time to time to reflect the latest view of what we do with your data.<br>
