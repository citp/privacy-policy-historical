##### Vehicle Data

Our vehicles may be equipped with technology that collects and transmits data from your rental vehicle.

When installed and where permissible, this technology will enable us to collect and use information such as:

  * vehicle operation information, such as operational condition, mileage, tire pressure and fuel status, and other diagnostic and performance information.



Once collected, this information may be combined with information you have provided us and used to generate safety, performance, and other similar information so that we can deliver better services. Our use of the information may also include storage of this information after the expiration of your rental agreement.  Renting a vehicle does not prohibit us from obtaining and using data collected from the vehicle. Our use of the information may also include storage of this information after the expiration of the rental agreement. Your use of the Vehicle Data Systems made available to you is subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policy posted by the applicable Vehicle Data Systems provider and/or vehicle manufacturer (in the case of OnStar, information is available at [www.onstar.com](http://www.onstar.com/ "www.onstar.com")), which may include system and service limitations, warranty exclusions, limitations of liability, wireless service provider terms, privacy practices, descriptions of use and sharing of information and user responsibilities.

We are not responsible for any data that is left in the vehicle as a result of your use. We cannot guarantee the privacy or confidentiality of such information and you must remove any data before you return the vehicle to us.
