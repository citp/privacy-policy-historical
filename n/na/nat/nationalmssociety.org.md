When you visit our website, our Web server automatically logs (records) domain name and standard information about the operating system and Web browser you are using, as provided by your Web browser. To track your progress through the site, and to help us evaluate usage of the site, the server places a "cookie"—a small text file with an identification number—on your machine.

The information we collect is used to provide you with information about our programs and products available to you through the Society. We generally respond to you by postal service mail, email, or telephone—depending on your requests and our resources.

If you provide your postal address, telephone number, or email address to the National MS Society online, you may receive any of the following periodic contacts from us:

  * Mailings with information about multiple sclerosis and the Society’s programs and events;
  * Mailings to invite you to join the Society or to help the Society achieve its mission;

  * Email contact to alert you to multiple sclerosis news updates and programs, as well as invitations to join the Society or to help the Society achieve its mission.



From time to time, the National MS Society makes postal addresses available to other reputable organizations whose products, programs, or activities may be of interest to you. The Society carefully screens all organizations before allowing the use of our list. The list is never sold. 

If you do not want us to share your postal address with other organizations, please submit a statement to your local chapter via mail, or contact us via email at [mailinglist@nmss.org](mailto:mailinglist@nmss.org)
