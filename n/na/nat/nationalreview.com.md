# Privacy Policy - National Review Online

To help you understand how information submitted will be treated when you log on to and use our web site, National Review Online (www.nationalreview.com) offers this Privacy Policy. Use of the nationalreview.com web site, and disclosure to us of your personal information, is optional and voluntary. By visiting nationalreview.com, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Policy. The following paragraphs describe the type of information nationalreview.com collects, the reasons why such information is collected, how such information is used and who has access to it.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES   
Nationalreview.com’s Privacy Policy may change from time to time without notice to you. You should read this Privacy Policy each time you plan to submit personally identifiable information so that you understand how the information you are submitting will be used.

Any changes made to the Privacy Policy will be prospective, not retroactive.

Nationalreview.com is not responsible for the information practices of third parties, although we take care to engage third party fulfillment processors, ad servers, survey companies and other support services that respect your privacy, preferences and data security needs.

COLLECTION OF INFORMATION   
Nationalreview.com collects information that is provided voluntarily by visitors to our site. Certain identifying information, such as name, street address, city, state, zip code and email address, is gathered at certain interactive areas on the site, such as when you subscribe to our print or digital publication while online.

SUBSCRIPTIONS   
You may use the web site to subscribe to the print or digital version of _National Review_ by following the instructions for subscribing. All subscription-related information is collected from users on this site and stored by the magazine’s fulfillment house, Palm Coast Data.

SURVEYS   
From time to time nationalreview.com conducts voluntary user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers for various purposes including promotions, contests and offers. We never share any of this survey information about specific individuals with any third party.

COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES   
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. Nationalreview.com may use data contained in log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

We use advertising to help support our site. We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit [networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geo-targeting purposes or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited.

USE OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTED   
Nationalreview.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their interests. Because nationalreview.com does not track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked on a particular ad.

We also use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and do not like based on traffic to those areas.

CREDIT CARD INFORMATION  
We comply with generally accepted industry standards in collecting and processing credit card information. However, nationalreview.com does not guarantee the safety of credit card information over the Internet.

INFORMATION SHARING   
When you visit nationalreview.com and are asked to provide information about yourself, unless specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, you are sharing that information only with nationalreview.com. Nationalreview.com will not disclose the information you submit, except with our third party fulfillment vendors and except as otherwise described here, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure to protect the rights or property of nationalreview.com, or for administrative or other purposes we deem necessary to maintain or service our products and services. For example, we may allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide you with our services.

If you do not want your data to be shared, you may choose not to permit the data to be collected or transferred by not submitting personally identifiable information on our site, or by not using a particular service.

NATIONALREVIEW.COM SECURITY MEASURES   
Nationalreview.com web site has technical and organizational security measures in place, including firewalls, to protect the information under our control from accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures do not guarantee prevention of loss, misuse, or alteration of information, however, so while we strive to protect your information, nationalreview.com cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY   
Nationalreview.com is intended for use by individuals over the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not submit any personally identifiable information on our site. Children should always ask a parent or guardian for permission to send any personal information online to anyone.

OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY   
Whenever you voluntarily disclose any information online in any forum, that information can be collected and used by others. In other words, if you post personal information online that may be accessed by the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. It is important to be responsible and careful whenever you are online.
