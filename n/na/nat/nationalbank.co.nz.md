ANZ may at any time vary the ANZ Website Security and Privacy Statement. At least 14 days before we make any change we'll let you know what will change and the date it will take effect by publishing information about the change on the ANZ website.

### Security of information

ANZ takes reasonable steps to preserve the security of cookie and personal information in accordance with the ANZ Website Terms of Use and this ANZ Website Security and Privacy Statement. If your browser is suitably configured, it will advise you whether the information you are sending us will be secure (encrypted) or not secure (unencrypted). If secure transmission is indicated, ANZ currently uses 128 bit SSL encryption.

ANZ regularly reviews developments in security and encryption technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as totally secure. Accordingly, although ANZ strives to protect such information, ANZ cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable steps to preserve the security of the information in our own systems.

### Information collected

The information that ANZ collects about you is dependent on how you use the facilities offered by the ANZ website.

If you visit an unsecure area of the ANZ website (for example, an area where you are not required to log on) to read, browse or download information, our system will record the date and time of your visit to our site, the pages viewed and any information downloaded. If you are a customer and have previously accessed ANZ Internet Banking, then we can also use unique identifiers associated with your device to collect information about your activities on ANZ’s websites and third party websites that have ANZ content. We can combine that information with your personal information, in accordance with our ANZ Privacy Statement. If you are not a customer then this activity is collected anonymously.  
See the Cookies section below for more information.

The ANZ website offers a number of interactive facilities including tools such as budget planners and calculators, as well as online surveys and application forms.

By using an interactive facility on the ANZ website you agree that ANZ Group may collect and retain any personal information that you enter when using these interactive facilities, and that we can use that personal information to contact you about our products and services and for any other purpose set out in the ANZ Privacy Statement. You agree that this applies even if you save, suspend or cancel the interactive facility, without submitting your information to us.

Any personal information collected from the ANZ website will be treated in accordance with the ANZ Privacy Statement.

For example, the ANZ website contains a budget planner that allows you to suspend or save your plan and retrieve the details at a later time. In that case the information is stored on our systems and will not be automatically deleted. We can use any personal information you provide through that budget planner to contact you about our products and services. You may later recover the information you have entered when you resume your plan. 

We will not submit online application forms or online surveys without your consent.

ANZ uses Liveperson Inc. to deliver its live chat facility. If you decide to participate in a live chat, Liveperson Inc., on behalf of the ANZ Group, collects, stores, uses and discloses any personal information that you provide for quality assurance purposes and to allow ANZ to follow up with your inquiry. Liveperson Inc. is required under its arrangements with ANZ to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of that personal information.  

The ANZ website may also contain links to the websites of third party providers of goods and services ("Third Party websites"). If you have accessed Third Party websites through the ANZ website and if those third parties collect information about you, ANZ may also collect or have access to that information as part of our arrangements with those third parties. ANZ is not responsible for the content of Third Party websites.  Links are provided for convenience only and do not represent any endorsement by ANZ of products offered by the site owner.

Where you access a Third Party website from the ANZ website, cookie information, information about your preferences or other information you have provided about yourself may be shared between us and the third party.

If you are not a customer then this activity is collected anonymously.
