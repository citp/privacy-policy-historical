NBF.com has been able to grow and expand its product line with its direct marketing efforts. In order to reach customers who would benefit from our products we do rent other companies' customer lists and, in turn, we occasionally rent our customer list to carefully selected companies. Information shared in this process consists only of company, name and address. **NBF.com does not rent or sell email addresses or phone numbers.** Your email address and phone number will only be used for order confirmations, to communicate about your order and for the company's email newsletters. We appreciate your business and want to keep you as a valued customer of NBF.com.

We also provide your information to trustworthy organizations that assist in completing your order. These organizations include companies that validate and process credit card transactions, deliver your packages, schedule and perform product installations and manage service programs. It is possible that we may share your information with companies who help us analyze sales data, maintain our records, and provide other services for NBF.com . We may also disclose your information to companies that act on our behalf and at our guidance to inform you of other NBF.com products and services. These companies may conduct customer satisfaction surveys and manage additional customer services and benefits for us. These third parties are only authorized to use your information to execute their contractually assigned functions.
