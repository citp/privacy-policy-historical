We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors. Learning about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technologies they use, helps us improve the web site and the services we offer. In order to accomplish these goals, we are constantly conducting statistical analyses of the data we collect and are aggressively improving our hardware and software to meet your needs.

#### How voluntarily provided information is used 

If you voluntarily send us information, i.e. you fill out a form requesting information, it will be used for governmental purposes only. These purposes could include, without limitation:

  1. Helping us respond to your request for information
  2. To look into a problem you are bringing to our attention
  3. To keep lists of interested people (e.g. prospective vendors or employees)



We will not rent or sell information identifying you as a particular person (name, address, phone number, etc.) to third parties, without your express permission. We will also not disclose credit card information, except for purposes related to your credit card transaction, or with your permission, or as required by law under the State of Tennessee's Open Records Act.

#### Our policy on "cookies" 

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a session ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of this web site, like ebid.Nashville.gov, use cookies to track user sessions. We do this in order to determine if an individual has left the site and needs to log in again. The passive cookies used on this site do not remember you each time you visit the site.

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our web site, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of this web site if you do so. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use or navigate through many parts of our web site, except access to certain web pages that require a login and password.

For more detailed information on cookies, visit this page on the Microsoft web site.

#### Hosting of some parts of Nashville.gov by outside parties 

Some content on portions of this web site resides on servers run by non-nashville.gov parties. The non-nashville.gov parties have direct control of what information is automatically gathered, whether cookies are used, and how voluntarily provided information is used, and thus we cannot represent that they abide by this privacy policy. We are working toward integrating the entire web site on our servers so that we can guarantee our privacy statement across the site. Below are listed those Metro departments and associated agencies that are currently hosted by outside parties:

#### Use of Nashville.gov by Children

We do not specifically solicit information from minors or information that will enable us to determine if the user is a minor. Since we do not restrict users based on their ages, we would like to ask parents to assist their children when children are asked to provide personal information on line. We will also ask that children get their parents' permission before providing any information on line. Any information submitted by a minor, will be treated as information submitted by an adult, since we are not able to determine the user's actual age.

If you wish to use any of this content, you must obtain permission from the copyright holder before reproducing or otherwise using those graphics/images **.**
