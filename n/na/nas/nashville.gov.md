### Privacy Statement  


**What information is collected from you and why**

If all you do during your visit to nashville.gov is browse through our website, download information or read pages, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information will not identify you personally. The only information we automatically collect and store is the following information about your visit: the Internet domain (for example, "isp.com" if you use a private Internet service provider) and the IP address (the number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website; the type of browser and operating system you used to access our site; the date and time you accessed our site; the pages you visited; if you linked to our website from another website and the address of that website. We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors; learning about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use helps us improve the website and the services we offer. No other information about you is gathered or stored.

**How voluntarily provided information is used**

If you voluntarily send us information, i.e. you fill out a form requesting information, it will be used for governmental purposes only. These purposes could include, without limitation, helping us respond to your request for information; to look into a problem you are bringing to our attention; or to keep lists of interested people (e.g. prospective vendors or employees). We will not rent or sell information identifying you as a particular person (name, address, phone number, etc.) to third parties, without your express permission. We will also not disclose credit card information, except for purposes related to your credit card transaction, or with your permission, or as required by law under the State of Tennessee's Open Records Act.

**Our policy on "cookies"**

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a session ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of this website, like ebid.Nashville.gov, use cookies to track user sessions. We do this in order to determine if an individual has left the site and needs to log in again. The passive cookies used on this site do not remember you each time you visit the site.

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of this website if you do so. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use or navigate through many parts of our website, except access to certain web pages that require a login and password.
