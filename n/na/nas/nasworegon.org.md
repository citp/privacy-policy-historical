##### What Information does NASW gather/collect and how is it used?

**MEMBER INFORMATION:**  
NASW is a membership organization. In order to provide resources to members, and to differentiate between members, NASW collects member information including mail and email address, phone number, birthdate, username, demographic and professional information, and certain member preferences. 

Your mail and email address will be used to send you information relating to your NASW membership, based on the preferences you provide. See NASW communications and Opt-Out sections below for more information. 

**SESSION RECORDS:**  
We collect user session connection information as a means to provide additional security to members. Collecting session information allows us the ability to automatically log out a user who may have forgotten to log out after pre-determined time of inactivity. 

To maintain our quality of service, we may also gather additional data on connection information, including the timing and size of all packets sent over the Internet during a session. The gathered information is not correlated with personally identifiable data about individuals and is used only to ensure the highest quality experience possible at www.socialworkers.org. 

**SURVEYS:**  
In addition to required member information, we may conduct surveys and ask users to volunteer demographic information to be used on an aggregate basis for internal member research. We use such information to better focus and personalize our service offered to each individual user. 

**COOKIES:**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.

We use cookies (small text files placed on your device) and similar technologies to provide our services and help collect data. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once per session, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies also allow us, among other things, to provide interest-based advertising; and analyze how our services are performing. We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data about our products and services. Our services may include web beacons and cookies from third-party service providers. You have a variety of tools to control cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, including browser controls to block and delete cookies and controls from some third-party analytics service providers to opt out of data collection through web beacons. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. However, they will be limited in the use of certain areas of the website - like areas that require user logon. Your browser and other choices may impact your experiences with our services. 

**TRAFFIC PATTERNS/LOG FILES:**  
We also collect aggregate traffic statistics throughout our site to show the number of visitors to our site, the requests we receive from our website, and the ISPs that those requests came from. These statistics are used by internal NASW staff to improve our website and provide better services to members. 

##### With whom does NASW share my member information?

The National Office does not release information about a member other than to confirm her/ his status as a member of the Association in response to general public requests. In the context of approved Association business such as identification of members for leadership positions or public affairs or for established business partners such as the NASW Assurance Services, Inc. and Infocus Marketing, or affinity partners such as Commerce Bank, specific identifying information is provided in order to permit contact. 

NASW partners with a vendor, InFocus Marketing, to manage mailing list requests. The National Office reviews each request from a third party organization or individual who seeks to promote to NASW members any professional materials, training products or services related to the field of Social Work, or to perform research specific to the profession of Social Work. If approved, NASW make membership postal addresses available for one-time use rental by the screened and vetted third party. Email addresses are not released to any third party; instead, an approved email message may be sent to members by NASW’s contracted service provider who acts on behalf of NASW. Members may have their name excluded from rental lists by updating their Communications Preferences in the NASW Member Center at [www.socialworkers.org](mailto:membership@naswdc.org), or or by contacting Member Services at 800-742-4089 or[membership@naswdc.org](mailto:membership@naswdc.org). 

NASW is not able to control the practices of external websites and organizations to which we may provide links. If you have questions about how such organizations use the information gathered when you link to their sites please read their privacy policies. 

##### How does NASW secure member information?

NASW and socialworkers.org take reasonable precautions to protect our users’ information. When our registration form asks members to enter member information (such as member id, username and password), that information is protected by encryption before being sent to us. Also, the member information you provide is stored in a secure location, and is accessible only by appropriate staff. 

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to membership@naswdc.org 

##### How can I review, update and correct my member information?

Members can reset their username or password using the Password Reset tool on the Log-In page. Additionally, members can update all contact information; professional, education and demographic information; and communications preferences in the NASW Member Center at www.socialworkers.org, or by contacting NASW Member Services at (800) 742-4089 or membership@naswdc.org.

##### What communication can I expect from NASW based on collected information?

**Resources, Benefits, Special Offers and Updates**  
Members will occasionally receive information on member benefits, programs, products and services. 

**Renewal**  
Members may be sent a courtesy email notifying them of an impending membership renewal/expiration date. Generally, members may not opt-out of these communications, which relate to the status of their account and are not promotional in nature.
