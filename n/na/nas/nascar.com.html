	<p>Thank you for visiting NASCAR.com. Turner Sports Interactive, Inc. ("TSI") operates NASCAR.com pursuant to agreements with the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc. and NASCAR Digital Entertainment, Ltd. (collectively, "NASCAR"). Your privacy is important to TSI and NASCAR ("we", "us" or "our"). To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at NASCAR.com. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Notice apply only to information gathered through and in connection with this web site and do not necessarily reflect our practices for other sites we operate, including the NASCAR.com Store. Please see the  <a href="http://store.nascar.com/helpdesk/index.jsp?display=safety&amp;subdisplay=privacy">NASCAR.COM Store's Privacy Notice</a>.</p>
	<p class="pageSubHeader1">The Information We Collect</p>
	<p>At our site, you may now or in the future be able to order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.</p>
	<p>You may also be able to submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.</p>
	<p>At certain parts of our site, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.</p>
	<p>We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>
	<p class="pageSubHeader1">How We Use the Information</p>
	<p>We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, advertisements, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. </p>
	<p>We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.</p>
	<p>We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or cards. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them. </p>
	<p>The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services. </p>
	<p>If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., questions for an online chat guest), we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us (e.g. transcript of the chat, including your question). </p>
	<p>We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. </p>
	<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.

In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company.</p>

	<p class="pageSubHeader1">What is the NAI? </p>
	<p>The NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) is a cooperative group of <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/aboutnai_members.asp" target="_blank">network advertisers</a>. We have developed a set of <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/aboutnai_principles.asp" target="_blank">privacy principles</a>, in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission. The NAI's foremost commitment is to provide consumers with clear explanations of Internet advertising practices and how they affect you and the Internet itself.</p>
	<p class="pageSubHeader1">Opt-Out</p>
	<p>Most content on the Internet-- from the latest political news to up-to-the-minute sports scores and stock quotes-- is free to consumers. Why? Because of effective Internet advertising. The NAI knows, however, that users are concerned about their online privacy. So, our member companies have banded together to give you the choice to "<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/wrong_browser.asp" target="_blank">opt-out</a>" of targeted advertising delivered by each and every NAI ad network.</p>
