	<p>At our site, you may now or in the future be able to order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.</p>

The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.</p>
	<p>At certain parts of our site, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.</p>
	<p>We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>
	<p class="pageSubHeader1">How We Use the Information</p>
	<p>We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, advertisements, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. </p>

	<p class="pageSubHeader1">What is the NAI? </p>
	<p>The NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) is a cooperative group of <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/aboutnai_members.asp" target="_blank">network advertisers</a>. We have developed a set of <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/aboutnai_principles.asp" target="_blank">privacy principles</a>, in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission. The NAI's foremost commitment is to provide consumers with clear explanations of Internet advertising practices and how they affect you and the Internet itself.</p>
	<p class="pageSubHeader1">Opt-Out</p>
	<p>Most content on the Internet-- from the latest political news to up-to-the-minute sports scores and stock quotes-- is free to consumers. Why? Because of effective Internet advertising. The NAI knows, however, that users are concerned about their online privacy. So, our member companies have banded together to give you the choice to "<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/wrong_browser.asp" target="_blank">opt-out</a>" of targeted advertising delivered by each and every NAI ad network.</p>
