<p class="content"><b>Public Disclosure </b></p>
<span class="content">Nassau County strives to protect personally identifiable information by collecting only information necessary to deliver our services. All information that may be collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists.

<p class="content"><b>Cookies </b></p>
<p class="content"><b>What Is a Cookie? </b></p>
<span class="content">A cookie is a small data file which may include an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and may either be used only during your session (a "session" cookie) or may be stored on your computer's hard drive (a "persistent" cookie). Cookies can contain data about user movement during the visit to the website. If your browser software is set to allow cookies, a website can send its own cookie to you. The County’s website may send cookies that will be placed on your machine.<br>
<br>
<b>Why Are Cookies Used on Websites?</b> <br>
<br>
Cookies are a mechanism for maintaining continuity during a user's visit to a website. They allow data to be maintained for users' benefit as they navigate a site. This is referred to as "session" or "management" cookie. These cookies go away when you terminate your visit to the website as they are maintained only in your browser's active memory during your session. <br>
<br>
Cookies may also be stored on your computer so that you can be recognized by a website on subsequent visits. They are read by the website that set them whenever you re-visit the website. They are often used on websites that require you to login so that you can avoid having to enter all of your login information every visit. They may store information on your unique identifier and the areas of the website you have visited before. These cookies are stored on your computer's hard drive after you have left your website visit and consequently are often referred to as "persistent" cookies. </span>
<p class="content"><b>User Choices Regarding Cookies </b></p>
<span class="content">You may be able to configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) <br>
</span>
<p class="content"><b>Security </b></p>
<span class="content">Nassau County has taken several steps to safeguard the integrity of its telecommunications and computing infrastructure. Security measures have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day practices of the entire operating environment as part of its continuing commitment to risk management. The County, however, does not guarantee the absolute security of information it maintains. <br>
</span>
<p class="content"><b>Disclaimer </b></p>
<span class="content">This website may contain hypertext links to external websites and pages containing information created and maintained by public and private organizations other than Nassau County. These may include links to websites operated by other government agencies or by nonprofit organizations. When you link to another site, you are no longer on the Nassau County website and this Privacy Policy will not apply. When you link to another website, you are subject to the privacy policy of that site. The County’s website is designed to provide businesses, visitors and residents access to County government departments, services and programs. Secondarily, the website also provides businesses, residents and visitors links to pertinent visitor-related information about the area. From time to time, departments may wish to provide links to other sites that provide local, state or federal government information, additional information about the community, including festivals, cultural events and local news, or other information supporting the department’s mission and programs.<br>
