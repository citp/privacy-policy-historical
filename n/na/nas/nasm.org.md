Any such unsecured transmission is at your own risk. We recommend that you use appropriate security measures to protect your information.

**Correction of Your Personal Information**  
Accuracy is a top priority for us. You can ensure that any contact data is up-to-date and can correct, update or delete inaccuracies to the information by either logging into your account to review and maintain your information or by contacting customer service. In certain situations, you may need assistance from customer service in making a change. For example, if you received a certification and then realized that your name was misspelled, we may need to take certain steps to verify your identity before making the change, ensure that your name change is linked to all of your certification records and, in some states or countries, that the oversight agency receives the correction. We will respond to your request to make changes to your records as soon as reasonably possible.

We will attempt to answer all requests that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete it as long as we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. 

In addition, to protect your privacy, we may require you to prove your identity before granting access to, or agreeing to update, correct or delete your personal information.

Not all information about you can be changed. For example, we may have records about how much time you spent working in a training module. Although this information is linked to you, it may not be changed and, in certain instances, it may be subject to government or regulatory oversight. Similarly, learning data, assessment scores and certification status kept in NASM/AFAA systems may not be changed by you, although you should contact us if you believe such data is not accurate.

If you consider our Processing of your Personal Data to be inconsistent with the applicable data protection laws, you may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory [Data Protection Authority](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm) responsible for data protection matters.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

If you are a resident of a European country participating in the Privacy Shield and you have not received timely response to your concern, or we have not addressed your concern to your satisfaction, you may seek further assistance, at no cost to you, from [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/), which is an independent dispute resolution body in the United States.  For information about JAMS, please see  <https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield>. 

We also will cooperate with competent EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to human resources data transferred from a European country participating in the Privacy Shield in the context of the employment relationship.

You may also be able to invoke binding arbitration for unresolved complaints but prior to initiating such arbitration, a resident of a European country participating in the Privacy Shield must first: (1) contact us and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance from [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/); and (3) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue. If such a resident invokes binding arbitration, each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the resident.
