We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to help identify individual web site usage. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. NASDAQ, Inc. uses cookies on some of our websites.

### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs/ Embedded Pixels)

In an effort to provide users with the most relevant Web site content, we may also use embedded pixel technologies to help track site usage, these technologies are used on selected pages for the purposes of identifying unique user visits as opposed to aggregate hits.

This information is used to evaluate site content, navigability and composition as well as page response rates. Any data linking the information gathered by clear gifs to a user's personally identifiable information is used for internal tracking purposes only. We will not disclose or divulge such data linkages outside of NASDAQ, Inc..
