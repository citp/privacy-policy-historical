# Naseeb.com Privacy Policy - Naseeb.com

This privacy policy describes how we collect and use your data. If you have any questions or comments regarding Naseeb Networks' privacy policy or its enforcement, please contact us at [privacy@naseebnetworks.com](mailto:privacy@naseebnetworks.com)

  
**1\. ABOUT NASEEB NETWORKS.**  
Naseeb.com is an online social networking community that connects people through their personal networks and allows them to meet others, buy and sell services, and perform other transactions. Members create their own profiles, and those profiles are then shown to their immediate circle of friends.

**2\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT.**   
Naseeb Networks, Inc. collects information our users submit to us such as their name and e-mail address to allow us to identify users and notify them of changes or updates to our service. We also collect personal information submitted by our users in filling out their profile on the service such as gender, city and country of residence, occupation, interests, etc. We collect this personal information when our users: 

  1. sign up as a member; 
  2. make changes to their member profile information; and 
  3. send e-mail messages, forms, or other information to us via Naseeb.com. Members may choose to provide additional information beyond their basic profile. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables our users to better identify each other and more effectively connect and interact with their network.



Naseeb.com also collects information from users that is unique, but cannot be linked to a specific individual, such as IP address and browser type. A user's session will be tracked, but each user will remain anonymous. We gather this information on all visitors to [www.naseeb.com](http://www.naseeb.com/) for systems administration purposes and to track user trends, such as our most popular features. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information.

**3\. COOKIES.**

The Basic Profile information (first name, age, gender, location, marital status, and religion) is displayed to either all members of Naseeb.com or to members of their trusted circle of friends (up to 4 degrees of separation)  
as selected by the user. This applies as well to all other profile information (except photos) optionally provided by members.

Member photos placed on the site are visible to either all members of the site, members of the immediate circle of friends, or to just members selected by the user.

Email addresses are displayed only when a user invites a friend via email to join the service, when a user requests to add another user to their friend list, and when we send notifications to a user related to their use of the service. Email addresses of Naseeb.com members are never displayed to other users on the system. Users on Naseeb.com with each other through the Naseeb.com service without disclosing their email addresses.
