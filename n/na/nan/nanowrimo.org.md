# National Novel Writing Month

National Novel Writing Month collects personal information from the users of this site.

We require, at minimum, that users choose a username and provide us with a valid, working email address when they register for this site.

Users may, if they wish, provide a variety of other personal data, including contact information, location, interests, personal preferences, past participation in NaNoWriMo, and novel excerpts.

We also keep track of users who have donated to NaNoWriMo and users who have won NaNoWriMo.

All of this information, with the exception of email address, are made available to the public in the Author section of this website.

Users have the option, via a setting in their account profile, of allowing NaNoWriMo to contact them via email.

Users who affiliate with a NaNoWriMo region will receive emails from the volunteers who run those regions.

NaNoWriMo does not share ANY user information with ANY third parties EVER.
