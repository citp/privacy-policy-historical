What is our Cookies Policy?

5.1  We, our third party service providers and our partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience at our Website and across the Internet. "Cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as product preferences, to tell us which site pages you have visited and in what order. We use cookies and other technical information to personalize your visit to the Website, to analyze traffic on the Website and to track user trends, patterns and selections for authorized download and for technical reasons connected with your use of our site. Cookies can either be permanent (i.e. they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e. they last only until you close your browser).

5.2   We utilize Google Analytics to analyze usage patterns of the Site.  Google Analytics generates a cookie to capture information about your use of the Site which Google uses to compile reports on website activity for us and to provide other related services.  Google may use a portion of your IP address to identify their cookie, but this will not be associated with any other data held by Google. From time to time we may implement additional features including  Remarketing with Google Analytics to place ads on other sites you may visit after visiting our site,  Google Display Network Impression Reporting to report how people’s interactions with our ads relate to their visits to our site, DoubleClick Platform integrations to help optimize our online advertising efforts, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to analyze information about our site visitors’ interests.  These tools help us to better understand your interests and how to provide you with more relevant online advertising. We and third party vendors, including Google, may use first and third party cookies together to optimize and serve ads tailored to you based, for example, on what parts of our site you viewed.

Additionally, by setting your web browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some web beacons. To the extent that your browser permits such ‘do-not-track’ settings, we will recognize that setting and exclude you from analytics that collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites.
