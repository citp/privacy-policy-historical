# Privacy Policy | Nanigans – Advertising Automation Software

**Privacy Policy**

Effective Date:  April 17, 2015

#### Introduction

At Nanigans, Inc. (“Nanigans”, “the Company”, “us”), we take privacy issues seriously.  The following is an outline of the ways in which we collect and use the personal information you provide on our web site www.nanigans.com and through the Nanigans Ad Automation Software (our “Services”).  It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

Nanigans has received TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe certification covers only our collection, use and disclosure of information we collect through our website www.nanigans.com and our Ad Automation Software. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the customer has engaged Nanigans.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe [here](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request).

#### Information Collection and Use

Nanigans does not collect or use personally identifiable information, with the exception of customer account information that is voluntarily submitted to the Company.  We collect data that comes directly from our advertising partners and relates to events and business metrics.  Our advertising partners provide us non-personal, statistical reports regarding the effectiveness of an ad.  These reports do not contain any personal information about those who interacted with the ad.  The information that we do receive is generated from ‘clicks’ and/or impressions on our ads and enables us to best provide our customers with effective targeting and feedback.

User accounts with Nanigans are only available to advertisers.  For these accounts, we hold user submitted information such as username and password in order to authenticate users and to contact users with relevant information having to do with their Nanigans accounts.

If you visit our website or receive our email newsletter, we may collect your contact information such as name, email address, mailing address, and phone number.  This information that we hold is not shared with anyone.  We may use this information for internal purposes to send you a requested product, respond to your service requests, questions or concerns, administer your account, send you newsletters or catalogues, and/or to improve our web site and marketing efforts.

#### Information Sharing

We will only share your personal information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

##### Legal Disclaimer

We may also disclose your personal information:

  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
  * if Nanigans is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or use of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information, to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.



#### Analytics/Log Files

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), search terms, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

#### Tracking Technologies/Cookies

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Nanigans. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

Cookies are small files that are placed on your browser or device by the website or app you are using or ad you have viewed. Like most websites, we use cookies to provide you with a better, faster or safer experience.  Cookies and pixels are used to understand and deliver advertisements and make them more relevant to you.  For example, Facebook may read a cookie that tells them you’re logged into Facebook so that they can show you ads that may be interesting to you on Facebook or other websites. Cookies are used to learn whether someone who saw an ad on Facebook later visited and purchased goods from the advertiser’s site. Within our own campaigns, Nanigans may use a cookie to determine whether we’ve shown an ad and how it performed. Facebook may also work with a partner to show you an ad on Facebook after you’ve visited the partner’s site and this may involve the use of cookies.

Cookies are used to understand, improve, and research products and services. For example, cookies may be used to understand how you are using social plugins in order to improve them. Facebook may also use a cookie to understand the ads served by them and their partners.

The cookies within the advertisements that we run report non-personal data to log files which we in turn analyze in order to best provide our customers with feedback.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  A session ID cookie is used to identify a particular visit to the Nanigans website. Session cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  A persistent cookie is set once you’ve logged in to your Nanigans account. The next time you visit the Nanigans website using the same device, the persistent cookie will enable us to recognize you as an existing user, so you may not need to log in before using our services.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited.

##### Web Beacons / Gifs

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

##### 3rd Party Tracking

The use of cookies and clear gifs by our technology partners and service providers is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  Our technology partners and service providers use trackers to optimize your experience on our site and help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personally identifiable information.

##### Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting

As part of our Services that we provide to our customers, we partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if located in the European Union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/))  Please note this does not opt you out of being served all ads.  You will continue to receive generic ads.

##### Web Opt-Out (Nanigans.com)

If you choose not to receive the benefits of cookies, you may ‘opt-out‘ by clicking the following link: [Opt-Out](http://www.nanigans.com/opted-out/)

Please be aware that because cookies are browser specific, if you use more than one browser on your computer, you will need to repeat the opt-out process on the other browser(s) in order to opt-out completely. Please note that you will need to opt out of the Nanigans’ cookie again if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change the browser on your existing computer, or delete the Nanigans opt-out cookie.  If you wish to opt back in, you may do so by deleting the Nanigans opt-out cookie from your browser.

#### Information Related to Data Collected through Nanigans Ad Automation Software

Nanigans collects information through its Services under the direction of its customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it may process.

##### Access and Choice

3rd parties who seek access, or who seek to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data that is collected through Nanigans’ Services or who would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our service, should contact the customer or other business entity that such 3rd party interacts with directly (the data controller). If any of our customers request Nanigans remove data that the customer controls upon demand of a 3rd party, we will respond to their request within 30 days.

#### User Access and Choice

We will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

We take the security of information that we collect very seriously and therefore implement measures in order to protect it.  When you log into our Ad Automation Software, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
