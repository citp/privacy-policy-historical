		<h2 class="head-page">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Because  we gather information about where you go on the  National Association of Attorneys General's (NAAG)  network of websites and services, we want you  to fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding  the capture and use of that information. This  privacy statement discloses what information we  gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change  it.  </p>

<p>NAAG  collects two types of information about users:  data that users provide through optional, voluntary  registration for newsletters and other services  and aggregated tracking information derived by  tallying page views throughout the site. NAAG  will not share the information that it gathers  about any user, except for some educational contests  and legislative activities and then only with  the user's express consent, with anyone. The only  exception to this general rule is if NAAG must  divulge information to comply with state and federal  laws and court orders.  </p>

<p>This  privacy policy includes a description of the following:  </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>the  information NAAG gathers about you;<br>
	</li><li>what NAAG does with the information it  gathers about you;<br>
	</li><li>with whom NAAG shares the information  it gathers;<br>
	</li><li>NAAG's opt-in policy;<br>
	</li><li>NAAG's policy on correcting and updating  personally identifiable information; and<br>
	</li><li>NAAG's policy on deleting or deactivating  your name from the site's database.<br>
</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Questions  regarding this statement should be directed to  NAAG at <a href="mailto:privacy@naag.org">privacy@naag.org</a>.  </p>

<p><b>1.  Information gathered and tracked by NAAG</b></p>

<p>NAAG  gathers two types of information about users:  (1) data that users provide through optional,  voluntary registration for newsletters and other  services and for certain public educational activities  and (2) aggregated tracking information derived  mainly by tallying page views throughout the site  and click-through on our newsletters. Such information  enables us to better tailor our content to readers'  needs. </p>

<p>NAAG  will divulge information about a user to a third-party  ONLY with the user's permission and only to complete  transactions, e.g., purchases, seminar registrations,  and educational contests, initiated by the user  (the information to be shared and the parties  with whom the information will be shared will  be clearly indicated). The only exception to this  general rule is if NAAG must divulge information  to comply with state and federal laws and court  orders. </p>

<p>NAAG  gathers user information in the following processes:  </p>

<p><b>Optional  Registration:</b> Several NAAG sites offer free,  voluntary registration to users. By registering,  users can enter the sites without having to log  on each time; they gain access to surveys and  polls; and they can take advantage of personalization  (i.e., the ability to select content according  to a user-supplied profile). </p>

<p>During  registration the user is encouraged to supply  a user name, password, and email address and,  in some circumstances, has the option to answer  other survey questions. In addition, the user  can opt to subscribe to various NAAG electronic  newsletters and to have his or her email address  and/or URL appear in postings. </p>

<p><b>Required  Registrations:</b> For password protected sections,  you will be required to provide a user ID and  password. To ensure security of the protected  sections and the quality of our service you will  be required to complete a profile. This ID is  encrypted using either authentication from the  operating system or by secure socket layer protection.  </p>

<p><b>Polling  and Surveys:</b> Several NAAG sites may offer  interactive polls to users so they can easily  share their opinions with other users and see  what the audience thinks about important issues.  NAAG uses cookies (see section on cookies below)  to "tag" users after they have voted, so they  can vote only once on a particular question. This  tag is not correlated with information about individual  users. </p>

<p>Some  surveys inside the member's only section are used  to create detailed demographic information presented  in our printed and on-line reports. </p>

<p><b>Message  boards/forums:</b> Users of the NAAG message boards  and discussion forums must register separately  for these services (both are free of charge) to  post messages, although they need not register  to visit the site. During registration the user  is required to supply a username, password, and  email address. </p>

<p><b>Electronic  newsletters:</b> Some NAAG practice areas offer  a free electronic newsletter to users. NAAG gathers  the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe.  Users may remove themselves from this mailing  list through the subscription management pages.  Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at  the time of registration. </p>

<p>NAAG  delivers newsletters and other information by  e-mail only registered recipients from our subscription  center. The management system recognizes the URL  that was clicked, and records some information  about your computer, such as the browser, operating  system, and IP address. </p>

<p>NAAG  also uses the feature of your browser to set a  "cookie" on your system. This allows us to measure  and report the click through rate on emails delivered  and better determine future content. No personally  identifiable information is placed in the cookie.</p>

<p>NAAG's  "Send this story to a friend" service: A reader  can choose to electronically forward a news story  to someone else by clicking the link at the top  of that story. The user must provide their e-mail  address, as well as that of the recipient. This  information is used only in the case of transmission  errors and, of course, to let the recipient know  who sent the story. The information is not used  for any other purpose. </p>

<p><b>Surveys:</b>  Occasionally NAAG conducts user surveys to better  target our content to our audience. For public  surveys we sometimes share the aggregated demographic  information in these surveys. We never share any  of this information about specific individuals  with any third party. </p>

<p><b>Educational  Activities:</b> NAAG may offer from time-to-time  educational activities in which we request certain  personal information. At a minimum, the required  information includes name and email address; in  some cases, the user must answer mandatory survey  questions about a range of other data. The information  gathered in the activity form is used to verify  the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an  email notification that their entry has been received,  and to contact you if follow-up is requested or  necessary. There are two situations in which NAAG  will divulge this information to a third-party–provided  the user gives express consent: </p>
<blockquote>

<p>•A  user may expressly choose to receive additional  information from a educational activity partner,  in which case the user's personally identifiable  information is divulged to the partner;</p>

<p>•Some  of the activities may be hosted on the NAAG  site but administered by a partner; in such  cases, the information a user provides is passed  on to the third party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

</p><p>Because  the rules and terms of each educational activity  can vary, information about each activity is clearly  posted during the event.</p>

<p><b>Usage  tracking:</b> NAAG tracks user traffic patterns  throughout all of our sites. This allows NAAG  to improve sites on the network by determining  ease of use and successful services. Usually we  will collect browser type, IP address, and operating  system but in certain circumstances may need to  collect other data. No personally identifiable  information is placed in the cookie.</p>

<p><b>Cookies:</b>  A cookie is a small data file that certain Web  sites write to your hard drive when you visit  them. A cookie file can contain information such  as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages  you've visited. But the only personal information  a cookie can contain is information you supply  yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard  disk or read cookie files created by other sites.  NAAG uses cookies to track user traffic patterns  (as described above), to personalize your experience,  to register you for a seminar, and to purchase  subscriptions and other publications. </p>

<p>When  you register, NAAG uses a cookie to store a unique,  random user ID. We do not store passwords or any  personal information about you. We use this ID  to identify you anonymously in our database and  to track the pages you visit on our site. Cookies  also enable you to enter certain NAAG sites without  having to log on each time. The user ID is encrypted  in the database for added security. </p>

<p>The  "Entrance to Members Only" uses a cookie to verify  NAAG members through an ID. We use this ID to  identify you anonymously in our database and to  track the pages you visit on our site. Cookies  also enable you to enter certain NAAG sites without  having to log on each time. </p>

<p>If  you've set your browser to warn you before accepting  cookies, you will receive the warning message  with each cookie. </p>

<p>You  can refuse cookies by turning them off in your  browser. You do not need to have cookies turned  on to use any NAAG site. However, you do need  cookies to participate actively in NAAG's message  boards and purchase publications in NAAG's e-commerce  store. </p>

<p><b>2.	 Use of the information by NAAG</b></p>



<p>NAAG  uses any information voluntarily given by our  users to enhance their experience in our network  of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized  elements on the sites or to better prepare future  content based on the interests of our users. </p>

<p>As  stated above, NAAG uses information that users  voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic  newsletters. NAAG never shares newsletter mailing  lists with any third parties, including partners.  We use tracking information to determine which  areas of our sites users like and don't like based  on traffic to those areas. NAAG does not track  what individual users read, but rather how well  each page performs overall. This helps us continue  to build a better service for you. </p>

<p><b>3.	 Sharing of the information</b></p>



<p>NAAG  uses the above-described information to tailor  our content to suit your needs. We do not share  information about individual users with any third-party,  except in the case of some educational activities  and legislative efforts as noted above and then  only with a user's express consent. (NAAG will  also divulge information to comply with state  and federal laws and court orders.) </p>

<p><b>4.	 Opt-in policy</b></p>



<p>NAAG  will follow an "opt-in" policy. In other words,  you will need to sign up to receive newsletters  and other information from the NAAG website. Some  examples of this policy include: </p>
<blockquote>  <div class="press">
	<li>  Opting to receive our electronic newsletters  when registering for a site;<br>
	</li><li> Opting to provide certain personal information  when registering for a site or when participating  in an educational activity (see above); and<br>
	</li><li> Opting to participate in certain interactive  areas, which completely alleviates the need  to gather any personally identifiable information  from our users <br>

</li></div></blockquote>

<p><b>5.  Correct/update policy</b></p>

<p>Users  may correct or change the information collected  during registration for any site (see above).  The instructions for doing this can be found in  our personalization area. Users may change this  information at any time and as often as necessary.  Users who are experiencing problems or who have  any questions about how our services work can  contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@naag.org">support@naag.org</a>.  </p>

<p> <b>6.	 Delete/deactivate policy</b></p>

<p>Users  may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters  at any time by following the instructions contained  at the end of every newsletter. </p>
<p>Currently,
NAAG does not offer users a means by which to
completely delete personal information established
at the time of registration for any site. </p>
