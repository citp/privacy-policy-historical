Additionally, we may disclose and maintain user information in special cases, including:

  * In the event that some or all of our business assets are sold or transferred, we would transfer your information to the buyer or transferee where the above policies would apply;
  * Where we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure of such information in response to legal process and law enforcement rights, and as necessary to protect the property, interests and rights of Naartjie, its affiliates, and others.
