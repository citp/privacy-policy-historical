This Privacy Policy addresses the type of personally identifiable information the NAAG collects, how the NAAG uses that information and how the NAAG protects it.

The NAAG collects personal information about individuals who choose to provide it to the NAAG to register for a conference, subscribe to a newsletter or order a publication. This information typically includes the user’s name, title, name of company or organization, business address, business phone and email address.

Users’ personal data is stored by the NAAG on its servers, and on the servers of the cloud-based data management services the NAAG engages, located in the United States.
