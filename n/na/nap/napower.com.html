      <span id="awshort"><strong>Your purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs) is supporting electricity production in the United States. You will continue to receive a separate electricity bill from your utility (if applicable). For every unit of renewable electricity generated, an equivalent amount of RECs is produced. The purchase of RECs helps offset conventional electricity generation in the region where the renewable electricity generator is located. The purchase also helps build a market for renewable electricity and may have other local and global environmental benefits such as reducing global climate change and regional air pollution. For more information about RECs, please visit <a href="http://www.green-e.org" target="blank">www.green-e.org</a>.</strong>&nbsp;For Full disclaimer <a href="#" id="newdisclaimer">click here.</a>

<span id="showAWDisclaimer"><strong>When a renewable energy facility operates, it creates electricity that is delivered into a vast network of transmission wires, often referred to as "the grid." The grid is segmented into regional power pools; in many cases these pools are not interconnected. To help facilitate the sale of renewable electricity nationally, a system was established that separates renewable electricity generation into two parts: the electricity or electrical energy produced by a renewable generator and the renewable "attributes" of that generation. The renewable attributes or "green" attributes are sold separately as renewable energy certificates (RECs). Only one certificate may be issued for each unit of renewable electricity produced. The electricity that was split from the REC is no longer considered "renewable" and cannot be counted as renewable or zero-emissions by whoever buys it.
 
This product is comprised of RECs. With the purchase of RECs, you are buying the renewable attributes (i.e. environmental benefits) of a specific amount and type of renewable energy generation. You will continue to receive a separate electricity bill from your utility (if applicable). Your purchase of renewable certificates helps offset conventional electricity generation in the region where the renewable generator is located. Your purchase also helps build a market for renewable electricity and may have other local and global environmental benefits such as reduced global climate change and regional air pollution.
 
The renewable certificates in this product are verified and certified by Green-e Energy. Each supplier of renewable certificates is required to disclose the quantity, type and geographic source of each certificate. Please see the Product Content Label for this information. Green-e Energy also verifies that the renewable certificates are not sold more than once or claimed by more than one party. For information on Green-e Energy please visit its Web site, www.green-e.org, or call them toll-free, 1-888-63-GREEN.</strong>&nbsp;For Short disclaimer <a href="#" id="shortdisclaimer">click here.</a></span>
