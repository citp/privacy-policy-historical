### Information Automatically Collected

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes, without limitation, Internet Protocol addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.

Our websites may use other technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, or other forms of local storage, including HTML5 local storage in order to collect and track information about visitors to our websites.

Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.

This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.

We may use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you regarding products, services and events that may be of interest to you, for other promotional purposes and for other purposes described herein.

### Google Analytics

We use a web analytics tool called "Google Analytics" to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We have implemented the Demographics Reporting feature that allows us to use cookies to collect information such as the gender of the individual visiting our site and the age of the individual visiting our site. We use the information we receive from Google Analytics to improve the site and other data uses stated herein. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. [Google Analytics' Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and [Google's Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) restrict Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site.

We may share Personal and Payment Information with our affiliates as well as with applicable utilities and our service providers to assist us with any of the purposes set forth above (which, for example, might include disclosures to attorneys, accountants, auditors, credit bureaus, data processors, payment processors, and technical systems consultants) to the extent necessary or appropriate for them to perform their services to us. To that end, we may report information about your account(s) to credit bureaus and/or consumer reporting agencies.

Please note that we will release your Personal or Payment Information if required to do so by law, search warrant, subpoena, court order or other legal process.

We may also disclose your Personal or Payment Information if you or your legal representative authorizes us to do so, or if it is necessary to perform credit checks or collect or report debts owed to us.

NA Power reserves the right to transfer any Personal or Payment Information in the event we transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, such as bankruptcy, dissolution, merger or acquisition. If such a transfer should occur, the privacy policy of another company may supplant our Policy. However, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use Personal or Payment Information in a manner that is consistent with our Policy.

### How We Safeguard Your Personal Information

The security of your personal information is very important to us. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect, including, without limitation, any Social Security numbers we may receive. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring, receiving and displaying Personal and Payment Information on our website. Only those employees and service providers who need access to your Social Security number in order to perform their duties are authorized to have access to such information. However, we cannot guarantee that all communications between us or information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers, and your use of our website, products and services demonstrates your assumption of this risk.

Certain states where we operate have specific requirements regarding the disclosure and protection of certain customer personal information; for example, we comply with Connecticut's (C.G.S. 42-470 et. seq.) and Massachusetts' (201 CMR 17.00; M.G.L. c. 93H) applicable rules.

### Your California Privacy Rights

The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to those websites. We suggest contacting those websites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection, and distribution policies.

### Changes to this Policy

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify our privacy practices and update and make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. For this reason, we encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis. This Privacy Policy is current as of the "Last Revised" date, which appears at the top of this page.
