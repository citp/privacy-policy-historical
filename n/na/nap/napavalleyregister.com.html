<h1>Privacy policy</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Web site of the Napa Valley Register. We (which includes our
parent company, Lee Enterprises, Incorporated) believe in your right to know what
information is collected during your visit to our Web site(s) and how that
information is used and safeguarded.</p>

<h3>Information Automatically Gathered About All Visitors</h3>

<p>We collect aggregate and user-specific information on the pages consumers
access or visit. This information is used to generate reports that help us assess
the value of and interest in the Web site(s) we provide. We use the information we
collect to improve the content of our web pages. We can build a better site if we
know which pages our users are visiting, how often they visit and how long they
stay on a page.</p>
<p>Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's
connection to the Internet, including your IP address (but not the e-mail address),
when you visit our sites. Your IP address does not contain personally identifiable
information, nor does it identify you personally. We use this information to deliver
our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our sites to the interests of our users,
and to measure traffic within our sites.</p>
<p>To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we may utilize
a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie." A cookie is a small piece
of computer code that is deposited on your hard drive by our site. Browsers
typically recognize when a cookie has been sent to your computer and give you
the option to refuse or allow it. A cookie does not actually identify you, just the
computer that you are using to access our site. A cookie cannot read data off your
hard drive. Our advertisers, content partners and sites that are reached from links
on our site may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we
cannot control.</p>
<p>We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs so we can deliver a better
and more personalized service. It is a cookie, for example, that allows us to
deliver to you any personalized information each time you visit a site.</p>
<p>In addition, we can access cookies later in your current session or in a later
session on our site in order to improve your visit to our Web site, as in the
following examples:</p>
<h3>Payment Identification</h3>
<p>This cookie allows us to maintain information containing the products (like
photo reprints) or services (such as placing a classified advertisement or
signing up for home delivery) you are purchasing while you are online. To
limit unauthorized access, this cookie, also called a session cookie, expires
whenever you exit a browser session.</p>
<h3>Information Gathered by Voluntary Submission</h3>
<p>To make use of certain features on our Web site(s) (such as contests, story
comments, letters to the editor, personalized web pages and other interactive
forums and blogs) visitors might need to register and provide certain information
as part of the registration or participation process. We may ask, for example, for
your name, e-mail address, gender, age, and zip code, and we might request
information on your interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and
the like.</p>
<p>The information you supply will help us offer you more personalized features, to
tailor our sites to your interests and make them more useful to you. The more you
tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such
information is entirely voluntary. But if you do not supply the information we need,
we may be unable to provide you with services and content we make available to
other visitors to our sites. Of course, even if you want to remain completely
anonymous, you are still free to take advantage of the wealth of content that is
otherwise available, without registration, on our sites.</p>

<h3>Children under the Age of 13</h3>

<p>If you are under the age of 13, do not send us any information about yourself such
as your name, address or e-mail address. You may only send us personally
identifiable information if one of your parents has verified to us his or her consent
to collection of the information.</p>

<p>Because we are a media company, some of our online services and content may
be attractive to children. Because we strive to protect the privacy of all users of
our site, including children, we endeavor to comply with the Children�s Online
Privacy Protection Act. Our site:</p>
<p>- Includes our contact information.</p>
<p>- Explains the types of personal information we collect, and how we use it.</p>
<p>- Explains our practices in terms of sharing personal information with third
parties.</p>
<p>- Allows parents to consent to the collection and use of their children�s
personal information, without consenting to disclosure to third parties.
</p><p>- Does not condition a child�s participation in an activity on the child�s
providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for the activity.</p>
<p>- Allows parents to review their child�s information, have it deleted, or refuse
to permit any further collection, by contacting us.</p>
<p>We make a special effort to encourage children under the age of 13 to consult with
their parents before furnishing any personal data. However, we also believe that
parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using
parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers
that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent
children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online
without parental permission. For additional information about parental control
tools, please consult http://www.icra.org/_en/parents.</p>
<h3>E-mails from Us</h3>
<p>Upon registering with our Web site, you may begin receiving communications from
us. In addition, if you have signed up for any of our automated account services,
we will send you transactional e-mails regarding the status of your account,
including confirmations, notices of expiration and renewal and other related
electronic correspondence. If you have signed up for any of our e-mail
newsletters, you may stop receiving them if you follow the "unsubscribe"
instructions located near the bottom of each newsletter. We may send you an email
inviting you to participate in subscriber or Web site user surveys. Such
surveys greatly help us improve our services and the value of our Web site(s).
Any information you give us in those surveys will not be shared with any third
parties except in aggregate form.</p>
<h3>What We Do With the Information We Gather About You</h3>
<p>
We or one of our affiliated companies may perform statistical, marketing and
demographic analyses of our delivery subscribers and their subscription patterns.
In addition, we may generally inform our advertisers about our subscriber base.
When we present information to our advertisers -- to help them understand our
audience and confirm the value of advertising on our Web site(s) -- it is usually in
the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our sites. We
will not share individual user information with third parties unless the user has
specifically approved the release of that information. In some cases, however, we
may provide information to legal officials as described in �Compliance with Legal
Process� below.</p>
<p>In some cases, we contract with third parties to provide services on our behalf,
including credit-card and bill processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list
processing and analytics or promotions management. We provide these third
parties only with the information necessary for them to perform their specific
services. These service providers are restricted from using this information in any
way other than to provide services to us, and they may not share this information
with any one else nor may they resell this data.</p>
<h3>California Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 allows our California customers to request
certain information regarding our disclosures in the prior calendar year, if any, of
personally identifiable information to third parties for their own direct marketing
purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at Napa Valley Register 1615 Second Street, Napa, CA 94559, Attn: Marketing Department, and
include your name and the address to which you would like us to respond. We will
attempt to provide you with the requested information within thirty days of receipt.
</p><h3>Compliance with Legal Process</h3>
<p>We may disclose personal information if we or one of our affiliated companies is
required by law to disclose personal information, or if we believe in good faith that
such action is necessary to comply with a law or some legal process, to protect or
defend our rights and property, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of
our Web site(s) or to protect the personal safety or property of our users or the
public.
</p><h3>A Final Note:</h3>
<p>We are affiliated with other online companies, some of which feature our branding;
in addition there are numerous links to third parties contained on our site. Our
Privacy Policy does not apply to those companies' Web site(s), so you should refer
to each of those sites to obtain information on their privacy policies. If you cannot
find the privacy policy on any of these sites once you have arrived at their site via
a link from our site, you should contact that site directly for more information.
The web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our Privacy Policy at some
point in the future, we will post the changes before they take effect if we believe
that the change in the way we use your personal information is significant or
material. Of course, our use of information gathered while the current policy is in
effect will always be consistent with the current policy, even if we change that
policy later.</p>
