## Edinburgh Napier use of visitor statistics

When you visit the Edinburgh Napier website [www.napier.ac.uk](https://web.archive.org/), our systems automatically log and collect statistics about your visit. These statistics are very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a particular program. We only use this type of data in aggregate i.e. we look at the data collectively, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any of our users. It does however allow us to examine customer traffic patterns and website usage. This helps us to enhance the design and layout of the site making it easier to navigate. We also collect and analyse traffic on our website by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. (An IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer when you are using your browser on the internet.) We log this information in order that we can monitor data such as the number of visitors visiting the website; however, we do not link your IP address to any personally identifiable information.

## Cookies

We use a technology nicknamed "Cookies" on our website. Cookies make your visit to our website easier and improve the quality of the visitor experience.

## Security

Even the best policy cannot protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your online activities. Be aware that email is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that in extreme cases third parties are sometimes able to intercept your unencrypted messages. 

Edinburgh Napier University is concerned about the security of your personal information particularly when using our website. Although we have taken all reasonable security precautions, we cannot guarantee internet security and subsequently cannot guarantee that any information you input on our site is totally secure. In addition to our online security efforts, we have taken steps to protect your personal data offline as well. All of your information is restricted to our offices. Employees are granted access on a need-to-know basis and are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.

## Your control over your personal information
