"My NAPA" Account

When you set up your "My NAPA" Account you will be asked to provide your email address and a password. As well as provide information regarding your vehicle. The information you provide in your "My NAPA" Account allows NAPAonline.com to personalize searches and facilitate the ordering process. During registration of your "My NAPA" Account, NAPAonline.com will ask for your name, address, email address and other personal information, including data about your automobile. The more information you voluntarily provide (and the more accurate it is), the better NAPAonline.com will be able to customize your experience. 

Ordering

Our website utilizes both a shopping cart and email forms for customers to request information, products, and services. We may collect customers' contact information (such as email addresses), financial information (such as account or credit card numbers). This information enables us to process and fulfill our customers' orders and notify our customers of their order status. When you provide credit card information on our online form, you are connected to a secure server, which encrypts credit card information over the Internet. 

Surveys and Promotions

We may occasionally request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age income level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. We may also use this data to personalize the customer's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. In addition, this information may be used internally by NAPAonline.com for market analysis and other purposes and may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis (i.e. all personal information will be removed).

How Does NAPA Online Protect the Information it Collects?

To provide you with an increased level of security, access to your personal information is protected with a password which you select. We strongly recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone. 

Registration & Financial Information

All personal information that you provide to NAPAonline.com including names, addresses, contact information, and credit card numbers - are stored in a secure database. This database is located in a physically secure facility and is located behind multiple "firewalls". NAPAonline.com periodically performs external "ethical hacking" exercises to detect and eliminate potential breaches of security. 

Secure Server

When you place orders through our website, you will transmit your order information, including your credit card number, to our secure server. Our secure server uses Secure Sockets Layer Software (SSL) which allows us to receive information that your Web server encrypts before transmitting to us. Since any order information you provide to NAPAonline.com will be transmitted using a secure connection, customers with Web browsers that cannot support this level of security will not be able to order products through NAPAonline.com. To ensure that you are conducting a secure transaction, please look for a small padlock icon in the lower right corner of your browser before you send your information. Should this icon not be available, please notify NAPAonline.com immediately and DO NOT send your information . 

Display of Credit Card Information

NAPAonline.com will never display more than five digits of your credit card number on the screen or on any invoices which are sent to you. 

Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

Does NAPA Online Share Its Information with Other Companies?

General

NAPAonline.com does not sell your personal information to any third parties. However, we may provide your information to trustworthy third parties (including "My Local NAPA Stores") so that they can send you product and service offers that may be of interest. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by checking the appropriate box when opening or modifying their "My NAPA" account. In the event that you have registered more than one email address with us, please check the opt-out box for each email account you use. 

Aggregate Statistics

NAPAonline.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors. However, these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

Credit Card Verification

Please note that when you order products and services from NAPAonline.com we will use a credit verification company to validate the credit card and other information you provide before we can fill your order. We have an agreement with such company to ensure that our customers' personal information is kept confidential. Not only is it the same credit verification process that would be used if you presented your credit card at any NAPA store, but there is an additional safeguard in that the billing information you provide for your credit card enables us to verify that you are the rightful owner of the card. 

What are "Cookies"? How Are they used by NAPA Online?

"Cookies" are pieces of information that our website can send to your browser and which can later be stored on your computer's hard drive so that we can recognize you when you return.
