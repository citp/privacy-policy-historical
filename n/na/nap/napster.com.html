		<div class="boldLargehdr">NAPSTER PRIVACY POLICY</div>
		Effective April 25, 2006<br>
		Welcome to Napster. We value your privacy, and we want you to know what information
		we collect and what we do with it.
		<br><br>

		Napster is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent,
		non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the
		Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement
		covers the site <a href="http://www.napster.com">www.napster.com</a> and all products and services offered at the site,
		including Napster's free, web-based music service and "n-archive", Napster's premium music services and the "Shop Napster" online store that can be linked to from the site and from the premium music service. Because Napster wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.
		<br><br>

		If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact
		<a href="mailto:privacy@napster.com">privacy@napster.com</a>. If you do not receive
		acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed,
		you should then contact TRUSTe <a href="http://www.truste.org/watchdog.html" target="_blank">http://www.truste.org/watchdog.html</a>.
		TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.
		<br><br>

		The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does
		not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.
		<br><br>

		Napster complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce
		regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.
		<br><br>

		From time to time, we may make changes to this policy, so please review it frequently. Whenever
		we make a change, we will post or otherwise make available the revised policy. We will endeavor
		to post the changes before they become effective. The effective date of the most recent version
		of this policy will appear at the top of this page. This policy applies to any information we
		collect from you. If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by
		email or by means of a notice on our home page and/or sign-page that you must view to enter the
		service.
		<br><br>

		<div class="boldhdr">WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</div>
		We have several areas where you can submit information to us, and we also have features that
		automatically collect information from users of our service.
		<br><br>

		<div class="boldhdr">INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US.</div>
		We have certain areas where we ask you to provide information to us:<br>
		<span class="UnderlineCopy">For the Napster Website (and free web services) and for Napster's premium services:</span>
		<br><br>

		<div class="bulletPoint">•</div> <div class="bulletPointCopy"><span class="ItalicCopy">Browsing the Site.</span>  If you are simply browsing the Napster site, you will not be required to register with Napster or provide any other personal data.  We may track your site usage on a non-personally identifiable basis for our own internal use or to share with third<br> parties.</div>
		<br class="clearbothList">

		<div class="bulletPoint">•</div> <div class="bulletPointCopy"><span class="ItalicCopy">Registration, Services.</span> You must register with us to use any of our services, including services offered at the site, such as the free streaming music service (the "Music Service"), the free user-contributed music encyclopedia ("n-archive") and more (collectively and together with the site, the "Web Services")  ) and/or our digital music services that may require additional registration, software download(s) and/or payment (the "Premium Services").  Some of the Premium Services may be integrated with the site and with some<br> or all of the Web Services, including via use of the same member name.  Currently, these include a digital music store (the "Music Store")" that lets you purchase permanent downloads of songs and a music subscription service (the "Subscription Service").  The terms and conditions of use of the Web Services can be accessed at <a href="http://www.napster.com/terms/">http://www.napster.com/terms/</a>, while the terms and conditions of use for the Premium Services can be accessed at <a href="http://www.napster.com/terms/service_terms.html">http://www.napster.com/terms/service_terms.html</a>. We may also offer options for you to sign up for our mailing lists without having to use any product or service.</div>
		<br class="clearbothList">

		<div class="bulletPoint">•</div> <div class="bulletPointCopy"><span class="ItalicCopy">Non-Biling Registration.</span>  If you register for any of the Web Services, you will automatically be eligible to become a member of the other services offered from our site, including the Premium Services, using the same username and password, though you may need to complete additional registration steps for certain services.. During this joint registration, you will be asked to provide your email address, and to choose a member name and password.  You may also be asked during registration, but not required, to provide further information about yourself (such as favorite genre, IM client, age, city, state, interests, brief bio), some of which may be part of your "Public Profile" that other service users will be able to access as part of Napster's "Community Features" as described further below.</div>
		<br class="clearbothList">

		<div class="bulletPoint">•</div> <div class="bulletPointCopy"><span class="ItalicCopy">Billing Registration.</span> After you register for the Web Services, if you decide to purchase any items from us (via Shop Napster, the Music Store or otherwise) and/or register for the Subscription Service, you will be required to provide credit card and personal billing information.  If you register for our Subscription Service, any billing information that you provide will be used to bill you for a recurring subscription fee which may vary depending upon the tier of service and billing option that you select.  For certain promotional offers, you may be able to access the Subscription Service without first providing a credit card.  The Subscription Service has a standard tier, as well as a "Napster To Go" tier, for which you may register and pay an additional amount.</div>
		<br class="clearbothList">

		<div class="bulletPoint">•</div> <div class="bulletPointCopy"><span class="ItalicCopy">Communications from Us and Mailing Lists.</span> In order to keep our members informed about the operation of our site and services, we may send e-mails and announcements to your personal email address that you have provided to us upon registration. ForMusic Storeand Subscription Service users, we may also send promotional emails to your service "Inbox" (described below). For additional information and offers, we give our members the option of joining our mailing lists and/or those of other promotional partners that we think will be of interest to you (see "With Whom We Share Your Information" below). You can change your options in the "My Account" section of the applicable service. Each promotional e-mail from us will come with instructions for how to unsubscribe from the mailing list. We may send emails via third-party service providers that act on our behalf.</div>

We may retain your emails and other information you submit to us for our internal purposes and to help us to serve you better.</div>

		<div class="bulletPoint">•</div> <div class="bulletPointCopy"><span class="ItalicCopy">Community Features.</span> We also may offer community features designed to help members find songs, articles or information that they may be interested in.  For example, Premium Services members may view songs that other members have recently streamed or made part of their personal music collections, and n-archive users may view entries submitted by other n-archive users.  In all cases, only a user's member name will be shown in connection with features like these (and, if you have created one, other members will be able to access your Public Profile).   However, with respect to the Premium Services, during registration or at any time afterwards in the "My Account" section of the service, you may choose to have your membername hidden from other service members for these purposes. With respect to the n-archive, all of your entries will be attributed to your user name and you may not make your entries anonymously.  members may also be offered access to features such as public message boards. All personal information you send or post via community features, including in your Public Profile or any entry on the Napster site, becomes public information.

Messages may contain compilations of Napster tracks as well as a brief amount of text. Napster will keep copies of those messages for as long as you keep them in your Inbox. We may monitor such messages via electronic software or personnel to check for obscenity, defamation or other types of abusive language, as well as for content that may infringe our rights or the rights of others, all of which we may remove at any time. We will not otherwise access these messages except in unusual cases, including but not limited to times when we receive specific complaints related to a particular message or are compelled to do so by law. To maintain storage capacity, we expect to regularly delete message files, including messages in any user's Inbox, that are older than 30 days and we reserve the right to do so more or less frequently. Also for administrative purposes, we will keep a mail log that will include a record of which users sent messages and to which users or email addresses they were sent. We will use the addressee information you enter only to send the emails you request.</div>

		<br class="clearbothList">

		<div class="bulletPoint">•</div> <div class="bulletPointCopy"> As you are using our services or sites, you may click through certain links or promotions that will enable you to purchase products or use services provided by promotional partners or other sites or commerce providers. Some of those entities may share with us certain information that you provide to them. By clicking through to those links or promotions, you agree to allow us to receive and use any information, except for credit card information (account number, expiration date) that you may provide to such entities, under the same terms as if you provided it to us directly.</div>
		<br class="clearbothList">

		<div class="bulletPoint">•</div> <div class="bulletPointCopy">You may also separately share your information with other sites or entities, such as those that create professional marketing lists, to receive special offers and promotions from its partners. These entities or sites may agree to share your information with us. Whether or not any third party actually shares your information and to what extent they do share with us will depend on their agreement with us and their individual privacy policy. Napster is not responsible and will assume no liability if another site or commerce provider collects, uses or shares, any information about you in violation of its own privacy policy, or applicable law.</div>
		<br class="clearbothList">

		<div class="bulletPoint">•</div> <div class="bulletPointCopy">We may purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested. To enrich our profiles of individual customers, we may tie this information to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us.</div>
		<br class="clearbothList"><br>

		<div class="boldhdr">AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION</div>
		<span class="ItalicCopy">Napster Site.</span>  As you browse our site and as you use any of the Web Services, we may track your movement through the site through our web logs.  We will only use this data on an aggregated basis with that of other users for general business purposes, such as site analysis and ad sales.
		<br><br>

		<span class="ItalicCopy">Napster Client.</span> After you register for any of the Premium Services (or when you first want to utilize the Napster Music Store), you will be prompted to download our Napster Client software application. In order to make sure the Napster Client is functioning at its best, from time to time we may send the Napster Client automatic fixes, support files, etc. Napster employs software that is used to protect the copyrights associated with the tracks you listen to or obtain. In order to make sure that artists and copyright owners receive applicable royalties, this software identifies and counts the songs you have obtained and/or accessed including, if you are a Napster To Go member, tracks that you may have listened to offline on compatible portable devices. At the aggregate level (i.e., not tied to the personally identifying information of any user), we use this data to report and pay royalties, for internal analysis and we share this data with certain promotional or other business partners or advisors of ours for their own analysis. <span class="boldtextUnderlineCopy">We do not share your personally identifying usage data with any third parties.</span> We may use your personally identifying usage data for a variety of service-related purposes.
		<br><br>

		From time to time, the security on the Napster Client software may be upgraded by our supplier, which is currently Microsoft. Microsoft advises us that for security upgrades, your player will connect to an Internet site operated by Microsoft and will be sent a security file, along with a unique identifier, which does not contain any personal information about you and is not used to personally identify you or track your activities. Microsoft uses this information to prevent security breaches that could affect you. For more information, please feel free to read Microsoft's privacy policy at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/windowsmedia/software/v7/privacy.asp#_Security_Upgrade_(Individualization)" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/windowsmedia/software/v7/privacy.asp#_Security_Upgrade_(Individualization)</a>.
		<br><br>

		Further, when you access the service through a promotional partner of ours and download the Napster Client, we will add certain of your registration information (such as your member name and, if applicable, the partner or promotion through which you registered) to the registry settings on your computer's hard drive, so that we can recognize which of our partners or other sign-in pages to send to you when you log on to the service.
		<br><br>

		<span class="ItalicCopy">Cookies.</span> We use cookies for several purposes. Within all of the Napster services, we use what are commonly called "session" cookies, meaning that they only last as long as you are online. We use these cookies to identify you as a valid member so that we can deliver music to you, to ensure that no one else can sign on simultaneously with your account from another computer and to help us personalize your service experience based on your registration preferences (such as genre choice, your connection speed, your preference with regard to receiving songs that contain explicit lyrics and the country you live in). We may also use session cookies to help us facilitate any promotions or surveys that we provide.  Within the Shop Napster site, we may also use session cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. These cookies do not contain any personally identifying information and we do not store data collected by them.
		<br><br>

		As part of the sign-in process for our services or for Shop Napster, we may also use what are commonly called "persistent" cookies which stay with you after your session is over and you are offline. We use these cookies in connection with a sign-in feature that allows you to save your member name and password so that the next time you sign in, these fields will be pre-populated for you. If we make this cookie available, it can only be activated if you select that option during your sign-in. If you select that option you can always deselect it each time you sign-in.
		<br><br>

		We sometimes use cookies, as well as tracking technology, such as web beacons, within the promotional emails that we send to our members or advertisements for our service or sites. These technologies help us to track, for example, whether an e-mail recipient has completed an event, such as signing up for a free trial. The generated information is related to non-personally identifying customer identification numbers and is only analyzed at aggregate levels.
		<br><br>

		We sometimes utilize third party service providers to help us track the activity and user flows within our service or sites. These third parties may use temporary cookies and/or web beaconing technology to facilitate such tracking. Such tracking would track an individual user's movements but the data would not be tracked in a personally identifiable way. Such data would be stored and analyzed on an aggregated basis for purposes of internal analysis by Napster to improve the service.
		<br><br>

		<span class="UnderlineCopy">Third Party Advertising and Use of Cookies</span>
		<br><br>

		Most Ads appearing on our websites are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visits to our site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used by Doubleclick to serve ads to you.   In the course of serving advertisements to our site, Doubleclick may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please click here: <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy</a>.  Like Napster, Doubleclick is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.   In addition to Doubleclick, we may work with other  advertisers and other third parties whose products or services are promoted on our site or within our services that may also use cookies.   In those cases, we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other privacy practices.
		<br><br>

		<span class="UnderlineCopy">Other.</span> In order to personalize our service for your enjoyment and to monitor and improve the performance of our technology, we capture other data such as members' search and browse criteria and results. We only share this data on an aggregate basis. Also for internal purposes, we gather information such as date, time, connection speed and IP address of all service users. We keep this information for our internal security audit log, aggregate trend analysis, and system administration.
