| At NAEIR, we respect your concerns about privacy and want you to be confident that the information you provide will be secure. Following is a step-by-step process, explaining how the information that you provide will be used.  
  
---  
There are three areas on NAEIR's web site where information can be provided, the membership inquiry template, the membership application template and the corporate relations template. The only information that we are collecting is demographic information so that we can provide you with additional information regarding NAEIR's program.  
  
After completing the template and submitting your request, the information is received at NAEIR in an e-mail format. It is not retained in the web site. This e-mail is printed so that the information can be entered into NAEIR's database and the e-mail is deleted.  
  
The demographic information you provide is entered into a proprietary database that can only be accessed by NAEIR employees. To access the database the employee must use a unique login I.D. and password. The information will be used to generate letters and mailing envelopes to provide you with the additional information about NAEIR that you have requested.  
  
Your record will be stored in our database for possible future mailings from NAEIR, but you will only receive mailings from NAEIR. We do not sell or give information to anyone.  
  
We also do not allow third party advertising on our web site and we have only one link available through our web site, which is to Guidestar.org so that interested visitors to our web site can find out more information about NAEIR.  
  
Should you wish to change any of the information that you have provided, please call NAEIR and speak with either a membership advocate or a corporate relations representative at (309) 343-0704 (press 8 to speak with a membership advocate or press 6 to speak with a corporation relations representative).
