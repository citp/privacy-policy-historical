<u><b>Naughty Webcams takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. </b> </u><br><br>
<b>What this Privacy Policy Covers</b><br> This Privacy Policy covers Naughty Webcams treatment of personally identifiable information that Naughty Webcams collects when you are on the Naughty Webcams site, and when you use Naughty Webcams services. This policy also covers Naughty Webcams treatment of any personally identifiable information that Naughty Webcams business partners share with Naughty Webcams.  <br><br>
Naughty Webcams is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Naughty Webcams collects information from our users at several different points on our website.
 <br><br>
<b>Membership Registration</b><br> 
We request information from the user on our signup form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and postal address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 
<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. We do not recommend the use of cookies. The reason is that anyone who has access to your computer, may access our site with your user information.    <br>
<br>

<b>Log Files</b><br>We use IP addresses to analyze advertising, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  
<br><br>
<b>Sharing</b><br>
 
We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for  services. This company does  not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
We partner with other parties to provide specific advertising services. We will not share names, or other contact information with these third parties.  
 <br>
<br>
<b>Links</b><br>
This web site may contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we Naughty Webcams are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.              

 <br>
<br>
<b>Security</b><br>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.  
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.  
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.  
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to security@naughtywebcams.com. 

 <br><br>

<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b><br>
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support.
<br><br>
 

<b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
