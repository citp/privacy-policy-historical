# NAFSA - Privacy Policy

#### January 2002

NAFSA respects the privacy of its members and other visitors to its Web site. NAFSA strongly believes that if electronic commerce and online activities are to flourish, consumers must be assured that information provided online is used responsibly and appropriately. To protect online privacy, NAFSA has implemented the following policy.

## What Information Does NAFSA Collect?

Most data NAFSA collects are used only to help NAFSA better serve its members. It is our general policy to collect and store only information that our members and visitors knowingly provide.

### From General Visitors

NAFSA does not collect any information from visitors browsing its Web site. Visitors to the public areas of NAFSA's Web site browse anonymously. Only aggregate data -- such as the number of hits per page -- are collected. Aggregate data are only used for internal and marketing purposes and do not provide any personally identifying information.

### From NAFSA Members, Conference Registrants, and Other Visitors

To gain access to members-only resources and personalization features on the NAFSA Web site, members and other visitors are asked to register and provide some limited information. These data are submitted voluntarily. NAFSA asks visitors to provide their name, member number (for members), organization name, business phone, and e-mail. Similar information may be submitted to NAFSA through membership applications, conference or seminar registration, publication orders, and subscriptions. NAFSA only uses this information to enhance its products and distribution of those products to its members.

## How Does NAFSA Use Data Collected?

Generally, NAFSA uses data collected to improve its own Web content; to respond to members' interests, needs and preferences; and to develop new products and services.

### Rental of Postal and E-Mail Addresses

Registrants for conferences and member applicants give permission for NAFSA to rent its mailing and e-mail lists, unless such permission is expressly denied. Members can change their mail and e-mail list permission on-line by editing their profiles. Members or visitors may change preferences by contacting NAFSA at data[at]nafsa.org or by calling 202-737-3699. Rental of member and visitor mailing and e-mail addresses is governed by NAFSA's List Rental Policy.

### Credit Card Account Information

When members or visitors provide credit card account information to NAFSA or its agents (publishing house, registration processing company, etc.), NAFSA submits the information needed to obtain payment to the appropriate financial institution. NAFSA does not further disclose credit card account information obtained from members or visitors.

## How Does NAFSA Use Cookies?

Cookies are files that contain information created by a Web server that can be stored on a visitor's hard disk for use either during a particular session ("per-session" cookie) or for future use ("persistent" cookie). NAFSA uses cookies only to facilitate automated activity, and to store and track passwords. Cookies are not used to disseminate significant information about visitors over the Internet or to analyze any information that visitors have knowingly or unknowingly provided. Visitors may instruct their Internet browsers to opt out of accepting a "persistent" cookie and rather accept only a "per-session" cookie, but will need to login each time they visit the site to enjoy the full benefits. If the visitor declines the attachment of any cookie, the visitor may not have access to the full benefits of the Web site. Registration enables the site to better determine members' interest areas and provide the most relevant information.

## What Privacy Issues Arise With Links To Other Sites?

This Web site contains links to other Web sites. NAFSA has no control over and is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of such sites.
