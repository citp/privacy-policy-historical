  2. to provide the applicable registry with authoritative data to ensure the ongoing continuity, stability and resiliency of the DNS; 
  3. mitigation of DNS abuse, including but not limited to the investigation and mitigation of reported instances of abuse Name.com considers to be contrary to the terms of its Acceptable Use Policy;
  4. maintained integrity of the current dual failsafe system at the registrar and registry levels;
  5. verification of registrant eligibility, where applicable; and
  6. to update and improve our Services, systems and ability to provide you with a secure and stable Service experience.



OTHER WAYS WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

First and foremost, Name.com uses your Registration Data to arrange your registration and supported functionality of your domain(s) with the registry operator. Additionally, Name.com may use Registrant Data to (i) improve our Services, promotions and functionality, (ii) develop and collect aggregate statistics (ensuring appropriate anonymization) regarding our systems and Services,; and (iii) communicate with you regarding your registration or related Services.

DATA CONTROLLER ROLES

We collect and processes your Registrant Data to carry out the registration of your domain, to ensure that your registration functions as expected, and that registrations do not affect the security of our registrar. In order to enter your chosen domain name into our system, we are required to process your data in a manner obligated in our contracts with Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”). In this respect, it is our understanding under applicable law that we act as a joint data controller of your Registrant Data, working in conjunction with the TLD registry and ICANN, as herein described. 

REGISTRAR

With specific reference to the registration of a domain name, as Registrar, we are responsible for the following:

  1. collection of registration data;
  2. providing you notice and an opportunity to review both our Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the relevant registry; 
  3. providing you with adequate information and a means by which you may exercise your individual privacy rights, such as data access, deletion, and rectification; and
  4. this Privacy Policy sets out, in detail, both the purposes and the legal basis for our data processing. 



REGISTRY OPERATOR

A registry operator, retains the responsibility for the processing of data necessary for the registration and maintenance of domains within one of their TLDs.

CHOICE OF REGISTRY: You should only choose a TLD with whom you feel comfortable sharing your information. It is important that you familiarize yourself with and understand the individual and specific privacy policy of the registry who is responsible for the TLD of your choice. See the list of specific privacy policies, that relate to each TLD [here](https://web.archive.org/policies/additional-registry-requirements). If you do not understand such policies, or you have questions regarding any of their policies, you should discuss this with the registry operator of your chosen domain, prior to registering via our service. 

ICANN

ICANN is the private-sector body responsible for coordinating the global Internet's systems of unique identifiers. The mission of ICANN is to coordinate the stable operation of the Internet's unique identifier systems. More information about ICANN can be found here: [www.icann.org](http://www.icann.org/). ICANN is responsible for identifying and requiring, by contract, both registry operators and registrars to provide to them registration data. Registrant Data we collect and process is data which ICANN deems necessary to ensure the ongoing security and stability of the DNS. 

NAME.COM HOSTING SERVICE

DATA PROCESSOR

When you choose Name.com as your hosting provider, please note that any video, image, or other content posted, uploaded or otherwise made available by you, at your discretion as user (data controller), onto your website, whether published content or not, is not considered personally identifiable information, therefore is not subject to our Privacy Policy. 

In all hosting agreements, Name.com merely processes such data on your behalf, subject to the terms of the [Web Hosting Services Agreement](https://web.archive.org/policies/webhosting-agreement) you are expected to have due regard to applicable legal requirements regarding your own use of data on Name.com hosting. 

DISCLOSURE OF REGISTRANT AND HOSTING DATA

There are instances where Name.com may have to disclose your personal data. At all times however, such disclosure shall be limited and subject to the required safeguards. 

WHOIS 

Depending on applicable law, where necessary, Registration Data shall be made available to the public via an interactive webpage ([https://www.name.com/whois-lookup](https://web.archive.org/whois-lookup)) and via a "port 43" WHOIS service. It is important that you review your registry operators’ individual WHOIS publication policy also prior to entering into a registration agreement. 

In the event you elect to utilize a [privacy service](https://web.archive.org/account/whois-privacy), the information of that service, rather than your personal WHOIS Information, will be made available to the public. Please note that we are not able to control how members of the public may use the WHOIS Information.

Where the disclosure of personal data, such as is envisaged by WHOIS, is considered to be incompatible with applicable law, Name.com will, to the best of its ability and wholly dependent on the accuracy of the data provided by you, ensure that such personal data is not unnecessarily disclosed. 

LIMITED DISCLOSURE WHERE NECESSARY

Name.com may continue disclose elements of this data, but will only do so in a manner as outlined under the Exceptions To Disclosure section below. It is important that you also review your registry operators’ individual WHOIS publication policy also prior to entering into a registration agreement to ensure you are aware of the extent to which your personal data may be subject to disclosure. 

THIRD PARTIES PROCESSING DATA ON OUR BEHALF

DATA ESCROW (DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATIONS ONLY)

Name.com, as Registrar, is required by ICANN to provide a copy of all registration data (including PI and non PI) to a secure third party who shall hold the data securely in Escrow (“Escrow Provider”). Name.com utilizes the services of ‘Iron Mountain Inc.’, a US Corporation, with servers in the United States, as its Escrow Provider. Data held by the Escrow Provider can be used to restore a registry in the event of a catastrophic event, or a failure of the registry’s systems. In this case, the data may be securely transferred to another registry to ensure the ongoing security and stability of the DNS and to prevent any interruption to the proper functioning of registered domains.
