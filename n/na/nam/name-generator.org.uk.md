  * Some saved historic content may be deleted if it has not been accessed for a long period of time, so as to free up resources for new customers.
  * We store email addresses for the purposes of notifications about future developments. We only do this where you explicitly provide your email address for this purpose and click the verification link in a confirmation email.
  * When you leave comments on the Masterpiece Generator blog or creations themselves, we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also your IP address and sometimes browser user agent string to help spam detection.
