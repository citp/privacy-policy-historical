<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: 28 May 2013</p>
<p>We respect and protect the privacy of our users and take
appropriate steps to safeguard your personal information. This Privacy
Policy outlines NameMesh’ commitment to practices regarding the
collection, sharing and use of information from users of the
NameMesh.com website (the “Website”). If we make changes to this
policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on the Website and
change the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
Persons under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Website.</p>
<h2>Information Collection and Usage</h2>
Like most website operators, NameMesh collects
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
visitor request. NameMesh’s purpose in collecting non-personally
identifying information is to better understand how NameMesh’s visitors
use its website.
NameMesh also collects personal information from you,
such as name and email address, when you sign up for our service or contact us by email.
We also track the actions you take on our site in order to improve the service.
We will never share this information with anyone for any reason unless required by law.
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the
website each time the visitor returns. NameMesh uses cookies to help
NameMesh identify and track visitors, their usage of NameMesh website,
and their website access preferences. NameMesh visitors who do not
wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their
browsers to refuse cookies before using NameMesh’s websites, with the
drawback that certain features of NameMesh’s websites may not function
properly without the aid of cookies. We use cookies to uniquely
identify your session for a more efficient user experience while
visiting our Website.</p>
<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users
by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the
ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your
computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by
NameMesh and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
<p>NameMesh does not disclose, sell or rent your personally
identifiable information or search data to any third parties except
for statistical purposes as outline above. NameMesh discloses
personally identifiable information and potentially personally
identifiable information (such as your IP address) only to those of
its employees, service providers and affiliated organizations that (i)
need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or
to provide, operate or provide services for the Website, and (ii) that
have agreed not to disclose it to others. We may disclose personally
identifiable information to cooperate with law enforcement
authorities, a court or administrative agency, or other governmental
authority in connection with an investigation or where required by
applicable law. We may also disclose any activities or information
about you to law enforcement, other government officials or other
third parties (such as intellectual property owners) as we, in our
sole discretion, determine necessary or appropriate, in connection
with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements,
or any other activity that is illegal or may expose NameMesh, its
users or other third parties to harm. If NameMesh, or substantially
all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that
NameMesh goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information
would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third
party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
acquirer of NameMesh may continue to use your personal information as
set forth in this policy.</p>
<h2>Information Security</h2>
<p>The security of your personally identifiable information is
important to us. We use reasonable security measures to help protect this
information, including without limitation, limiting access to your
personal information to those of our employees and service providers
who require it to operate the Website and provide services to you.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to
protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee
its absolute security.</p>
<h2>Contacting Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about our Privacy Policy
or practices, please contact us via e-mail at contact@namemesh.com.</p>
<h2>Links to Third Party Sites</h2>
<p>This Policy only applies to the NameMesh website and services.
We do not exercise control over the sites that our service links to.
These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your
computer, and collect data or solicit personal information from you.
It is the sole responsibility of such third parties to
adhere to any applicable restrictions on the disclosure of your
personally-identifying information, and NameMesh and its affiliates
shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of your
personally-identifying information by any third party.
We encourage you to read privacy policies of any third-party sites
you visit.
</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>NameMesh may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in
NameMesh’s sole discretion. NameMesh encourages visitors to frequently
check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Visitors can
always check the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document to
see when the Privacy Policy was last changed. Your continued use of
this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
acceptance of such change.</p>
