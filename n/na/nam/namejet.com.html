		Share the Information It Receives?</h3>
	<p>
		Yes, we do share information with at least the entities listed below:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>WHOIS:</dt>
		<dd>
			We are required by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"),
			the organization that assumes responsibility for domain name allocation, to collect
			information about you during the domain name registration process. This information
			includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where
			provided, your facsimile number. ICANN then requires all registrars to make your
			full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your
			facsimile number, as well as the creation and expiration dates of your domain name
			registration and the name server information associated with your domain name, to
			the public via an interactive Web page and a "port 43" WHOIS service. For the purposes
			of this Privacy Policy we will refer to this information as your "WHOIS Information."
			Please note that we may not be able to control how members of the public may use
			the WHOIS Information.</dd>
		<dt>Advertisers:</dt>
		<dd>
			We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.</dd>
		<dt>Partners:</dt>
		<dd>
			We partner with other third party providers of specific services. When the user
			signs up for these services, we will share names, e-mail addresses, or other contact
			information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.</dd>
		<dt>Agents:</dt>
		<dd>
			We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
			include processing credit card payments, providing marketing assistance, providing
			customer services, sending postal mail and email to you, removing repetitive information
			from customer lists, and analyzing data. These persons have access to user information
			needed to perform their functions for the benefit of the user. These companies may,
			or may not, retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information that
			you provide to
			NameJet
			for any secondary purposes.</dd>
		<dt>Service Providers:</dt>
		<dd>
			We engage other companies and individuals to perform enhanced services on our behalf.
			For example, we my engage another service provider to provide free electronic mail
			services to our domain name registrants. Many of our service providers have access
			to personal information needed to perform these kinds of services.</dd>
		<dt>Business Transfer:</dt>
		<dd>
			As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their
			assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred
			business assets. Also, if
			NameJet
			, or substantially all of its assets, were ever to be acquired, customer information
			will of course be one of the transferred assets.</dd>
		<dt>Compliance:</dt>
		<dd>
			We release account and other personal information when we believe release is required
			to comply with federal or state law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other
			agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
			NameJet
			, our users, or others. This includes at least exchanging information with other
			companies, organizations and members of law enforcement to protect against fraud
			or other criminal activity.</dd>
