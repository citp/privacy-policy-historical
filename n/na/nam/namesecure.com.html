<p class="text">
NameSecure is in the business of putting people in touch with other
people. That requires more than simply offering innovative technical
services. It also requires that we understand you, our customer, and
your needs. Indeed, we are the Internet's leading domain name registrar
because we have taken the time to get acquainted with each one of our
many customers.
</p>
<p class="text">We get to know you primarily through the information
you provide to us when signing up for, or using, one or more of our
services. The information you provide ranges from basic contact
information, to payment information, to the technical coordinates of
your host servers. The application for domain name registration
services found at <a href="http://www.namesecure.com/">www.namesecure.com</a>
is a representative illustration of the information we request of you.
All of the information we request from you when purchasing our services
is obligatory unless otherwise noted on the relevant form. When you
purchase our services, you agree to provide and maintain accurate,
complete and updated information.
</p>
<p class="text">After you have signed up for our services, we may be in
communication with you about your account, technical questions you may
have about services provided by us, or any other matter relating to
those services. Those communications are essential to our relationship
with you and to our ability to provide you with quality services that
are responsive to your needs. At the same time, those communications
give us helpful insights about you, your preferences and the ways in
which we might improve our services. We therefore may maintain this
information for future use.
</p>
<p class="text">For operational and quality assurance purposes, we take
note of whether and how you use the information and services that we
provide, such as by recording site traffic patterns and by maintaining
log files of users' access to site files.
</p>
<p class="text">The information we receive from or about you is stored
on systems designed to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access,
disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information. We also
encrypt your transmission of sensitive information to us (e.g., credit
card numbers, account passwords) in the interest of heightened privacy
protection and information integrity. Transactions within our My
Account manager and purchase flows use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption when transmitting data from your connection to our systems.
You may click the lock icon within your web browser to verify the
authenticity of any or our SSL certificates.

<p class="text"><b><a name="howwe"></a>How We Put Information to Good Use </b></p>
<p class="text">We use information about you for purposes of monitoring
and improving our internal operations, as well as to ensure we: (i)
bill you properly, (ii) administer your account in accordance with your
agreements with us, and (iii) properly perform the services you have
requested.
</p>
<p class="text">We also use the information we collect to monitor and
improve our internal operations, as well as to improve the experience
of users in our network of sites. For example, we may correlate Web
site traffic information with data about individual users. This data
helps us to determine how much our customers use parts of the site,
allowing us to enhance it to fit the needs of as many of our customers
as possible. We may also break down overall usage statistics according
to customers' domain names, browser types, and MIME types by reading
this information from the browser string (information contained in
every user's browser).
</p>
<p class="text">Another example of our use of information to enhance
the experience of users in our network of sites is our reliance on
cookie files. We use cookie files to make it easier for users to access
our site or services. A cookie file is a small data file that certain
Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file
can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track
the pages you have visited. However, the only personal information a
cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot
read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other
sites. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described
above) when you register for NameSecure services. When you register, we
may use a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We use this ID to
identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you
visit on our site.
</p>
<p class="text">If you have set your browser to warn you before
accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each
cookie. You may refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser;
however, some of our sites may require a cookie for access.
</p>
<p class="text">Finally, we use the information we collect to direct
important notices and information affecting your account or services,
as well as to provide general information that may be of interest to
you, including newsletters, surveys, contest and sweepstake
announcements, and information about our service or product offerings
or the offerings of our business affiliates. You may opt-out of
receiving information from us simply by notifying us of your desire in
accordance with the opt-out instructions contained in any information
message you receive from us, or by visiting us at <a href="/privacyPolicy/privacyPolicyUseInfo/accountManager.do">https://www.namesecure.com/myaccount</a>.
Note, however, that in order to fulfill our service obligations to you,
we must continue sending you notices and other important information
affecting your account or services.

 <div class="details">
<p class="text"><b><a name="withwhom"></a>With Whom We May Share Information</b></p>
<p class="text">Pursuant to arrangements with Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers ('ICANN'), we compile and maintain a
publicly accessible registration database that includes basic
information about each domain name registered with us, including the
names, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of individuals designated
as points of contact for a given domain name. Whether or not applicable
domain name registration fees have been paid is also publicly
accessible. With the gradual continued privatization of the Domain Name
System, and consistent with the rules or policies applicable to that
system, or to comply with any changes in law or regulation, we may, if
appropriate, take steps to restrict the accessibility and amount of
personally identifying information available in the registration
database
</p>
<p class="text">When you register a domain name through us, we must
disclose your domain name and its associated Internet Protocol ("IP")
numbers to the appropriate registry in order to make your chosen domain
name a functional address on the Internet. Certain registries also
require that we disclose to them the names, postal addresses, telephone
and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses of individuals designated as the
registrant or points of contact for a given domain name. Each registry
discloses certain portions (and in some cases all) of the information
we are required to provide to them about your domain name registration.
For example, each registry discloses at least each registered domain
name and its associated IP numbers ("TLD zone files") to TLD server
administrators so that the domain name is capable of functioning as an
address on the Internet. Consistent with the current rules and policies
for the Domain Name System, such registries also disclose the TLD zone
files to other interested persons, provided those persons agree, among
other things, not to use the TLD zone files for improper purposes,
including the transmission of unsolicited commercial e-mail. Similarly,
each registry may compile and maintain a publicly accessible database
that includes basic information about each domain name registered with
that registry, including the names, telephone and fax numbers, and
e-mail addresses of individuals designated as the registrant or points
of contact for a given domain name. </p>
<p class="text">
We may share certain information about you with those of our vendors
who are responsible for handling your account or performing other
services that you require. Although we may share sensitive financial
information (i.e., credit card numbers, banking information), security
information (e.g., account passwords) and personal communications
(e.g., personal e-mail messages or message board postings) with such
vendors where necessary and appropriate, we will not share such
information with other third parties, except in response to formal
requests (e.g., subpoena or court order) made in connection with
litigation, arbitration, or criminal proceedings directly relating to a
domain name registration or other services we provide, or as directed
by you or your agent. </p>
<p class="text">
Please note, however, that consistent with the current rules and
policies for the Domain Name System, information about you must remain
available in the publicly accessible registration database.

registration database look-up services. These services give users
access to such data on a query-by-query basis. Pursuant to our
arrangements with ICANN, qualified persons may also access such data on
