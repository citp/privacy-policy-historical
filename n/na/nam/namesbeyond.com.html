              <td class="contNormal">Except as set out in this Privacy Policy, you will receive notice whenever personal information (excluding WHOIS Information) about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share that information. We share personal information as described below: <br>
                • <span class="contHiglight">WHOIS Information:</span> ICANN, the regulator for all gTLD domain names, requires NamesBeyond.com to make certain information collected in connection with the registration, renewal or transfer of a domain name, available to the public via an interactive Web page and a "port 43" text-based WHOIS service. This public information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number, as well as the creation and expiration dates of your domain name registration and the nameserver information associated with your domain name, but does not include demographic, financial or Internet usage information. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy we refer to this information collectively as your "WHOIS Information." We do not control how members of the public may use the WHOIS Information.<br>
                <span class="contHiglight">•</span> <span class="contHiglight">Database and Zone Files:</span> Database and Zone Files: We must make certain information about you available to the general public registry database look-up and directory services. When you register or reserve a domain name through us, we will disclose your domain name and its associated Internet Protocol ("IP") numbers (the "zone files") to the applicable domain name registry in order to make your chosen domain name a functional address on the Internet. <br>
                <span class="contHiglight">•</span> <span class="contHiglight">Advertisers:</span> We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.<br>
                <span class="contHiglight">•</span> <span class="contHiglight">Partners:</span> We sometimes partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. It is your responsibility to check the privacy policy of such third parties before submitting any personal information to a partner.<br>
                <span class="contHiglight">•</span> <span class="contHiglight">Agents:</span> We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments, providing marketing assistance, providing customer services, sending postal mail and email to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing data. These persons have access to personal information needed to perform their functions. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information that you provide to NamesBeyond.com for any secondary purposes.<br>
                <span class="contHiglight">•</span> <span class="contHiglight">Service Providers:</span> We engage other companies and individuals to perform enhanced services on our behalf. In addition, certain of our enhanced services such as our Search Engine Optimization services require that we contact Search engines, Internet directories and various search engines on your behalf. Many of our service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.<br>
                <span class="contHiglight">•</span> <span class="contHiglight">Business Transfer:</span> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if NamesBeyond.com or all or substantially all of its assets were ever to be acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.<br>
                <span class="contHiglight">• Compliance:</span> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Services Agreement and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of NamesBeyond, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We may share certain information about you with those who are responsible for handling your account or performing other necessary services that you require. Although we may share sensitive financial information (i.e., credit card numbers, banking information) or security information with such parties where necessary and appropriate, we will not share such information with other third parties, except as required by law, in connection with litigation or arbitration proceedings directly relating to a domain name registration or Services we provide. Please note, however, that, consistent with the current policies for the domain name system, certain information about you must remain available in the publicly accessible registration database.</td>
