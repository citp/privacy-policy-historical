			<h2>AWARENESS</h2>
<p class="bodytext">The          Namibian provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you          aware of our privacy policy, practices and of the choices          you can make about the way your information is collected and          used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available          on our homepage and from the bottom of every page on          <a href="http://www.namibian.com.na" target="_blank">www.namibian.com.na.</a> 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>What          we collect </b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">On some          pages of www.namibian.com.na you can make requests, and          register to receive materials, or become a member of The          Namibian's online community. The types of personal          information collected at these pages are your name, surname,          e-mail address and address details.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">In order          to tailor our subsequent communications to you and          continuously improve our products and services (including          registration), we may also ask you to provide us with          information regarding your personal or professional          interests, demographics, experience with our products, and          more detailed contact preferences. Some electronic          newsletters record anonymous data about articles you have          expressed interest in. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Some          www.namibian.com.na web pages use cookies, a data analysis          technique. To learn more, click here: <a href="privacy/#c285" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">HOW          THE NAMIBIAN USES COOKIES</a>.

<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>How we          use it </b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The          Namibian uses your information to better understand your          needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we          use your information to help you complete a transaction, to          communicate back to you, to update you on service and          benefits, and to personalise our web sites for you.          
</p>
<p class="bodytext">From time          to time, we may also use your information to contact you for          market research or to provide you with marketing information          we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we          will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving          such direct marketing or market research contact.          
</p>
<p class="bodytext">We will          also follow anylocal requirements, such as allowing you to          opt in before receiving unsolicited contact, where          applicable. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Who we          share it with </b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The          Namibian will not sell, rent, or lease your personally          identifiable information to others. Unless we have your          permission or are required by law, we will only share the          personal data you provide online with other entities of The          Namibian and/or business partners who are acting on our          behalf for the uses described in "how we use it".          
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Such          entities and/or business partners, including those in the          Republic of Namibia and/or any other countries, are governed          by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data          and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements.          
</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Children's          Privacy Protection </b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">The          Namibian also takes special care to protect the privacy          needs of children under the age of 13 and encourages parents          to be an active participant in their child's online          activities and interests.

			<h2>CHOICE</h2>
<p class="bodytext">The          Namibian will not use or share the personally identifiable          information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the          ones described above without first letting you know and          offering you a choice.

</p>
<p class="bodytext">Your          permission is always secured first, should we ever share          your information with third parties that are not acting on          our behalf and governed by our privacy policy.

			<h2>ACCURACY &amp; ACCESS</h2>
<p class="bodytext">The          Namibian strives to keep your personally identifiable          information accurate. We will provide you with access to          your information, including making every effort to provide          you with online access to your registration data so that you          may view, update or correct your information at the HP site          where it was submitted. To protect your privacy and          security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your          identity before granting you access or enabling you to make          corrections. To access your personally identifiable          information, return to the web page where you originally          entered it and follow the instructions on that web page.          Certain areas of The Namibian's web site may limit access to          specific individuals through the use of passwords and          through providing personally data. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Links to          third party web sites on the site are provided solely as a          convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave          The Namibian's web site. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">The          Namibian has not reviewed all of these third party sites and          does not control and is not responsible for any of these          sites, their content or their privacy policy. Thus, The          Namibian does not endorse or make any representations about          them, or any information, software or other products or          materials found there, or any results that may be obtained          from using them. If you decide to access any of the third          party sites linked to this site, you do so at your own risk.

			<h2>HOW THE NAMIBIAN USES COOKIES</h2>
<p class="bodytext">A cookie          is a piece of text asking permission to be placed on your          computer's hard drive. If you agree, then your browser adds          the text in a small file. The purpose of a cookie is to help          us analyse web traffic or let us know when you visit a          particular site.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Cookies          allow a web application to respond to you as an individual.          By gathering and remembering information about your          preferences, the web application can tailor its operation to          your needs, likes and dislikes. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">For          example, when you visit an area in The Namibian's online          community, a cookie makes it easy to tell you whether there          are any new messages that you have not          read/accessed.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">The          Namibian uses traffic log cookies to identify what pages are          being used and which ones aren't. This helps us aggregate          and analyse data about web page traffic and make          improvements to www.namibian.com.na to better meet customer          needs.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">In this          case, The Namibian uses this information only for          statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed          from the system. That is the case of many of our support and          information-sharing pages and forums. Denial of a traffic          log cookie should not prevent you from using one of these          sites. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Overall,          cookies help us give you a better web site to use, by          letting us monitor what's working and what isn't through          site traffic analysis. The Namibian wants to be sure you          understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access          to your computer or any personal information about you,          other than the data you chose to share with us. This          practice is strictly enforced. We know that a lot of people          have concerns about cookies, but in talking with many of our          customers, we believe that the benefit we both gain from          their proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships          we have with our customers, so we respect these concerns.          The Namibian works to continuously improve the          www.namibian.com.na web experience and personal data privacy          policy and practices. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">You may          set your web browser (MicroSoft Internet Explorer or          Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement          requests or decline cookies completely. You can delete the          files that contains cookies; those files are stored as part          of your internet browser.
