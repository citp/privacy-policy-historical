It does not govern any other information or communications that may reference Nars. Your use of this website constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes. 

**Non-Personal Identifiable Information**

As with most websites, when you visit the narscosmetics.com, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, which may include information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the internet, the date and time you access the site, the pages you access while at narscosmetics.com, and the internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to the narscosmetics.com. This information is not personally identifiable. 

We may obtain this information by placing a "cookie" on your computer's hard drive so we can recognize you as a return user and personalize your experience. A cookie is a piece of data that enables us to track and target your preferences. The cookie will be stored on your computer's hard drive until you remove it. We may also use temporary or "session" cookies to help you shop. These cookies will expire when you place an order. As with most internet browsers you can erase this information from your computer's hard drive, block all cookies or even receive a warning before a cookie is placed on your system. Click on your Browsers Help button for more information. If you reject our cookies, you may still use the website, but you may be limited in the use of some of the features. Some of our business partners may also use cookies on the website. However, we have no access to, or control over, these cookies and do not accept any responsibility for such use. 

Nars uses non-personally identifiable information for internal business and marketing purposes and to help it administer and improve this website. Nars may also use this information to provide information about this website to its affiliates, advertisers, partners, potential business partners and other unaffiliated entities. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**

Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, social security number, email address or any information you submitted to narscosmetics.com that identifies you individually. 

Personally identifiable information may be collected by Nars if you choose to communicate with Nars through email, via this website, by telephone, in writing, by placing an order, by completing a user registration form or online survey, or by such other means. 

Nars will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it. Therefore, if you do not want Nars to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, please do not provide to Nars any such information. You can visit and browse the Nars website without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself. 

When you submit your personally identifiable information on the website, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

**Use of Personally Identifiable Information**

Nars may use the personally identifiable information collected through its website primarily for such purposes as: helping to establish and verify the identity of users; opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users' accounts or memberships; processing, servicing or enforcing transactions and sending related communications; providing services and support to users; improving the website, including tailoring it to users' preferences; providing users with product or service updates, promotional notices and offers, and other information about Nars and its affiliates; responding to your questions inquiries, comments and instructions; maintaining the security and integrity of its systems. 

**Non-Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information**

Nars does not provide personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties for their use in marketing directly to you without your consent. 

**Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information**

Nars may use unaffiliated companies to help it maintain and operate its website or for other reasons related to the operation of its business, and those companies may receive your personally identifiable information for that purpose. Nars may also disclose personally identifiable information about you in connection with legal requirements, such as in response to an authorized subpoena, governmental request or investigation, or as otherwise permitted by law. Further, as Nars' business develops, it may sell or buy corporate assets, and in such transactions customer information will be shared with such third parties and may be one of the transferred business assets. 

**Children Under 13**

This website is directed toward and designed for use by persons aged 13 or older. Nars will not approve applications of, or establish or maintain accounts or memberships for, any child whom Nars knows to be under the age of 13. Nars does not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If Nars nevertheless discovers that it has received personally identifiable information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or whom Nars otherwise has reason to believe is, under the age of 13, Nars will delete such information from its systems. Additionally, a child's parent or legal guardian may request that the child's information be corrected or deleted from Nars' files by contacting us at [customerservice@narscosmetics.com](mailto:customerservice@narscosmetics.com).
