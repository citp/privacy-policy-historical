## What Our Privacy Policy Covers

This Privacy Policy covers any personal information that NARS obtains from you when you visit the website.   You may be accessing this site from a computer or mobile device (through a smartphone or tablet application, for example), and this policy governs your use of the site regardless of the means of access.

Our Privacy Policy may change in the future.  The Effective Date is posted at the top and we will post notice of changes.  We invite you to check back periodically to see if we have made any changes.   If we make any material changes (such as substantially new practices you would wouldn’t expect from us or uses of your information that we did not previously tell you about), we will post a notice on our home page and will obtain your consent to such changes if those material changes affect the way we use the personally identifiable information we have already collected from you.   By using the NARS website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.   If you do not agree, you should not use the site.  For more information about the terms of use for this site, please visit our [Terms of Use](http://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/terms.html) page.

## Personally Identifiable Information

Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, social security number, email address or any information you submitted to NARScosmetics.com that identifies you individually.

Personally identifiable information may be collected by NARS if you choose to communicate with NARS through email, via this website, by telephone, in writing, by placing an order, by completing a user registration form or online survey, or by such other means.

NARS will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it. Therefore, if you do not want NARS to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, please do not provide to NARS any such information. You can visit and browse the NARS website without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself.

When you submit your personally identifiable information on the website, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

## Use of Personally Identifiable Information

NARS may use the personally identifiable information collected through its website primarily for such purposes as: helping to establish and verify the identity of users; opening, maintaining, administering and servicing users’ accounts or memberships; processing, servicing or enforcing transactions and sending related communications; providing services and support to users; improving the website, including tailoring it to users’ preferences; providing users with product or service updates, promotional notices and offers, and other information about NARS and its affiliates; responding to your questions inquiries, comments and instructions; maintaining the security and integrity of its systems.

## Personal Information We May Share

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, NARS does not provide personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties for their use in marketing directly to you without your consent.  We may share your personal information with:

  * Our corporate affiliates.  For additional information regarding our corporate affiliates, please see [www.shiseidogroup.com](http://www.shiseidogroup.com/)
  * Third party services providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions and are contractually obligated to protect your information.   We do not authorize these service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.   These services can include hosting and maintenance services, analysis services, e-mail messaging services, delivery services, order fulfillment, handling of payment transactions, etc.  
  * Other third parties with your consent (for example, our Facebook page may share information collected through those apps with your Facebook friends or other Facebook users according to your settings).
  * Administration of a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway, competition, or other similar marketing campaign or promotion. These events typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (for prize fulfillment), limited demographic information (for eligibility), and, in some cases, customer-generated content. Some promotions with customer-generated content or a social networking component will be run on third party social networks such as Facebook (e.g., on NARS’ Facebook fan page or application). To comply with sweepstakes laws, we may publish or share limited information about promotion winners (such as name and city of residence). For more information about our contests and other promotions, please see the official rules or details posted with each promotion.



In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.

We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.   Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

We may use information collected through certain automated means described below for market research, data analytics, and system administration purposes, such as to determine whether you have visited our site before or are new to the site, to tailor ads displayed to you on our site and elsewhere and for compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures, including the enforcement of our Terms of Use.
