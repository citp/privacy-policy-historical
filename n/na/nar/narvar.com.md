# Privacy Policy | Narvar

#### Narvar Privacy Policy

#### Last Updated: June 25, 2019

#### Welcome to our website (the “ **Site** ”). Narvar, Inc. (“ **Narvar** ”) offers a software as a service platform to Customers that have contracted with Narvar to help manage and improve consumers’ post-purchase experience, including order tracking, delivery notifications, management of product returns and customer support (“ **Services** ”).

#### This Privacy Policy describes how Narvar collects, uses, shares and secures the personal data you provide through your use of the Services and our Site. It also describes your choices regarding your personal data. While providing our Services to Customers, we may receive information related to our Customers’ consumers and other third parties. Our use of information on behalf of our Customers is governed by our contract with Customers and the Customer’s own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or privacy practices of Customers or other third parties.

#### Narvar complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks (“ **Frameworks** ”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the processing of personal data transferred from the European Union (“ **EU** ”) and Switzerland to the U.S., respectively (for these purposes, reference to the EU also includes the European Economic Area countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Narvar has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (described below). If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks and to view our certification page, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list).

#### By using the Site and/or the Services and providing us with your personal data, you agree to the processing of your personal data in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.

#### _01_

#### **Personal Data Collected**

#### When you interact with the Site or the Services, we may collect information that, alone or in combination with other information, could be used to identify you (“ **Personal Data** ”), as described below:

#### **1.1** _Personal Data Provided Through The Site or Services._ We collect Personal Data from you when you create an account, use or order products or services, request information (including a demo), ask to download content (such as a white paper or an e-book), communicate with customer service, or subscribe to emailing lists. The types of Personal Data that we collect vary based on your request, but generally include:

  * First and last name
  * Job title
  * Company name
  * Email address
  * Phone number
  * Mailing address
  * Narvar account password
  * Payment and billing information
  * Country location



#### When you sign up for our blog, we collect your email address. If you choose to receive promotional emails from us, we will also collect your email subscription preferences.

#### **1.2** _Personal Data Obtained From Other Sources._ We may supplement the information that we collected from you (such as your email address) with additional information about you and your company obtained from publicly available and third-party databases or services that provide information about business people and companies (including an individual’s name, job title, business contact information, and company information). This helps us update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.

#### **1.3** _Personal Data We Collect On Behalf Of Customers._ In providing the Services to Customers, we process on behalf of our Customers Personal Data about consumers who make a purchase for product or services on our Customers’ websites, mobile applications or other services, that our Customers or their consumers input or upload into our Services.

#### For example, when consumers make a purchase from one of our Customers and are the recipient of a package, they may have been provided a link to a Narvar’s tracking page in order to check the status of an order. When Customers use our shipping and order tracking, alert, or return Services, we receive name, order, and shipping information from a carrier or one of our Customers. When consumers visit our Site to track a package in transit or process a return, we collect information relating to visits to the Site, as we do with other Site visitors (for further information, please see the “Automatically Collected Data” section below).

#### Our Services allow Customers to ensure that their consumers can obtain information about their orders via SMS. In this case, we will use phone number and other information submitted to us to provide the text messages associated with the SMS service.

#### Our Services also allow Customers to ensure that their consumers can obtain information about their orders via social media platforms such as Facebook Messenger (“ **Social Media Sites** ”). When consumers elect to receive this information and interact with Narvar’s chatbot on Narvar’s or the Social Media Sites (for example, they inquiry about estimated delivery date), we receive from Facebook and process on behalf of our Customers consumer’s publicly available social media profile information (including name, “locale”, and gender). Information shared with Social Media Sites will be governed by the specific privacy policies and terms of service of the Social Media Sites and not by this Privacy Policy.

#### When providing the Services to our Customers, sometimes it is necessary to obtain Personal Data about consumers from publicly accessible sources (such as carriers like the United States Postal Service that match address information) or from third parties in order to ensure fulfillment of orders. We will combine this data with information we already collected on behalf of our Customers. For example, we may obtain information on consumers’ address from retailers or shipping companies to verify the address and contact information so we can properly provide information about package status.

#### **1.4** _Automatically Collected Data._ When you visit the Site, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the Site. Please see also the “Use of cookies” section below to learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies. We also collect information on the country you are connecting from based on your IP address at the time you visit the Site.
