    dpo@ecctis.co.uk; by telephone on +44 3003 038777; or by post at 68-70 Suffolk
    Road, Cheltenham, GL50 2ED, United Kingdom.
6.2 Our use of your personal data will always have a lawful basis; this may be contract,
    because it is necessary to process your data for Our performance of a contract with
    you; or consent, because you have consented to Our use of your personal data (e.g.
    by consenting to marketing emails); or legitimate interest, because processing your
    data is in the legitimate interests of Ecctis Ltd and/or its operational entities (e.g. by
    archiving international qualification certificates as a reference source for the purposes
    of checking, training, and fraud prevention).
    Specifically, We may use your data for the following purposes:
    6.2.1    supplying Our products and services to you (note that We require your
             personal data in order to enter into a contract with you, and We cannot supply

    6.2.2    personalising and tailoring Our products and services for you;
    6.2.3    responding to emails/messages from you;
    6.2.4    sending you emails from time to time, with relevant information, and feedback
             surveys about Our service to you, and research surveys finding out about your
             experiences of applying for study or work in the UK and your perceptions of
             the UK – you can opt out of receiving these emails by entering your email
             address here or by unsubscribing using the links provided in Our emails.
    6.2.5    For Our organisational members and individual users of Our services for
             organisations, the above also applies.
6.3 The lawful bases that We use to process personal data are:
    Contract – for performing qualification and skills evaluation and statement services for
    individuals; or for performing services for organisations or individual users of Our
    services for organisations;
    Consent – for communications with you which have direct marketing purposes (this is
    for informing you about Our related services that may be of interest to you; We do not
    spam you and We do not sell your data to other organisations);
    Legitimate interest – for retaining copies of qualification certificates and transcripts
    as a reference source for the purposes of checking and training and for prevention of
    education fraud; and for communicating with you to give you relevant information or to
    survey you – about your customer experience with Us or to research your experiences
    of applying for study or work in the UK and your perceptions of the UK.
6.4 Data will be retained for the following periods:
    6.4.1    Personal data used for the provision of qualification and skills evaluation and
             statement services for individuals will be retained for a period of 25 years after
             the completion of the service to the individual. For the purposes of the
             prevention of fraud, UK NARIC is sometimes requested to verify statements
                                          4
                                                                                            V18.5.2


             that it has issued. To enable cross-checking and verification to take place, it is
             necessary to retain personal data in Our systems for a period of time.
             Many individuals using Our services do so to enter UK study or work and in
             order to find out more about your experiences of this as you go through
             courses of study or employment, We may from time to time send you
             research surveys during this period. Your personal data will be deleted after
             the period of time stated above. If you wish your personal data to be deleted
             before the expiry of this time period, you can request this by emailing
             dpo@ecctis.co.uk or using the contact details in Section 13. Note that if you
             do this, We will be unable to verify your UK NARIC statements if asked to do
             so by educational institutions, employers, government authorities or other
             agencies.
    6.4.2    Electronic copies of qualification certificates, transcripts, and related
             qualification documents submitted with applications, will be deleted from Our
             application database 12 months after the completion of the service to the
             individual and Our last communication with you. Passport biographical data
             and/or National ID card data for services requiring Primary Source Verification
             will be deleted as soon as PSV processing has been completed.
             However, We may choose to retain electronic copies of your qualification
             certificates and transcripts as part of an archive of qualification documents for
             checking and training purposes, and as an important aid in the prevention of
             education fraud. In these cases, the certificates will be retained in a secure
             section of Our server, for the duration for which the certificates are required. If
             you do not wish your qualification documents to be used in this way, please
             tell Us; by email at dpo@ecctis.co.uk; or by using the contact details in
             Section 13.
    6.4.3    Personal data provided to Us by Our member organisations for evaluation
             purposes, e.g. qualification documents bearing names submitted as part of a
             member enquiry, will be retained for a period of 5 years. This will assist
             organisations in demonstrating compliance with Government, regulatory and
             best practice requirements.
    6.4.4    Personal data which may be provided to Us by telephone may be recorded by
             Our system. This data will be retained for a period of 6 months.
    6.4.5    For Our organisational member services, personal data relating to system
             users, maintained by members themselves, will be retained for a period of 6
             months after the user is deactivated.
    6.4.6    For Our organisational members, and individual users of Our services for
             organisations who are using Our training services or who are attending Our
             training/events/conferences, We will retain data relating to training and
             development activities undertaken and events/conferences attended for a
             period of 3 years. This will assist in maintaining Records of Personal
             Development.
6.5 You have the right at any time to request that We stop using your personal data, and
    to request that We delete it. Note that if you do this before We have completed a
    service to you, We will be unable to complete that service for you; and that We will be
    unable to communicate with you after your personal data is deleted.
                                          5
                                                                                          V18.5.2


   6.6   If unsolicited personal or sensitive personal data is sent to Us, in any form, We will not
         retain the data and We will delete it.

         services involving Primary Source Verification) your data will be stored in the UK in

         use a range of selected companies and organisations in different parts of the world.
         Some of these companies and organisations will process your data outside of the

         consent for this at the time of ordering services requiring Primary Source Verification,
         and provided with details of the specific companies and organisations. All such
         arrangements with verification companies and organisations are governed by
         appropriate agreements and contracts.
   7.3   Data security is very important to us, and to protect your data we have taken suitable
         measures to safeguard and secure personal data collected through our site.

                  secure and sensitive manner.

         explicit consent.

         qualification verification has to deal with different kinds of institutions worldwide, We
         use a range of selected companies and organisations in different parts of the world.

         General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You will be asked to give specific
         consent for this at the time of ordering services requiring Primary Source Verification.
         All such arrangements with verification companies and organisations are governed by
         appropriate agreements and contracts.

         entered into Worldpay’s secure payment portal. Your payment details are not stored in

    8.4      We may record and compile statistics about the use of Our Site including data on
             traffic, usage patterns, user numbers, sales, and other information. All such data will
             be anonymised when compiled and will not include any personally identifying data, or
             any anonymised data that can be combined with other data to identify you. We may
             from time to time share such anonymised statistical data with third parties, including
             HM Government for the purposes of Our reporting and accountability. Data will be
             shared and used in this way within the bounds of the law.

             which may include your personal data, for example, where We are involved in legal

             you have provided will, where it is relevant to any part of Our business that is being
             transferred, be transferred along with that part and the new owner or newly controlling
             party will, under the terms of this privacy policy, be permitted to use that data only for
             the same purposes for which it was originally collected by Us.

    10.1     In addition to your rights under the GDPR, set out in section 4, when you submit
             personal data via Our Site, you may be given options to restrict Our use of your data.
             In particular, we aim to give you control on Our use of your data for direct marketing
             purposes and there is a separate opt-in for these purposes. You also have the ability
             to opt-out of receiving informational, survey and other emails from Us, by
