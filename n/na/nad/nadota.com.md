Welcome to Teespring! Teespring is a global company offering an internet-based service (the **“Teespring Service”** ) that allows campaign creators ( **“sellers”** ) to design certain products and promote the sale of those products to consumers ( **“buyers”** ) around the world through individual campaigns. This Privacy Policy applies to the Teespring Service, operated by Teespring, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, **“Teespring”** ), and located at teespring.com (and other regional URLs).

This Privacy Policy describes how Teespring collects and uses the information we obtain when you use the Teespring Service. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and manage that information. This Privacy Policy is part of and is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/policies/terms), which you accept in order to transact with us. Your acceptance of this Privacy Policy includes your consent to our use of cookies and other similar technologies as described in this document.

To note, our site may include links to other web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Teespring. Because the use of your information is governed by their privacy policies, we encourage you to read each policy carefully. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of any third party website or service.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.

 **Information You Provide to Us. “Personal Information”** means information that alone or in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you. The Personal Information we collect will be different depending on your activities on the Teespring Service. For example, to register as a seller on our service, we will collect your name and email address. If you register using a sign-in service or a social media platform such as Facebook, we will collect the information needed to authenticate your account and any other information the platform provides in that process. If you launch a successful campaign, we may collect additional Personal Information as needed to send you and the applicable tax authorities an income tax reporting statement. If you make a purchase through the Teespring Service, we will collect your name, email address, shipping address and payment information such as credit card number and billing address.

We may also collect Personal Information you provide about other people, such as their name and physical address (for example, when we ship a gift at your request). This Personal Information is used for the sole purpose of completing your request.

 **Automated Technologies. “Site Information”** means information received and recorded on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser type, the date and time of the use, the pages you visit, the page you came from and go to when leaving the Teespring Service, your operating system and information about your mobile device. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. In addition, we also automatically collect Site Information when you access or use the Teespring Service. We (and our vendors) collect that information using cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, embedded web links, and similar technologies. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our service may be limited.

We Teespring and our partners use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We also use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication and other similar services. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our service may be limited.

 **Teespring Tools. “Performance Information”** means information we collect through certain tools that we provide to our sellers. Where a seller requests the use of a particular tool (e.g. an advertising analytics tool for use with ad platforms), then Teespring will collect additional data based on the operation of that tool (e.g. advertising conversion information from the applicable ad platform).

 **Blog.** The Teespring Service may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [privacy@teespring.com](mailto:privacy@teespring.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

 **Social Media Widgets.** The Teespring Service may include social media features, such as the Facebook like button and share buttons. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly. Certain social media features are hosted by the applicable provider (e.g. Facebook). Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the features.

 **Single Sign-On.** You can log into the Teespring Service using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on the Teespring Service to your profile page to share with others within your network.

In general, we use Personal Information to provide the Teespring Service to you, including, to establish and administer your account, to fulfill your order and send you an order confirmation, to pay you any royalties earned and to respond to customer service requests.

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at [privacy@teespring.com](mailto:privacy@teespring.com). You may not opt-out of the transactional emails Teespring sends in connection with your use of the Teespring Service (e.g. email notification of individual account activity, such as shipment of an order, or broader account notifications such as changes to Teespring’s policies).

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/).

We use Performance Information to analyze and better understand the characteristics of successful offerings and campaigns and to improve the performance of our sellers and the overall Teespring Service.

Teespring does not collect Personal Information about your online activities over time, across different web sites. Accordingly, Teespring does not currently respond to “do not track” browser requests.

 **Vendors and Service Providers.** To provide you with the Teespring Service, we share information, including Personal Information, with third party vendors and service providers. For example, we provide Personal Information to companies that help us with our business activities, such as marketing, payment processing and fulfillment. We will use reasonable efforts to ensure those companies use your Personal Information only as necessary.

 **As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures.** In certain situations, Teespring may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting law enforcement requirements. We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to comply with law enforcement requests, such as a court order or subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others. Specifically, we may disclose your information to a complainant who alleges that your activities have violated their rights or policies (e.g. where your campaign or advertisement is the subject of an investigation). We may also disclose your information where you have alleged violation of your rights by another party.

 **Merger, Sale or Other Asset Transfers.** If Teespring is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information.

We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

This includes the companies who handle our order dispatch service and our delivery company. We will only provide these companies with the information which they need to carry out their jobs. They will only be allowed to use your information in the way in which we tell them, and they will not be entitled to use it in their own right. We may on occasion notify you by email about changes to our terms and conditions, or other important changes to our website or our service. In assessing your request for goods or services, we may use your information for the purposes of the prevention and detection of fraud. We may disclose your address and postcode details to check against any other Fraud Prevention Scheme. If you believe your details are incorrect you may correct those details by following the procedure below. We will not pass your information to any third parties except where required to do so as a part of the sale, disposal or transfer of our business, in whole or in part.

 **International Transfers.** If we are required to transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we will ensure adequate of protection and security by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
  * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.



 **Your Legal Rights.** Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include: 

**Rights** | **What This Means**  
---|---  
Access personal data | **Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.  
Correct personal data | **Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.  
Erase personal data | **Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.  
Object to processing of personal data | **Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.  
Restrict processing of personal data | **Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:  
(a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;  
(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;  
(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or   
(d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.  
Transfer personal data | **Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.  
Withdraw consent | **Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.  
  
Teespring may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that will be posted on our website (teespring.com) or communicated to you through other reasonable means (e.g. email or mobile alerts). We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
