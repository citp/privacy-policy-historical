        <h2>6. POLICY</h2>
        <h3>6.1 Personal Information</h3>
        <div class="sub_section">
            <h4>6.1.1 When Information is Collected</h4>
            <p>The state does not collect or retain personally identifiable information unless a person voluntarily:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Participates in an activity that asks for information (i.e. sending an email, participating in a survey or filling in an online form). This information will only be used to respond to the person’s request and to analyze trends. A message may be redirected to another government agency or person who is in a better position to respond.</li>
                <li>Uses an online service or transaction that requires collection of personally identifiable information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Choosing not to participate in an activity or service that requests personal information will in no way effect a visitor’s ability to access any other feature of the State of Nevada website.</p>
            <p>If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once it is provided, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.</p>
            <h4>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 2001</h4>
            <p> Nevada websites directed to children under 13, that knowingly collect information from children, must comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 2001. However, visitors are cautioned that the state has no way of determining the age of a person volunteering personally identifiable information online or by email. As such, this information will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access. </p>
            <h4>6.1.3 Password Information</h4>
            <p> User names and passwords or PINs may be required to access an online service offered by a Nevada state executive branch organization. No representative of the state of Nevada will ever request a user to reveal their username, password or PIN. Under no circumstances should this information be shared with or disclosed to any other person. However, online systems may offer the built-in capability to securely assist users who have lost or forgotten their PIN or password. </p>
            <h4>6.1.4 Correcting Personal Information</h4>
            <p> Unless otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, rule or regulation, an individual may request correction of personally identifiable information. Persons concerned about information contained in their personal records should contact the custodian of that record, which is typically the organization that has collected the information </p>
            <h4>6.1.5 Public Disclosure of Information</h4>
            <p>It is important to understand that under applicable state and federal law, various forms of correspondence and other communications may be subject to public disclosure. </p>
