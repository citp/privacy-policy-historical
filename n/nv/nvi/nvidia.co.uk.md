#### 1\. Introduction

NVIDIA® is committed to implementing appropriate protections for any Personal Information that our users share with us.

NVIDIA's Online Privacy Policy and [Kids Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/object/privacy-policy-children-uk.html) set forth our policies and procedures regarding our collection, use, and/or sharing of your Personal Information.

#### 2\. What Information We May Collect

When users visit our website or mobile apps, we may collect **"Personal information,"** which is any information that can be used to identify a particular individual, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or other contact information. In addition, we may collect information about your visits to our websites, including the pages you view, the links and ads you click, search terms you enter, and other actions you take in connection with NVIDIA websites. We may also collect certain information from the browser you used to come to our website, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, access times, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the website that referred you to our website and to which URL you browse away from our site if you click on a link on our site. When other non-public information, such as product preferences, hobbies or browsing history, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, that other information is treated as Personal Information.

We collect Personal Information about our users in several ways.

**Personal Information You Provide to Us**

Most of the Personal Information we receive comes to us voluntarily from our users who are interested in obtaining products and services from us. For example, Personal Information may be collected when you:

  * Register or log on to our website;
  * Participate in activities on our website, such as a sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers;
  * Sign up for a newsletter;
  * Provide information to our customer service representatives;
  * Use our message boards and other public forums on our website;
  * Apply for employment online; and
  * Purchase cool stuff from NVIDIA's Online Store.



**Personal Information Collected Via Technology**

As you navigate our website or mobile apps, our information technology (IT) systems may collect passive information, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, device type, device ID, geolocation data and operating system. We also use cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information on the date and time of your visit, the products you reviewed, and the areas of our site you visited. This information allows us to better understand our users and to enhance your experience. For example, when you return to our website after visiting another site, cookies allow our website to remember who you are. (Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.) In addition, collecting information such as device type allows us to optimize settings for your system remotely.

The information collected passively through our IT systems is not personally identifiable on its own. However, we may combine that information with other personally identifiable information to better serve you.

**Personal Information We Receive From Others**

We may receive Personal Information about users from other sources, such as web analytics vendors and marketing consultants. This information supplements any information that we have collected directly from our users, and allows us to customize our website and products to better serve you. Sometimes, we may receive Personal Information about people who are not yet users of our website. NVIDIA's policy is to treat all information obtained from third parties in the same manner that we treat information that we have collected ourselves.

#### 3\. Why We Collect Personal Information

The Personal Information we collect helps us process transactions, respond to requests, and learn about our users' interests in terms of the features, performance and support of our products, and our users' website experience. We also use this information to send newsletters or promotional e-mails regarding new or upgraded products and services. (Please see the section below on **Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information**.)

We do not sell Personal Information about our customers or website users to any third parties. We may from time to time share your Personal Information with our business partners, resellers, affiliates, or consulting partners in an effort to better serve you. For example, when you register for a marketing event or contest on our website, we may share your Personal Information with the business partners that help us run the event or contest.

Any Personal Information we collect may be shared with NVIDIA's corporate affiliates, or companies who operate under the same corporate control. NVIDIA will take reasonable steps to ensure that these companies affiliates honor this Online Privacy Policy and Kids Privacy Policy. 

We may, from time to time, share your Personal Information with business partners that help us with our design, manufacturing, integration, delivery, support, payment, and servicing processes. NVIDIA's policy is to prohibit these companies from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide the services expressly requested by NVIDIA.

We may disclose your Personal Information to our e-mail marketing partners, if you choose to receive promotional communications from us. You should contact these partners directly if you have any questions regarding how these partners treat your personal information. 

NVIDIA may sell or buy assets from or to other companies. Personal information may be one of the transferred business assets, and would likely be one of the transferred assets in the event that NVIDIA or substantially all of its assets were acquired. If NVIDIA or its assets are acquired by another company, NVIDIA will take all reasonable measures to ensure that the acquiring company assumes the obligations of this Online Privacy Policy and Kids Privacy Policy.

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on NVIDIA; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of NVIDIA or users of our website. 

NVIDIA may "de-personalize" Personal Information by removing personally identifiable characteristics, such as name and email address, and aggregate data for use in surveys or other business purposes. NVIDIA may then use and/or share this de-personalized information with third parties.

#### 4\. Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information

NVIDIA respects your choices about how your Personal Information is used when you register with us, elect to receive our newsletters, or provide us with Personal Information for other purposes.

  * If you choose _not_ to provide any Personal Information when requested on the website, you can still enjoy most areas on the website. However, you may be unable to access certain areas and services that require our interaction with you.
  * If you choose to provide NVIDIA with your Personal Information, you can **"opt-in"** to also receive additional communications from NVIDIA, our affiliates or our business partners, such as newsletters, promotional materials, special offers, etc.
  * You can **"opt-out"** of receiving further communications at any time by unsubscribing at <http://www.nvidia.com/nvregister/frmOptOut.asp>, or by following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any e-mail you receive. We will alert our e-mail marketing partners to stop sending you any further NVIDIA-related communications. However, we may still send you updates to our Legal Notices, Online Privacy Policy, or regarding any account you have created with us.
