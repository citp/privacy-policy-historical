# Privacy Policy

NVIDIA gathers certain information from and about visitors to our website.  We pay close attention to how information about our visitors is used and shared, and we use that information carefully and sensibly.  This notice describes our privacy policy.  **By visiting NVIDIA's website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.**

**Information Gathered by NVIDIA**  
The information we gather from visitors to our website helps us learn about end-users and potential end-users of our products so that we can better tailor product features, performance and support, and offer additional information and opportunities. 

We collect information you enter on our website, such as when you search for products or participate in a contest or questionnaire.  We may also  collect information you provide to us in other ways, such as when you communicate with us by telephone or e-mail.  Information collected may include your name, address, phone number, details of purchases, personal preferences, financial information, and other descriptive information. 

We may also gather certain information automatically whenever you interact with our website.  Like many websites, we may use "cookies" (alphanumeric files transferred to your computer hard drive that enable our computers to recognize your computer) that allow us to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our website.  Information collected may include the Internet Protocol address used to connect you to the Internet, computer information such as browser type and operating system, the Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to, through, and from our website, date and time of your visit, products and information you viewed or searched for, phone numbers used to call us, and confirmation of when you open e-mail from us.

To help improve our products and to provide services such as product recommendations and special offers, we may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to information we have collected.

 **Use of Information**  
We use the information that you provide to improve our products, respond to your requests, deliver product information (such as notification of product releases and the availability of updated software drivers and technical information), and make you aware of special offers. 

We are not in the business of selling information about our customers or visitors to our website.  We may, however, share information with select partners working with us to deliver better graphics and multimedia capabilities.  We work with other companies throughout the design, manufacturing, integration, delivery, support, and servicing process, and may provide information we have collected to them to assist in improving their processes and so that they too can offer you useful information and special offers. 

NVIDIA may sell or buy assets from or to other companies.  Customer information may be one of the transferred business assets, and would likely be one of the transferred assets in the unlikely event that NVIDIA or substantially all of its assets were acquired.

We may release information on customers and visitors to our website when we believe release is appropriate to comply with laws, to enforce or apply our terms of use or terms of agreements we have entered into, or to protect our rights and property. 

**Conditions of Use and Revisions  
** If you choose to visit NVIDIA’s website, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Notice, as governed by the laws of the State of California.  This Privacy Notice may change periodically, and use of information that we have gathered is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use.  You should check our website frequently to see recent changes.
