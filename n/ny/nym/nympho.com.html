This privacy statement covers the site <a href="http://www.nympho.com">Nympho.com</a> 
Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it 
has agreed to disclose its information practices. If you have questions or concerns 
regarding this statement, you should contact our <a href="mailto:support@nympho.com?subject=Nympho Mega Site">Privacy 
Department</a>.<br>
<br>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>What This Privacy Policy Covers</strong></font><br>
  This policy covers how Nympho.com treats personal information and e-mail addresses 
  that Nympho.com collects and receives. The only personal information we collect 
  is your e-mail address. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies 
  that Nympho.com does not own or control or to people that Nympho.com does not 
  employ or manage.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#000000"><strong>General</strong></font> <br>
  Nympho.com only collects and stores your e-mail address when you register for 
  Nympho.com membership access and the Nympho.com blacklist. We do not collect 
  your e-mail address under any other circumstances. Nympho.com automatically 
  receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including 
  your IP address, Nympho.com cookie information, and the page you request. <br>
  • Except in emergencies dealing with fraud, we do not connect this general internet 
  traffic data with your specific e-mail address. Nympho.com uses information 
  for the following general purposes: <br>
• Your e-mail address is used to contact 
  you on a transactional basis. More specifically, we will send you an e-mail 
  when you sign up for your membership, choose to cancel it, or request that your 
  password be sent to you in case you have forgotten it. <br>
  • Your e-mail address is used to send you our newsletter featuring website 
  updates. Nympho.com does not rent, sell, or share your personal information 
  or e-mail address with any third-parties. The only persons with access to your 
  e-mail address are trusted high-level Nympho.com employees.<br>
  •We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information 
  or email address as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary 
  to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, 
  or legal process served on our Web site.<br>
  •We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, 
  prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations 
  involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations 
  of Nympho.com's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.<br>
  •We transfer information about you if Nympho.com is acquired by or merged 
  with another company. In this event, Nympho.com will notify you before information 
  about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.<br>
  This privacy statement covers the website Nympho.com and all pages on its domain 
  name. When you click a link or otherwise leave this domain, our privacy policy 
  will no longer apply. Our website may participate in co-branding agreements 
  which use the Nympho.com brand name, domain name, or the general "look 
  and feel" of our site to work with another company. In these cases, your 
  personally identifiable information will NOT be shared with our co-branding 
  partners. Our privacy policy will not be applicable in such cases; however, 
  we will require that our partners post their own company name and privacy policy 
  on any co-branded site.</p>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Cookies</strong></font><br>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping 
purposes. We may use cookies on this site but we do NOT link the information we 
store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on 
our site. We use only session ID cookies which make it easier for you to navigate 
our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. We do NOT use 
persistent cookies which remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. 
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but you may have to re-enter 
your username and password more often and you may experience some other unexpected 
browsing inconveniences. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Nympho.com's cookies. <br><br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Your Ability to Access, Edit and Delete Your Personal 
Information and E-mail Address</strong></font><br>
As part of your membership, you are required to keep a current e-mail address 
on file with Nympho.com where we may send you transaction-based e-mails as well 
as our newsletter. If at any time you wish to unsubscribe from receiving our e-mails, 
you must delete your account with Nympho.com by emailing <a href="mailto:support@nympho.com">support@nympho.com</a>, you 
will receive one final e-mail confirmation that your account has been deleted 
and you will never be contacted again for any reason. If you have any further questions about your personally identifiable information 
or email address changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may contact 
us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:support@nympho.com">support@nympho.com</a>.<br>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><strong>Confidentiality and Security</strong></font> <br>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information 
and e-mail addresses submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive 
it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, 
is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable 
means to protect your personal information and e-mail address, we cannot guarantee 
its absolute security. We limit access to your personal information and e-mail 
address to employees whom we believe reasonably need to come into contact with 
that information.<br>
<br>
<strong><font color="#000000">Minors</font></strong><br>
Nympho.com is an adult site and access to persons under the age of 18 is strictly 
prohibited. Nympho.com has no intention of collecting any personally-identifiable 
information from individuals under eighteen years of age. Nympho.com specifically 
instructs minors not to submit such information on our website. If a minor has 
provided us with personally-identifiable information, a parent or guardian of 
that minor should contact us using the contact form listed on these pages and 
we will remove this information from our existing files.<br>
<br>
<strong><font color="#000000">Changes to this Privacy Policy</font></strong><br>
Nympho.com may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes 
in the way we treat personal information or e-mail addresses by sending a notice 
to the primary email address specified in your Nympho.com account or by placing 
a prominent notice on our site.<br>
<br>
<strong><font color="#000000">Changes in E-Mail Practices</font></strong> <br>
If we decide to make changes in our email practices, we will post those changes 
  to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate 
  so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
  what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we make material changes to the 
  way we use your email address, we will notify you here, by email, or by means 
  of a notice on our home page.<br>
