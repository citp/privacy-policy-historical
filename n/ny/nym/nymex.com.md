# Privacy Policy

Effective as of November 2nd, 2018

## Purpose and Scope

CME Group Inc. and each of its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively known as "CME Group") are committed to safeguarding your personal information. We have adopted and implemented this privacy policy ("Policy") as part of our commitment to protecting your personal information across all of our services. We encourage you to read this Policy to learn more about the ways we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information. 

Because we are a global company, this Policy takes into consideration various privacy regulations and frameworks for protecting the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, and disposition of personal information in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  Additional details relating to the European Union (EU) or, respectively, European Economic Area (EEA) (collectively, “ **EU/EEA** ”), United States, countries or other jurisdictions are provided in the body of this Policy as well as at the end of the Policy in the "Country- and State-Specific Notices" section. 

Unless superseded by alternative Terms and Conditions (e.g. customer agreements, employee contracts) where appropriate, when you provide CME Group with personal information, the method by which the information will be collected, used, distributed, and maintained will be in accordance with the terms outlined in this Policy.

By providing personal information and using our products and services you acknowledge the collection, use, distribution and maintenance of your personal information in the manner described in this Policy or the alternative Terms and Conditions under which the collection of the information applies. If you object to any aspect of this Policy or alternative Terms and Conditions, CME Group asks that you do not submit your personal information or utilize our services. 

## Consent

Where required by law, we generally will seek your express written or oral consent for the collection, use, maintenance and distribution of your personal information. 

There are situations where consent may not be sought as we are legally permitted under applicable laws to process personal information without consent.  For example, depending on the applicable jurisdiction, this may include situations where;

  * the processing of personal information is required by law (e.g. subpoena);
  * the processing of personal information is required in order for CME Group to fulfill its legal and regulatory obligations;
  * the processing of personal information is necessary as part of the provision and receipt of our products and services;
  * information is used in the aggregate to improve our products and services;
  * in response to an emergency or where the safety or health of an individual or the public is at risk; or
  * the information is publicly available.  



##   
Changes to the Privacy Policy

The Policy is current as of the effective date set forth above. The Policy is reviewed regularly and may change over time.  All modifications are effective immediately, where permitted by law. Therefore, we encourage you to review this Policy periodically so you are aware of our practices.  If we make material changes to the Policy by modifying our privacy practices that increase our rights to use personal information we have previously collected about you, we may attempt to notify you or obtain your consent, where required by law, either through your registered email address or by prominent posting on this page with an appended revision date. 

## Information Collection

CME Group recognizes that personal information is considered to be any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.  CME Group may collect personal information directly from you and, in some circumstances, from those individuals and/or entities you may authorize to act on your behalf and, where permissible by applicable laws, from publicly available sources.

The type of information you may be requested to provide will vary based upon the type of relationship(s) you have established with CME Group. 

Most commonly, we collect your full name, professional job title, physical address, phone number, and your email address in order to provide you with services tailored to your particular needs.  In connection with some of our products and services we may collect additional types of personal information including, but not limited to, full name, phone number, email, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, Social Security Number, Financial Account Information, country of origin, etc. Please refer to the sections below or to the forms where we collect information from you for details.

CME Group may collect personal information relevant to the purposes of administering its business, providing and improving its products and services, such as in relation to:

**USE OF OUR WEBSITES ("SITES"):**  In order to better serve your particular needs, CME Group (and third parties operating on CME Group’s behalf) may collect information from or about you while visiting the Sites. Some of this information is collected automatically through cookies (see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy.html)) and when using your log-in credentials. CME Group may also obtain information directly from you and, depending upon the nature of transactions you may conduct, from third party sources.

From time to time, CME Group may seek to collect input from you about the use of our Sites, products or services.  This information may be collected with or without the collection of identifying information.  If we request personal information, these fields will be optional, unless otherwise indicated, resulting in you having control over whether or not the answers remain anonymous. Third party tools may be used to facilitate these questionnaires.

We also collect non-personal (pseudonymized and anonymized) information when you visit CME Group Sites. This information includes, but is not limited to, the pages you view, the search terms entered into the search utility, location, the operating system, browser software, preferred language and internet service provider you use.  Such non-personal information we may collect generally is used to administer the Site, improve our services, determine how the Sites are being used, identify popular areas of the Sites, analyze trends and usage patterns, and offer you tailored content. If we associate your non-personal information with your personal information, we will generally treat everything as personal information.

Additionally, as permitted by law and regulation, your information may be used in aggregate, statistical form to track and measure usage including, but not limited to, customer/user preferences, interests, demographics, and patterns; and to determine trading volumes, audience size and repeated usage. We may then use such data, together with information collected from other users, to manage and customize the Site's content, layout, and our services in order to improve the Sites, enhance customer service, and provide tailored messages. We may combine personal information and non-personal information to conduct analytics in order to improve user experience.

We will use your IP address for legally permitted uses including to provide the services to you, to improve our services and to help diagnose problems with our server.

Furthermore, we may use the information you provide us to contact you about our products and services as legally permitted. Please see the section entitled "Contact Us" for instructions relating to opting out of such use.

The personal information you submit to us either via the Sites (e.g. by completing our on-line forms) or via email may be used to provide you with the response or services you have requested.

We do collect personal information about your online activities over time and across third party websites or online services.  When we see a browser set to "do not track", signals transmitted from web browsers do not apply to our sites, and we do not alter any of our data collection and use practices upon receipt of such a signal.

CME Group offers educational resources: including Risk Ranch and CME Institute (also known as Futures Institute) to increase the awareness of our industry.  CME Group collects information in aggregate for the Risk Ranch and CME Institute, and does not collect or maintain information that identifies any specific individual. The information collected is only used to improve upon functionality and its content.

The Sites may contain links to third party websites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you will be accessing a website that CME Group does not control and which may be governed by privacy policies and practices that differ from ours. CME Group is not, and will not be, responsible for the privacy policies or practices of third parties or the content or security of any third-party websites.

**PUBLIC FORUMS**  (e.g. website comment sections, Blogs, Social Media): Posts, comments or other information you submit on any public forums (e.g. message board, chat rooms) should not be considered private or confidential. CME Group may use any such postings ("Postings"), any content thereof, and any information derived from any such Postings (including any ideas, concepts, know-how or other intellectual property) and may provide such Postings to any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, or others, for any purpose whatsoever, as deemed appropriate in the sole discretion of CME Group and subject to applicable laws.  Posts, comments, and other information you share on these platforms can be read, viewed, collected or used by others accessing these public forums.  We have no responsibility for how others use the information you share on these public forums, such as sending you unsolicited communications, contacting you, or any other usage of your personal information. When registering, you may choose a username (pseudonym) that does not identify you to the general public.

CME Group is under no obligation to review any Postings relating to CME Group and assumes no responsibility or liability relating to any Postings. Nonetheless, CME Group may from time to time monitor the Postings and in its sole discretion and in accordance with law may remove and/or decline to publish any material, including but not limited to:  (i) any Postings that contain any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable material of any kind (ii) advertisements or solicitations of any kind; (iii) messages posted by visitors impersonating others; (iv) personal information, such as messages which list phone numbers, Social Security numbers, account numbers, addresses, or employer references; (v) messages by non-spokesperson employees of CME Group purporting to speak on behalf of the CME Group; (vi)  multiple messages by the same visitor restating the same point; (vii) messages of commercial or reputational damage to CME Group; and (viii) chain letters of any kind.

**SOCIAL NETWORK ACCOUNT INFORMATION** : We may allow you to sign into and associate your social network accounts including, but not limited to, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube with CME Group.

By using this functionality, we deem that you consent by affirmative action to the use of your personal data for the purpose of enabling the functionality.

We may ask you to allow us to access certain elements of your social network profile information you have made available to be shared and to use it in accordance with the social network’s terms of use and this Policy. Each social network will give you full control over what kind of data you will share with us. Please refer to the privacy settings in your social network account for information about what data is shared and to manage the data shared through your account, including information about your activities using our Sites. 

We do not retain your username or password for social networking platforms for any longer than is necessary to complete an interaction. If you would like to disconnect a social media account from CME Group refer to the settings of that social media account and its provider.

**EMAIL SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR NEWSLETTERS, NOTICES, AND SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS:  **If you have subscribed to receive communications from CME Group (e.g., through the CME [Subscription Center](https://go.cmegroup.com/subscription-center-sign-in)), we may contact you by phone, text, mail or email, as applicable, related to company services, market or product announcements and newsletters, sales and marketing communications, and when applicable, service announcements pertaining to system maintenance or disruptions.  Generally, you have the ability to opt-out of these marketing communications at any time by contacting us with the information in the “Contact Us” section of this Policy, clicking on the unsubscribe button located within the message, or directly modifying your preferences in the subscription center. Some non-promotional communications used for administrative purposes, such as service announcements, may be sent to you regardless of your status for receiving marketing communications.

**SALES AND MARKETING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE** : Based upon the CME Group services you use, and as permitted by law, individuals from our sales and marketing and customer service teams may contact you directly by phone, email, mail or text messaging. Should you choose not to be contacted please submit a request to the Data Protection Officer ("Contact Us") or complete the form on "[Unsubscribe – Email Alert Subscription.](http://investor.cmegroup.com/investor-relations/confirm.cfm?Destination=/investor-relations/donotsend.cfmhttp://xn--http-4b7a//investor.cmegroup.com/investor-relations/confirm.cfm?Destination=/investor-relations/donotsend.cfm)"  Unsubscribing from these communications may impact the way CME Group may share information with you regarding the use of our services. 

CME Group may record certain telephone conversations, including phone lines in the Global Command Center, Clearing House, main switchboard, or where required by law. The purpose of such recordings is to provide verification of customer transactions entered in connection with CME Group business, to protect the organization against misconduct, and to ensure the telephone lines are being used consistent with applicable CME Group policies. When a recorded line is being used an announcement will be made at the beginning of the call notifying you that the call may be recorded and that you can object to such recording at the beginning of the call. Consent to such recording and monitoring is presumed by the use of the recorded phone lines without raising such objection. There may be instances where the recording cannot be turned off.  Please use discretion when sharing information over a recorded line as the recording may be retained and used for legal, regulatory, or business purposes. 

**BILLING INFORMATION WHEN YOU ARE PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES** :  There are certain circumstances for which CME Group may collect personal information when you purchase products or services from us.  For the purposes of these transactions, CME Group may collect, use, and maintain personal information such as your name, email, phone number, and mailing address from you. 

Where offered, you may choose to complete your transactions using credit or debit card information (e.g. Online Store, Software, Market Data).  CME Group does not directly process or retain any credit card information. Your credit card information will only be processed and stored with third parties that are Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS") compliant. The third parties are not allowed to share or use any of your information beyond the purposes for which it was collected.  Where available, you may elect to have the third party maintain your credit card information for reoccurring purchases. 

**USE OF CME GROUP TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS** : When using CME Group systems, personal information may be collected and used to authenticate your access such as device type, operating system, browser, IP address, and country of origin.  Additional information may be collected during your use of the technology so CME Group can continue providing you the services applicable to the offering, and tailoring our content as appropriate. Refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy.html).  

For registered users, upon the creation of your profile (by the user or at the request of your organization) personal information is required to be provided.  Personal information collected will vary based on the type of relationship you have with CME Group.  Information collected may include, name, phone number (landline or mobile), email address, physical address, organization name, professional title.

Receipt and use of this verification code may be required in order to gain access to certain CME Group systems.

  * To enforce our Terms and Conditions.
  * If CME Group or any of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information may be one of the transferred assets.

## Children's Privacy

The Sites are general audience sites not directed at children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that any personal information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that information. If you access our Sites from the EU/EEA or if you access an EU/EEA Site, the age limit will be 16.

CME Group does offer a website and a mobile application for students to learn more about our industry.  Please refer to the discussions of Risk Ranch and CME Institute within this Policy for more information under the header "Use of Our Websites".

## Security

CME Group takes security and the protection of your personal information seriously.  We have implemented a physical and logical security program that includes commercially reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. These controls may be updated as new technology and controls become available, or as appropriate.  

To safeguard CME Group facilities and colleagues, CME Group may collect personal information and video when you are on company premises.  Your personal information may be used for security and due diligence purposes.  CME Group uses video recording in public areas of its facilities, 24/7. We will clearly post signs indicating such video surveillance and/or recording on site.

If your contact information should change, please "Contact Us" so that we may update our records accordingly.  

Prior to fulfilling any request for information or deletion, we may require you to provide information so we may verify your identity. Subject to applicable laws, we reserve the right to decline requests that are unreasonable, present risk to the privacy of another individual, may jeopardize the confidentiality of another party, are excessively repetitive, or may require significant technical modifications to our systems. Provided the request is reasonable in nature, all requests for information will be free of charge. CME Group reserves the right to respond to any requests as soon as reasonably possible, but generally within 30 days or one month, whichever is shorter.
