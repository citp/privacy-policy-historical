# Privacy Statement | Policies | NYIT

By using our website or web services, you consent to the collection and use of your information by New York Institute of Technology (“NYIT”). NYIT collects personal information to make our site(s) and service(s) more relevant and rewarding for you to use.

For each visitor to our web pages, our web server automatically recognizes your domain, service provider, operating system, and Internet browser. Our Web server additionally records usage of pages by our visitors. We use this information, in aggregate, for research reports and performance surveys. We sometimes use this non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.

Some of NYIT's site(s) and service(s) collect personally identifiable information to further personalize your experience within a site. Some site(s) and service(s) require that you provide personally identifiable information in order to participate in the activities and offerings within.

We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when we make changes to our services, to fulfill a request by you, or to contact you about your account with us. Most of our communications provide an “opt-out” feature.

We may also use your information to update internal systems. This allows for seamless delivery of services and resources to you across NYIT’s systems.

NYIT’s websites(s) and service(s) may contain email services, bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, personal Web pages, calendars, photo displays, and/or other message or communication facilities designed to enable you to communicate with others (collectively, “Communication Services”). The information we collect in connection with these Communication Services is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these Communication Services. Within many of these Communication Services, NYIT provides you multiple privacy options that allow you to restrict the use and viewability of your information to others.

## Third Party Disclosure

NYIT does not sell, rent, give away, or loan any identifiable information to any third party other than agents and contractors of NYIT.

Agents and contractors of NYIT who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for NYIT.

NYIT may release personal information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i.) comply with law, (ii.) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii.) protect the rights, property, or safety of NYIT, our users, or others.

Some of our site(s) and service(s) contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy statements as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
