<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>We are committed to protecting consumer privacy online. &nbsp;The purpose of our policy is to inform you  about the types of information we gather about you when you visit  strausnews.com or any of its sister sites, which include but are not limited to  advertisernewsnorth.com, advertisernewssouth.com, spartaindependent.com,  townshipjournal.com, warwickadvertiser.com, thephoto-news.com,  chroniclenewspaper.com, westmilfordmessenger.com, pikecountycourier.com, nypress.com, and dirt-mag.com (collectively, the  “Straus News Sites”).&nbsp; The policy also  describes how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone,  and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, that  information.</p>
<p><strong><u>How You Accept  This Policy</u></strong><u></u><br>
  By visiting any of the Straus News Sites, or by otherwise  providing us with personally identifiable information (such as an email  address), you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong><u>How We Gather  Information From Users</u></strong><br>
  How we collect and store information depends on the page you  are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate, and the  services provided. &nbsp;You can visit some  pages on the Straus News Sites without affirmatively providing any information.  &nbsp;Other pages may prompt you to provide  information, such as when you submit a press release, business milestone,  letter to the editor, or a photo to a Straus News Site. You may also provide  information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, voting and  polling activities, photo galleries, message boards, and other areas of the Straus  News Sites.</p>
<p>When you submit any of the above information, we may collect  personal information (“PI”), such your first name and last name, address, or  email address, which you choose to provide to us.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We  may collect PI if you contact us or otherwise give it to us (e.g., in an  email).</p>
<p>Like most websites, we also collect information  automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may not be  transparent to our visitors. We may collect information about the computer,  mobile telephone, smart phone, tablet computer, or other device you use to  access Straus News.&nbsp; For example, we may  log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use “cookie” technology.  Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing  you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may  control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while  visiting the Site. &nbsp;As we adopt  additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. &nbsp;In certain cases, you can choose not to  provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to  accept cookies, but doing so may inhibit the Straus News Sites’ functionality.</p>
<p><strong><u>What We Do With  The Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</u></strong><br>
  We may use information that is not personally identifiable  to enhance the visitor experience of the Straus News Sites, to operate and  maintain the Straus News Sites, to investigate and understand how the Straus  News Sites are used, to monitor and protect the security and integrity of the Straus  News Sites, and to analyze our business.&nbsp;  As one example, we may combine information about your usage patterns  with similar information obtained from other users to learn which pages are  visited most or what features are most attractive. &nbsp;Aggregated information may occasionally be  shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to  contact you individually.</p>
<p><strong><u>How We Use And  Disclose PI</u></strong><u></u><br>
  We may use PI to email you or to otherwise communicate with  you about activities relating to the Straus News Sites and our business,  including marketing and promotion.&nbsp; You  can opt out of receiving future promotional and advertising related emails and  electronic communications by following the unsubscribe link in any such emails.</p>
<p>We may use PI to enhance the visitor experience of the  Straus News Sites, to operate and maintain the Straus News Sites, to  investigate and understand how our Service are used, to analyze our business,  and to monitor and protect the security and integrity of the Straus New Sites.</p>
<p>We may disclose PI as required by law or in response to  service of legal process, such as a court order, summons, subpoena, or the  like.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We may share PI with trusted partners who provide services  related to the Straus News Sites (such as website hosting).&nbsp; These trusted partners do not have the right  to use this PI for any purpose other than those related to the Straus New  Sites.</p>
<p>Information about our users, including PI, may be disclosed  or transferred to entities now or in the future affiliated with us or as part  of any merger, acquisition, change of control, debt financing, insolvency,  bankruptcy or sale of our assets, and may be used in the businesses of any  entity so receiving it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Although  we do not do so now, we may aggregate your PI with that of other users and sell  it to third parties.</p>
<p><strong><u>What Information  We Do Not Collect</u></strong><br>
  When you share or recommend articles or content from any  Straus News Site on Facebook, Twitter, or any other third-party social media  platform, that action is governed by the third-party site’s respective privacy  policy.&nbsp; We do not track or store a  record of those comments or actions, and you should take care to review the  third-party’s privacy policy before sharing any such content.</p>
<p>Moreover, Straus News does not knowingly collect or solicit  personally identifiable information from or about children under the age of  13.&nbsp; If we discover we have received any  information from a child under the age of 13 in violation of this policy, we  will delete that information immediately. If you believe, the Straus News Sites  have any information from or about anyone under the age of 13, please contact  us at webmanager@strausnews.com. &nbsp;Children  under the age of 13 are specifically prohibited from registering as Members of  strausnews.com.</p>
<p><strong><u>Affiliated Sites,  Linked Sites And Advertisements</u></strong><br>
  Straus News expects its partners, advertisers, and  third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users.&nbsp; However, third parties, including our  partners, advertisers, affiliates, and other content providers accessible  through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and  practices.&nbsp; For example, during your  visit to the Straus News Sites you may follow a link to, or view as part of a  frame on a Straus News Site, certain content that is actually created or hosted  by a third party.&nbsp; Also, through the Straus  News Sites you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information,  websites, advertisements, features, contests, or sweepstakes offered by other  parties.&nbsp; Straus News is not responsible  for the actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners, or  other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify  some of your preferences or retrieve information about you.&nbsp; For example, some of our advertising may be  served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to  determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.&nbsp; Through features available on our site, third  parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information.&nbsp; Straus News does not control the use of this  technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions  or policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.  Should you choose to voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information  in public areas on the Site, such as in message boards, chat areas or in  advertising or notices you post, that information can be viewed publicly and  can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result  in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such  activities are beyond the control of Strausnews.com and this policy.</p>
<p><strong><u>How Do I Opt-Out  or Correct Information About Me</u></strong><br>
  You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mail messages  and newsletters from Straus News.&nbsp; We  provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us  at the point where we request information about you.&nbsp; To do so, you can send us a message at  webmanager@strausnews.com.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><u>Data Security</u></strong><br>
  We  do our best to  preserve the integrity and security of your PI.&nbsp;  We cannot, however, ensure the security of any information you transmit  to the Service, and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp;  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive  notice of a security breach in writing or by emailing us at  webmanager@strausnews.com.</p>
<p><strong><u>International  Visitors</u></strong><br>
  This Service is hosted in the United States.&nbsp; If you are an international visitor, you  should note that by providing your PI, you are:&nbsp;  (i) permitting the transfer of your PI to the United States which may  not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you reside; and  (ii) permitting the use of your PI in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p><strong><u>Changes to this  policy</u></strong><br>
  If we make any changes to this policy, we will post such  changes on this page.&nbsp; Such changes shall  become effective immediately upon posting and, unless provided otherwise, will  not apply retroactively.&nbsp; If we make any  material changes and you have provided us with an e-mail address, we will do  our best to notify you of any such changes.&nbsp; </p>
