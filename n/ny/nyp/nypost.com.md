PRIVACY POLICY

_Effective as of April 18, 2005_   
**NYP Holdings, Inc. ("The Post")** , which includes The New York Post, NYPOST.COM, NYPOSTSTORE.COM, STORE.NYPOST.COM and other Internet sites controlled by The Post ( **"Post Sites"** ), is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html) applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. The Post has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. 

From time to time The Post may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, technology, industry initiatives, the features of the Post Sites or off-line data collection practices. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. 

**COLLECTION:** COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY THE POST 

_GENERAL_. The Post collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) in order to create or enhance our relationship with you. For example, The Post collects PII from you when you register for full access to Post Sites. Users who have supplied Post Sites with PII in the past (for example, by entering a contest or sweepstakes, signing up for home delivery of the Print Edition, or registering for our Daily Newsletter) will also be required to complete the registration process. You can register for full access to Post Sites [here](http://www.nypost.com/register). We also collect PII when you participate in activities on Post Sites such as sweepstakes, contests, surveys, forums, bulletin boards, polls, e-mailing to a friend and subscription registrations; when you submit comments, content or suggestions to us; or when you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties. 

_COOKIES_. Cookies are small bits of information that Post Sites place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on our sites and enable The Post to make your visits to Post Sites more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your name and password for easy logon to a site you have previously visited, can keep track of whether or not you have voted in an online poll, can save information concerning the sections and/or stories you visit the most or can track the items you have placed in your "shopping cart" during a visit to our online store. Information about your activities on Post Sites and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests. 

Third party advertisements displayed on Post Sites may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers (See "Notice" below). The Post does not control these cookies and visitors to Post Sites should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. 

The Post may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of Post Sites to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on Post Sites can allow us to limit the materials we send you to items we know you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if The Post wishes to combine personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express prior consent. 

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being set or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you won't have access to most features of the Post Sites, such as our stories, our email newsletter, voting in polls, shopping in the online store, purchasing home delivery or using the customized features of our online searchable real estate listings database. 

**NOTICE:** THE POST WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES 

When The Post collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses we will make of the information. 

At the time your PII is collected, The Post will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable information, including whether we can share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below). This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore want to share your personal information, provided you have given The Post permission to do so (See "Use" below). 

Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format, such as a post card, in-paper contest, or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us. 

The Post Sites may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a NYPOST.COM logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by The Post (for example, special sections appearing online are hosted and maintained by another company). The Post Sites also carry advertisements from other companies. Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, The Post is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to Post Sites or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies. Once you've left a Post Site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you. 

The Post Sites may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with The Post (i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy. 

Some of the advertisements that appear on Post Sites are delivered to you by national Internet advertising companies such as DoubleClick, Atlas DMT and 24/7 Real Media. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to Post Sites, including information about the banner ads they display, their cookie and your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit their websites at:

**CHOICE:** THE POST WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII 

The Post will not use the PII we collect from you for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with The Post, unless we obtain your consent. 

**USE:** THE POST'S USE OF PII 

The Post will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. If The Post obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Policy. 

The Post may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, part of the News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us permission, The Post may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not part of the News America Group of companies, but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, we may offer promotions, contests, or sweepstakes in conjunction with a business partner with whom we may share your PII. When we do this, there will be a link to the partner's privacy policy when PII is collected. Moreover, we will never share your credit card information with third parties except those The Post uses to perform tasks (such as order fulfillment and payment processing) required to complete purchases you make through Post Sites. 

Post employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. The Post may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use your PII to provide The Post with a specific service and not for any other purpose. 

The Post may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows The Post to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on Post Sites. Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on Post Sites may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with The Post's advertisers and business partners. 

There may be instances when The Post may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of The Post, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to Post Sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if The Post sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, The Post may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction. 

**SECURITY:** THE POST PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII 

The Post uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, The Post uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. Passwords stored by The Post are encrypted both in transit and when stored within The Post's online databases.
