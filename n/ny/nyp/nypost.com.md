_Information Collected by the Site_

**NY Post Services Activity Information**. When users visit the NY Post Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the NY Post Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, other software or hardware information. If you access the NY Post Services from a mobile device, we may also collect transactional information such as a unique device identified assigned to that device (“UDID”), your geolocation, or other transactional information for the device in order to serve content to it. We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the NY Post Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. If NY Post wishes to combine your personal information with information we obtain through these technologies in order to determine what messages NY Post provides to you, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.

Third-parties that support the NY Post Services by, for example, serving advertisements or providing services, such as tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. NY Post does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see [www.aboutads.info/consumers](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers). 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies).

**Third Parties**. To improve the quality of NY Post Services, we may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties. If you access NY Post through a third-party connection or log-in, we may also collect your public user ID associated with that third-party service, and any information you may have made public in connection with that service and that the third party shares with partner services.

Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation corporate [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html), users who visit an Affiliated Company site should still refer to its separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.
