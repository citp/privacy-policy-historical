The New York Post reviews its Privacy Policy periodically, and reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify or remove portions of this Policy at any time. This page should be reviewed from time to time, so that you can be aware of any changes. If you want to communicate with us about our Policy, or about the use of your personal information, or to change personal information previously submitted to this site, please write to us at:

**GENERAL POLICY** New York Post (the "Post") recognizes the privacy concerns of visitors to our site on the Internet (www.nypost.com) and the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected from them. As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as a visitor's name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number, is automatically collected on our website. Such information is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted, and the Post uses such information only for the purpose for which it was submitted unless we disclose other uses in this Policy or at the time of collection. You will have the opportunity to instruct the Post not to use your personal information for a different purpose, either at the time of collection, in response to a specific request for permission from the Post, or by contacting us at the mailing or e-mail address listed above. We maintain reasonable and appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of such information in our possession. 

The Post does not knowingly collect personally indentifiable information from children under 13. 

**COOKIES** Cookies are small bits of information that our site places on the hard drive of your computer to enable us to do a number of things to make your visit and future visits more enjoyable. For example, cookies allow a visitor quickly to log on to a site he/she has used before by storing a password. Cookies are not used to obtain information about a user that was not previously provided in a cookie. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifiable information about a user, and the Post does not use cookies in order to obtain such information. Cookies are used by most major sites on the Internet. Visitors may receive cookies from third parties, but the Post cannot control the content of these cookies. Users should consult their browser owner's manual for instructions on how to refuse cookies.

**IP ADDRESSES** The Post may collect and disclose non-personal user information (for example, IP addresses) in aggregate form. An IP address is a number given to a user by a Web Server. Examples of information provided by an IP address include service provider, type of browser and type of system used. The Post may use this information to make its site better and more responsive to the needs of the user. This non-personal information may also be shared with third parties for marketing, advertising or research purposes. An IP address is not used to obtain personal information about a user.

**COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION** The Post collects personally identifiable information for a number of purposes, which are described below. In addition to the uses indicated in each of the following paragraphs, the Post may use personal information you submit to this site for research, advertising, and marketing purposes, including sending you information about products and services offered by the Post we think you will be interested in. We may also share your information with other parts of our company, with our advertisers and with business partners so they, too, can inform you about products and services we think you will find interesting.

When we collect your personal information you will have the ability to tell the Post not to contact you about our other products or services, and/or not to share your information with affiliated companies or third parties. If you want you information removed from our database at any time, you can contact us at the mailing or e-mail address indicated above. However, we will not be able to delete your historical usage data from our records.

**Obtaining At Home Delivery of the Post** Visitors to our site who want to receive at-home delivery of the New York Post can submit personal information to the site that makes possible a follow-up contact by a circulation representative.

**On-Line Surveys** The Post may conduct on-line marketing surveys that ask participants for demographic and other similar data (such as zip code, age, income and education level). This information is used to make the Post more responsive to our readers and may be shared in aggregate, non-personal form with our advertisers and business partners.

**Newsletters**

The Post collects e-mail addresses and other personally identifying information in order to send users newsletters and other materials they have requested, and in connection with surveys and contests. The Post relies on other companies, such as ROI Interactive, to register users for its newletter service and to actually transmit the newsletter or other materials to users. However, these companies are prohibited from using the e-mail addresses for any other purpose or from sharing these e-mail addresses with third parties.

**On-Line Shopping** The Post has access to personally identifiable information that is submitted in order to fulfill the purchases our visitors make through our on line shopping services. The Post may use this information in non-personal, aggregate form to make our site better and more responsive to visitors' needs. 

**Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions** The Post may run contests, sweepstakes or promotions on our site that may require submission of personally identifiable information by participants. Some of this information may be shared with a reputable outside company that administers the contest for the Post. However, this company is prohibited from using this information for any other purpose. The Post may use the information collected during a contest in the aggregate so we can tell, for example, how many visitors to our site participate in the contest feature.

**Comments and Submissions** The Post may obtain information from a user when he or she sends us comments, requests information on-line about the opportunities for advertising in the Post or responds to employment opportunities posted on our site. Any comments or ideas posted to this site or submitted to the Post become the property of the Post, which may use such comments or ideas in any way it sees fit.

**Links to Other Sites** The Post may establish relationships with reputable business partners that allow visitors to the Post site to link directly to sites operated by these partners. In some cases, the linked site may be branded or "co-branded" with the Post's logo; however, it is not operated or maintained by the Post or its affiliated companies. For example, the link labeled "MARKET WATCH" takes the user to a web site operated by Thomson Investors Network, which hosts and manages this financial service for the Post. Similarly, the link labeled "SHOPPING" takes the user to a "mall" operated for the Post by Internet Tradeline, Inc. and then to individual online merchants' sites who fulfill the user's purchase. 

Some of the advertisements that appear on the Post site are delivered to you by advertising companies such as DoubleClick and 24/7 Media. The site also uses the services of Engage to deliver ads, promotions and other marketing messages. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages. Privacy issues surrounding their respective technologies are discussed in their own privacy policies, which can be viewed at [www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy](http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy), [www.247media.com/privacy](http://www.247media.com/privacy) and [www.engage.com/privacy](http://www.engage.com/privacy). 

The Post chooses its advertisers and business partners carefully. However, the Post is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third party web sites that may be linked to this site. These links are meant for the user's convenience only, and do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement or approval by the Post of the content, policies or practices of such sites. Once you have left the Post's site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. 

The Post sites may also be linked to web sites operated by companies affiliated with the Post. Visitors to those sites should refer to each site's separate privacy policy.
