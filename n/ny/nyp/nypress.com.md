Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested.

Our servers may also automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the Website, including without limitation the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the Website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. Your IP address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university.

**How the Website Uses Information Provided by You**

New York Press may use your user name and password to grant you access to and use of the Website. Your email address will be used, at your request, to send you a copy of your user name and password. If you provide personally identifiable information, it will be used to provide you with the service you have requested. We may also use the information provided by you to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services that We offer by tailoring them to your needs.

We also allow access to Our database by third parties that provide Us with services such as technical maintenance, forums and coupon software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. If you choose to purchase items through features on the Website, We may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment. You may provide information about yourself to Us in areas of the Website that are managed or participated in by third parties, such as job boards or shopping areas. In such cases, the information provided may be used by Us and by such third parties, each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information to Our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. While We will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, We do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. We may also provide access to Our database in order to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings, for example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders or other legal process.

In addition, We reserve the right to use the information We collect about your computer, which may at times be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with Our servers, to gather broad demographic information and to otherwise administer the Website.

While your personally identifying information is protected as outlined above, We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell and share data about Our users for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.

In addition, as Our business changes, We may buy or sell various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by New York Press, its parent company or any subsidiary or affiliated entities are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, the information from and/or about the Website users may be among the transferred assets.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

We may use cookies or web beacons (“pixel tags,” “clear pixels”) to control the display of ads, track usage patterns on the Website, deliver editorial content and record registration and personalization information. Our cookies may contain personally identifiable information and such cookies may be shared with Our affiliates and other companies. Some of Our advertisers may serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.

We may use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the Website. These vendors may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have displayed by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before or to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data, such as your browser type, operating system, Web pages visited, time of visit, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their privacy policies, not Ours, and We disclaim all liability in connection therewith.

If you do not want to receive cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you to not accept them. However, some portions of the Website may not function properly if cookies are rejected by your browser.

**Information Security and Notification**

Because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, New York Press cannot guarantee the security of any information you send to Us or the security of Our servers or databases. By using the Website, you agree to assume any and all risk related to information sent to Us or collected by Us when you use the Website. In the unlikely event that We believe the security of information about you in Our possession or control to have been compromised, We may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, We may notify you by email provided that We have your email address.

The Website is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (“Minor Children”), and collecting personal information from Minor Children through the Services of the Website is strictly prohibited. Minor Children are not allowed to provide any personal information or use Our public discussion areas, forums or chats. No content should be directed toward Minor Children by other users. Minor Children are not eligible to use the Website, and We do not knowingly accept their personal information. Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 must have the permission of a parent or legal guardian before making purchases, including subscriptions, on the Website.

If Minors disclose information about themselves in publicly accessible areas of the Website, they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to prevent them from doing so.
