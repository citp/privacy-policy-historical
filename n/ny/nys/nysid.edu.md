## NYSID's Internet Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting NYSID's Web site. We are committed to providing the latest technologies and online services to both our visitors and members of the NYSID community. We are also committed to privacy issues, and we would like to take this opportunity to tell you about what information we collect, how we use this information and your rights concerning this information. This privacy policy applies only to www.nysid.edu, which is maintained by NYSID, and not to Web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. NYSID is therefore not responsible for the content or activities provided on these other sites.

## What information do we collect, and how do we use it?

NYSID only collects personal information on a voluntary basis. Our Web site may be visited without revealing any personal information about yourself. However, there are several pieces of "passive" information we collect from you each time you access our Web site. We log your computer's IP address, the URL that referred you to our site, if any, the pages you access at our sites, and the ype and version of both your operating system and Web browser. We also track any terms and phrases that you enter into our search engine service. None of this information is ever used to personally identify you or any other user, but rather it is collected and reviewed by select employees of NSYID only and used to generate reports fo site usage. These reports help us to identify what parts of the site are most popular, what search engines visitors are using to find our Web sites, and what things visitors are having trouble finding. These reports help us determine overall Web site usage, identify problem areas, and ultimately provide better services for visitors like yourself.

You can configure your Web browser to allow or disallow _cookies_ by changing eey expire at a predetermined time.

From time to time, there will be a service provided by our Web site that will require you to provide personal information. If you choose to share personal information with us—by sending us a message or filling out an electronic form with personal information—we will only use that information as necessary to conduct official NYSID business. For example in order to complete our online Admissions Application, you obviously must provide us with some personal information. We will use this information you supply to us for the sole purpose of reviewing and processing your application. Some of the information may be saved for a designated period to comply with applicable legal requirements. We will never disclose any information that we gather from you to vendors, sponsors, other third parties or other government agencies, unless required to do so by state or federal law.
