The information is retained in accordance with the public record retention provisions in the State Arts and Cultural Affairs Law.

## Payment Card Information

If you initiate a payment card transaction through an online application on this website, NYSED provides a data entry screen that securely transmits your data directly to a third-party Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant payment card service provider. NYSED does not receive or retain any of your personal information, payment card or account information. The payment card service provider transmits only a successful or unsuccessful confirmation message back to NYSED so that NYSED can properly complete the transaction. For more information about PCI compliance, visit the PCI Security Standards Council website.

## General Information about Children’s Online Privacy

NYSED does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles of children through this website. Users are cautioned, however, that the collection of personal information provided by any individual in an email or through an online transaction will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access. NYSED encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children's Internet activities and to provide guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information on-line.

NYSED does not solicit information from children under the age of thirteen. If the NYSED receives information submitted by children under the age of thirteen, those communications are accorded the same protections as if the information had been submitted offline.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) imposes restrictions on commercial Websites, not government agency websites. Although COPPA does not apply to the NYSED Website, the NYSED practices are consistent with its mandates. If you would like more information about COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission's official [COPPA page](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy).
