# Welcome to New York's College Savings Program

**Disclosure & Privacy Statement**

**PRIVACY POLICY OF TIAA-CREF**  
This notice provides information concerning the privacy policy of TIAA-CREF and Teachers Personal Investors Services, Inc. (together referred to in this section as "TIAA-CREF") with respect to nonpublic information they may have about current and former Account Owners (customers). 

TIAA-CREF may collect nonpublic personal information about you from various sources, including:   
(i) Information you provide, for example, on participation agreements or other forms;  
(ii) Information about your participation in the Program, such as investments; and   
(iii) Information from third parties such as consumer reporting agencies. 

Your nonpublic personal information is used to effect your investment in the program or to provide you with related transaction services. If you elect to receive information about financial products and services offered by TIAA-CREF and its affiliates (including insurance companies, brokers-dealers, investment companies, investment advisers and a trust company), your nonpublic personal information also may be shared with these affiliates to determine your possible interest in such products and services, and to mail you information about them. 

TIAA-CREF limits access to your nonpublic personal information to its employees who need to know that information to provide Program-related services to you. Further, your nonpublic personal inform ation is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in accordance with federal and state standards. 

TIAA-CREF does not disclose your nonpublic personal information to anyone outside of the Program, unless it has received proper authorization from you or it is permitted or required by the Program Management Agreement and applicable law to do so. 

**NOTICE ABOUT PRIVACY  
**Safeguarding your personal information is something New York's College Savings Program takes very seriously. 

When you visit the Program Web site, you can go to pages that are open to the general public or log onto secure pages where access is permitted only after you have supplied your Social Security Number and PIN. This information serves to verify your identity, so that only you can access your account and initiate transactions through the Web site. 

New York's College Savings Program is committed to protecting your privacy on-line. When you log on to secure pages, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol for securing information. SSL has been universally accepted on the World Wide Web for authenticated and encrypted communication between clients and servers. In addition, all data that you send to us and we confirm back to you, is sent over an encrypted SSL connection protected with a mechanism for detecting tampering — that is, for automatically determining whether the data has been altered in transit. This basically means that the data sent is encrypted and can only be decrypted by our web server. Your data is stored on a secure server behind our firewall, which means no one from the outside can access this server. **Also, we do NOT send or receive any cookies from this web server**. 

To use this site you need a browser that supports encryption and dynamic Web page construction. We strongly recommend Netscape Navigator version 4.0 or higher, or Microsoft Internet version 4.0 or higher. 

To help ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your information: 

  * Do not share your Personal Identification Number, Social Security Number or taxpayer identification number with anyone. 
  * Call the Program's toll-free number at **1 (877) NYSAVES** if you suspect any willful misuse of this site.



If you provide personal information to effect a transaction, only a record of the transaction performed while on the Web Site is retained by the Program's secure system. If you provide personal information in order to receive materials about New York's College Savings Program, such information will be used for that purpose only. 

Personal information provided to the Program is not sold or bartered. In addition, the personal information provided through this Web site is not revealed to any person or organization outside of TIAA, its affiliates, the Office of the Comptroller of the State of New York and the Higher Education Services Corporation unless: 

• proper authorization or direction from you to do so has been received,   
• it is required by law, or   
• it is necessary to do so in order to enable service providers to perform work on behalf of the Program. 

The Program may periodically review its procedures and reserves the right to amend them. You will be kept informed of any changes to the practices set forth in this notice. 

**Disclosure Statement  
**New York's College Savings Program is described in the current Program Brochure. Accounts are opened by completing an Enrollment Form. These documents should be read carefully before opening an account. The State of New York, its agencies, TIAA and its affiliates do not insure any account or guarantee its principal or investment return (except to the extent of the guarantee by TIAA-CREF Life Insurance Company to the Program Trust under the funding agreement for the Guaranteed Option). Account value will fluctuate based upon a number of factors, including general financial market conditions. Federal, state and local tax benefits are subject to certain limitations. If you are not a New York State resident or have taxable income in another state, you should consider whether that state offers a 529 plan with favorable state income tax benefits that are not available through this Program. You should consult your tax advisor. Non-qualified withdrawals are subject to federal and state tax. Investments may be made through Teachers Personal Investors Services, Inc., distributor.
