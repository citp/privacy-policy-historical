    <p>Thank you for visiting the New York State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP) website. This website is designed 
    to make it easier and more efficient for individuals and businesses to interact with New York State Parks, Recreation and Historic 
    Preservation. OPRHP recognizes that it is critical for individuals and businesses to be confident that their privacy is protected when 
    they visit the OPRHP website.</p>
        
	<p>Consistent with the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Law and the Personal Privacy 
	Protection Law, this policy describes OPRHP's privacy practices regarding information collected from users of this website. This policy 
	describes what data is collected and how that information is used. OPRHP may, at its sole discretion, change modify, add, or delete 
	portions of this policy. Because this privacy policy only applies to this website, you should examine the privacy policy of any website, 
	including other State websites, you access through this website.</p>

	<p>For purposes of this policy, "personal information" means any information concerning a natural person, as opposed for instance 
	to a corporate entity, which, because of name, number, symbol, mark, or other identifier, can be used to identify that natural person. 
	OPRHP only collects personal information about you when you provide that information voluntarily by sending an e-mail or by initiating 
	an online transaction, such as a survey, registration or order form.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Information Collected Automatically When You Visit this Website</span><br>
	When visiting this website OPRHP automatically collects and stores the following information about your visit:</p>

	<ol type="1">
		<li>The Internet Protocol address and domain name of your Internet service provider. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical 
		identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer, which can be used to direct internet traffic 
		to you;</li>
		<li>The type of browser and operating system you used;</li>
		<li>The date and time you visited this site; </li>
		<li>The web pages or services you accessed at this site; </li>
		<li>The URL or web site address of the web site you visited prior to coming to this website and from which any web page on this 
		site was linked; and</li>
		<li>If you downloaded a form, the form that was downloaded.</li>
	</ol>
		
	<p>None of the foregoing information is deemed to constitute personal information.</p>

	<p>This information that is collected automatically is used to improve this website's content and to help OPRHP understand how 
	people are using this website. This information is collected for statistical analysis, to determine what information is of most and of least 
	interest to 	our visitors, and to identify system performance or problem areas. The information is not collected for commercial 
	marketing purposes and OPRHP does not sell or distribute the information collected from the website for commercial marketing 
	purposes.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cookies</span><br>
	Cookies are simple text files stored on your web browser to provide a means of distinguishing 	among users of this website. The use of 
	cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. In order to better serve you, we may use "temporary" cookies to enhance, 
	customize or enable your visit to this web site. Temporary cookies do not contain personal information 	and do not compromise your 
	privacy or security and are erased during the operation of your 	browser or when your browser is closed.</p>

	<p>During your visit to this website, you may complete a registration form in order to personalize your use of the website. In such an 
	event, we may deliver a "persistent" cookie which would be stored on your computer's hard drive. This persistent cookie will allow the 
	website to recognize you when you visit again and tailor the information presented to you based on your needs and interests. OPRHP 
	uses persistent cookies only with your permission.</p>

	<p>The software you use to access the website allows you to refuse new cookies or delete existing cookies. Refusing or deleting these 
	cookies may limit your ability to take advantage of some of the features of this website.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Information Collected When You Email this Website or Initiate an Online Transaction Through this 
	Website</span><br>
	If during your visit to this website you send an email to OPRHP, your email address and the contents of your email will be collected. 
	The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us. 
	The information is retained in accordance with the public record retention provisions in the State Arts and Cultural Affairs Law. Your 
	email address and the information contained in your email will be used to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to further 
	improve this website, or to forward your email to another agency for appropriate action. Your email address is not collected for 
	commercial marketing purposes and OPRHP does not sell or distribute your email address for any purposes.</p>

	<p>During your visit to this website you may initiate a transaction such as a survey, registration or order form. The information, 
	including personal information, volunteered by you in initiating the transaction is used by OPRHP to operate OPRHP programs, which 
	include the provision of goods, services and information. The information collected by OPRHP may be disclosed by OPRHP for those 
	purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in connection with which the information 
	was submitted by you.</p>

	<p>Currently, OPRHP does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles of children through this website. 
	People are cautioned that the collection of personal information provided by any individual in an email or through an online transaction 
	will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject 
	to public access. OPRHP encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children's Internet activities and to provide guidance 
	whenever children are asked to provide personal information on-line.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Information and Choice</span><br>
	As noted above, OPRHP does not collect any personal information about you during your visit to this website, unless you provide that 
	information voluntarily by sending an e-mail or initiating an online transaction such as a survey, registration, or order form. You may 
	choose not to send us an e-mail, respond to a survey or complete an order form. While your choice not to participate in these activities 
	may limit your ability to receive specific services or products through this website, it will not prevent you from requesting services or 
	products from OPRHP by other means, and will not normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other features of the 
	website, including browsing or downloading most publicly available information.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Disclosure of Information Collected Through This Website</span><br>
	The collection of information through this website and the disclosure of that information are subject to the provisions of the Internet 
	Security and Privacy Act. OPRHP will only collect personal information through this website, or disclose such personal information, if the 
	user has consented to the collection and disclosure of such personal information. The voluntary disclosure of personal information to 
	OPRHP by the user, whether solicited or unsolicited, constitutes consent to the collection and disclosure of the information by OPRHP for 
	the purposes for which the user disclosed the information to OPRHP, as was reasonably ascertainable from the nature and terms of the 
	disclosure.</p>

	<p>However, OPRHP may collect or disclose personal information without user consent if the collection or disclosure is: (1) necessary 
	to perform the statutory duties of OPRHP, or necessary for OPRHP to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state or 
	federal statute or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order or by law; (3) for the purpose of validating the identity of the user; or 
	(4) of information to be used solely for statistical purposes that is in a form that cannot be used to identify any particular person.</p>

	<p>Further, the disclosure of information, including personal information, collected through 	this website is subject to the provisions of 
	the Freedom of Information Law and the Personal Privacy Protection Law. Additionally, OPRHP may disclose personal information to 
	federal or State law enforcement authorities to enforce its rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to 
	OPRHP's information technology assets and any other inappropriate use of its website.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Retention of Information Collected Through this Website</span><br>
	The information collected through this website is retained by OPRHP in accordance with the records retention and disposition 
	requirements of the New York State Arts and Cultural Affairs Law. Information on the requirements of the Arts and Cultural Affairs Law 
	may be found at <a href="http://www.archives.nysed.gov/a/records/mr_laws_state.shtml">http://www.archives.nysed.gov/a/records/mr_laws_state.shtml<img src="/Images/NewSite.gif" title="Leaving New York State Parks" style="margin-left:3px;" border="0"></a>. 
	In general, the Internet services logs of OPRHP, comprising electronic files or automated logs created to monitor access and use of 
	state agency services provided through this website, are retained for one year and then destroyed. Information, including personal 
	information that you submit in an e-mail or when you initiate an online transaction such as a survey, registration form, or order form 
	is retained in accordance with the records retention and disposition schedule established for the records of the program unit to which 
	you submitted the information. Information concerning these record retention and disposition schedules may be obtained through the 
	Internet privacy policy contact listed in this policy.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Access to and Correction of Personal Information Collected Through this Website</span><br>
	Any user may submit a request to the OPRHP privacy officer to determine whether personal information pertaining to that user has 
	been collected through this website. Any such request shall be made in writing to the address below and must be accompanied by 
	reasonable proof of identity of the user. Reasonable proof of identity may include verification of a signature, inclusion of an identifier 
	generally known only to the user, or similar appropriate identification. The address of OPRHP's privacy compliance officer is: <b>Privacy Officer, New 
	York State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Empire State Plaza, Agency Building 1, Albany, NY  12238.</b></p>

	<p>The privacy compliance officer shall, within five (5) business days of the date of the receipt of a proper request: (i) provide access 
	to the personal information; (ii) deny access in writing, explaining the reasons therefore; or (iii) acknowledge the receipt of the 
	request 	in writing, stating the approximate date when the request will be granted or denied, which date shall not be more than thirty 
	(30) days from the date of the acknowledgment.</p>

	<p>In the event that OPRHP has collected personal information pertaining to a user through the state agency website, and that 
	information is to be provided to the user pursuant to the user's request, the privacy compliance officer shall inform the user of his or 
	her right to request that the personal information be amended or corrected under the procedures set forth in section 95 of the Public 
	Officers Law.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Confidentiality and Integrity of Personal Information Collected Through this Website</span>
	OPRHP limits employee access to personal information collected through this website to only those employees who need access to the 
	information in the performance of their official duties. Employees who have access to this information are required to follow 
	appropriate procedures in connection with any disclosures of personal information.</p>

	<p>In addition, OPRHP has implemented procedures to safeguard the integrity of its information technology assets, including, but not 
	limited to, authentication, monitoring, auditing and encryption. These Security measures have been integrated into the design, 
	implementation, and day-to-day operations of this website as part of our continuing commitment to the security of electronic content 
	as well as the electronic transmission of information.</p>

	<p>NOTE: The information contained in this policy should not be construed in any way as giving business, legal, or other advice, or 
	warranting as fail proof, the security of information provided via this website. For site security purposes and to ensure that this website 
	remains available to all users, OPRHP employs software to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change 
	information or otherwise cause damage to this website.</p>
