<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nysun.com/terms.php">Terms of Use</a></li>
<li><b>Privacy Policy</b></li>
</ul>


<p>At The New York Sun, we know how our customers and visitors like you value your privacy, and we have created this privacy policy to ensure that you understand our policies and procedures, what personal information we may collect and, ultimately, just how we use such personal information.</p>

<p><b>Information Collected By The New York Sun</b></p>

<p>The New York Sun collects two types of information from users of this website and the services offered on this Site (collectively, the "Site"): personal information described below; and non-personal information such as information about traffic patterns on the Site (for example, how many users log on to the Site on a daily basis).</p>

<p><b>Personal Information</b></p>

<p>You are not required to submit personal information to browse this Site. However, should you wish to subscribe to The New York Sun, you may order your subscription online through this Site, in which case we will request some personal information (such as your name, postal address and email address) and financial information (such as your credit card number and its expiration date) to process your subscription. Contact information from your order form may be used to fulfill subscriptions, to get in touch with you when necessary regarding your order and for other purposes, such as to provide information about our company to you. Credit card information that is collected is used to process your subscription, and will not be shared with third parties who are not involved with the transaction (but we may share non-credit card, non-personal information, such as information about which purchases you select, with third parties not involved in fulfilling your orders). We will use commercially reasonable efforts to secure and protect the privacy of your information.</p>

<p>In addition, should you choose to enter or respond to a contest, survey, sweepstakes or other promotional feature, we may ask you for your name, address and email address or other personal information. We will also collect any additional information or materials that you voluntarily provide to us (for further information, please see the Proprietary Rights to Content Section of our Terms of Use.</p>

<p><b>How We Use Your Personal Information</b></p>

<p>The New York Sun uses the information collected, including personally identifiable information, for a variety of purposes. For example, we use your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better news products and services. We may use your information to communicate back to you, to update you on our newspaper, services and benefits, to personalize the Site for you, to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information, newsletters, or other information on behalf of ourselves or third parties that we think would be of particular interest. We will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such materials.</p>

<p>We may also share your personal information with our affiliates, consultants, distributors, newspaper vendors, third party auditors and other third parties who make the Site or our newspaper available, enhance the Site's functionality or provide associated services who deal with you in processing your orders and/or delivering content, samples, products, services and gifts and prizes. Please note that we reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information and other information to our successors in business and purchasers of Site assets.</p>

<p>Information obtained through the Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources.</p>

<p><b>Non-Personal Data</b></p>

<p>In some cases, we may collect non-personal information. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system application software, and peripherals you are using and the domain name of the web site from which you linked to our Site. We use your information on an aggregated basis to do such things as operate our site, enhance our Site and sell and deliver advertising. We may share non-personal information with third parties for advertising, promotional and other purposes.</p>
