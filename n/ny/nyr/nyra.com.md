The Sites use cookies to tailor and enhance your experience on the Sites, to show you content that you might be interested in, and to display the content according to your preferences. By continuing to browse the Site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that the Sites store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer or device if you agree. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer or device’s hard drive. Cookies permit this website to recognize future visits from that computer. Cookies do not damage your system or impair its functioning in any way.

The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites. We use cookies to track users’ traffic patterns when you make any requests for the Sites’ services. When you make your request, NYRA may use a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit on the Sites. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to allow your browser to show you when a cookie is sent. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of the Sites.

Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage to our services are strictly prohibited and shall be punishable under applicable state or federal law. Please be advised, however, that the internet and various networking communication mediums are not secure, unless explicitly stated as such, and may be subject to interception or loss which is beyond the control of NYRA. NYRA uses SSL encryption to protect your personal information during your online interactions with NYRA. NYRA’s SSL uses SHA-2 and 2048-bit encryption which ensures server and client authentication through encrypted algorithms, and is the highest industry standard. NYRA utilizes procedures to protect confidential information offline, as well.  NYRA restricts access to your Personal Identifiable Information to employees who need the information to perform a specific task for you or NYRA. NYRA’s employees use password protected logins to access the Sites’ servers to protect against unauthorized access, acquisition, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of information. The servers which hold Personally Identifiable Information are maintained in a locked, secure hosting environment. Your SSNs, bank account and credit card details are all encrypted while saved on our server.
