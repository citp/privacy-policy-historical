# Privacy Policy - New York & Company

New York & Company believes it is important to let visitors to nyandcompany.com (the "Website") know what types of information we collect online, and how we may use and share that information. In this online Privacy Policy, "we", "our" or "us" refers to New York & Company, and "you" or "your" refers to each visitor to the Website. Except for the section titled Your California Privacy Rights, this Privacy Policy applies only to information that we collect about you on the Website.

**What Information We Collect**

When you shop on the website, we will collect the information necessary to complete your order, such as your name, e- mail address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card number and/or debit card number) and billing address. If you create an Account, we will collect information about your purchases and payment methods, as well as the shipping addresses that you add to your Address Book, in order to make future shopping experiences faster and more convenient. You may change or delete the saved information anytime. Simply go to My Account, and log in with your email address and password. You may edit or delete whatever personal information you wish.

We will collect personal information from you whenever you enter the online contests that we occasionally offer on the website. This information may include your name, mailing address, phone number and e-mail address.

**New York & Company Credit Card:**  
If you apply online for a New York & Company credit card, you will be providing your personal information directly to the issuing bank for the New York & Company credit card. However, your name, address, phone number, birth date and credit card account number, as well as any additional information necessary for us to provide you with the bonuses and benefits of a New York & Company credit card, may be provided to us by the card issuer.

**General Browsing:**  
We gather navigational information about where visitors go on the Website and information about the technical efficiencies of our Website and services (i.e., time to connect to the Website, time to download pages, etc.). This information allows us to see which areas of our Website are most visited and helps us better understand our visitors' experiences at the website. This helps us improve the quality of the Website by recognizing and delivering more of the features, areas and services our visitors prefer. In this process of gathering navigational information, non-personally identifiable information (for example, domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address) may be collected.

**Use of Cookies:**  
The Website uses a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive and are used to help track clicks as you go through the pages within our Website. We may also use cookies to tell us whether you have previously visited the website. In addition, if you elect to register for one of the online sweepstakes or promotions that we offer at the Website, cookies might allow us to associate your navigational information with your registration information. You can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. Turning off cookies will not prevent you from placing your order.

**Use of Pixel Tags and JavaScript Tags:**  
We also use "pixel tags" (also called "web beacons" or "clear gifs") and JavaScript tags, placed on our Website and in our emails, but not on your computer. These tags help us analyze our customers' online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our Website and our advertising. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.

The tags on our Website may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with our Website. This information may include your computer's internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of other websites that you visit.

Pixel tags, JavaScript tags and cookies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us. If you have turned off cookies and disabled JavaScript, the pixel tags and JavaScript tags will only detect you as an anonymous visitor to our Website.

We also work with third-party companies that use tracking technologies to serve advertisements on our behalf across the internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to our Website and your interaction with our advertising and other communications.

We use standard, well accepted data encryption technology when transferring and receiving your personal information. A solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your web browser window confirms the site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

You can also confirm your data is being encrypted by looking at the URL line of your browser (the place where you type website addresses). When accessing a secure server, the site address will change from "http" to "https".

While we use the foregoing security measures to protect your information, please note that no data transmitted over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
