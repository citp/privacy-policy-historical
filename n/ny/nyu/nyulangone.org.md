## Personally Identifiable Information

NYU Langone public websites do not collect personally identifiable information about you when you visit, unless you voluntarily provide us with that information.

When you visit NYU Langone websites, we automatically collect and store non-personally identifiable information such as data sent by your web browser, including the internet address of your computer (IP address) in server logs.

We also collect standard information about your computer, such as your web browser and operating system, and about your usage of our websites, such as pages visited, length of visit, and search queries. This information, which does not identify you personally, is aggregated and used to help diagnose problems and suggest areas for improving our websites.
