We use this information to manage our contractual relationship with you.

We use various internet technologies to manage, and track the use of, the NYT Services. We use and disclose this information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Information that we collect using these technologies is combined with personal information about you. If we combine information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information.

_**A) Device Information.**_  We collect information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the NYT Services, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses (the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the Internet), geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information.

_**B) Cookies, Beacons, Local Storage and Other Similar Technologies.**_ We use "cookies," Web beacons, tags and scripts, and other similar technologies including local storage objects such as HTML5. These technologies allow us to manage access to and use of the NYT Services, recognize you and provide personalization, and help us understand how people use the NYT Services. You will not be able to access certain areas of our websites, including NYTimes.com, if your computer does not accept cookies from us. Because there is no accepted standard on how to respond to “do not track” browser-based signals, we do not respond to such signals. For more detailed information about our use of cookies and local storage, and how to manage them for the applicable NYT Service, see the applicable Cookie Policy [here](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription/dg-cookie-policy/cookie-policy.html).

We transmit website usage information to third parties in order to show you advertising for The New York Times when you visit other sites.

_**C) Analytics, Log Files and Reading History.**_ As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.

**_D) Location Information._**  Some of our mobile applications can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature of the app, for example, by use of satellite, cell phone tower, or WiFi signals. If you enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the app. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an app does not have that feature, the app will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information. The ads in our apps are not targeted to you based on your current GPS location, but they are targeted to you based on your ZIP code or device's IP address.

**5\. Third-Party Advertising**

Some of the services and advertisements included in the NYT Services, including on NYTimes.com and within our mobile apps, are delivered or served by third-party companies, which may collect information about your use of the NYT Services.

These companies place or recognize cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about our NYT Services website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the NYT Services. For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device’s unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.

We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.

For example, we use Google to serve advertisements on the NYT Services, which use the Google Doubleclick cookie, and in some cases, a unique device identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to NYTimes.com and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the Google Doubleclick cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](https://adssettings.google.com/). If you would like more information about this practice, and to learn how to opt out of it in desktop and mobile browsers on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit <http://optout.aboutads.info/#/> and <http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#>. You may download the AppChoices app at<http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices> to opt out in mobile apps.
