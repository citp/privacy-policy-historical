We also participate in the Council of Better Business Bureaus' BBB _OnLine_ Privacy Program, and comply with all BBB _OnLine_ Privacy standards. 

When you visit a Web site displaying the [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/) trustmark, you can expect to be notified of what personally identifiable information of yours is collected; what organization is collecting the information; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; what kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company’s control; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to The New York Times on the Web [Customer Service](http://www.nytimes.com/info/help/formh.html); if the Web site has not responded to your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/watchdog.html). 

The New York Times on the Web has adopted a set of information management guidelines which serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships. These guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. Any such changes will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practices with respect to the use of personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and registered users will be notified via e-mail.

Subscribers who do not accept cookies from the domain "nytimes.com" cannot access most areas of The New York Times on the Web. For detailed information about our use of cookies see [Frequently Asked Questions About Cookies](http://www.nytimes.com/membercenter/faq/cookies.html) in the Site Help area of our Member Center.

All data collected by Omniture on behalf of The New York Times on the Web is owned and used by The New York Times on the Web. The New York Times on the Web reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Web site visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)** : We use a proprietary advertising serving system to display ads on our site. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third party advertising companies to serve ads onto our Web site, and in these instances may use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags) to help better manage advertising on our site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about the online movements of Web users. For instance, advertisers may place a clear gif allowing them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Please keep in mind we do not have access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor additional information they may be tied to by the advertiser.

******Children's Guidelines: The Learning Network ** [ ](https://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.nytimes.com/learning)

[The Learning Network](http://www.nytimes.com/learning) is a free service for parents, teachers and students, and does not require registration. The [Student Connections](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/index.html) section is specifically directed at students, grades 6 to 12; within this section, the [Ask a Reporter](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/ask_reporters/index.html) page, and the [Student Letters](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/letters.html) page allow students to either send a question to a Times reporter or submit a "letter to the editor," providing their first name, grade, school and state/country and optionally their e-mail address. The information requested on these pages is used solely for participation in these activities, and is not shared or sold to third parties. Access to the above services is not conditioned on more information than is reasonably necessary to provide the services. Because we’re concerned about a Parent’s right to consent to the collection and use of their child’s personal information, when a question or letter is published, only the student's first name, grade, and state/country appear on the site. To request removal of this information (non-personally identifiable) or to review or remove the optional e-mail address (personal information collected), please use [this form](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/feedback/index.html) to contact the Learning Network. 

These Childrens’ guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. In the unlikely event of such changes they will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practices with respect to the use of children’s personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and will not affect children’s personal information previously collected. 

For any questions concerning The Learning Network, please contact: Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times on the Web, 500 7th Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10018. Telephone: 646 698 8000
