The New York Times on the Web has adopted a set of information management guidelines which serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships. These guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. Any such changes will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practices with respect to the use of personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and registered users will be notified via email. 

The New York Times on the Web is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of Web sites to which it may link. 

  
**What information does The New York Times on the Web gather/track about you?**

**Registration** : During a [free registration](http://www.nytimes.com/auth/login) process prior to using the site, The New York Times on the Web requires that you supply a unique member ID, e-mail address, and demographic information (country, zip code, age, sex; household income, industry, job title, job function, and subscription status to The New York Times newspaper). You must agree to the terms of our [Subscriber Agreement](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/agree.html). 

**Premium Products and Services** : While the majority of The New York Times on the Web is offered free of charge, we do charge fees for select premium products and services. These products include our Premium Archive, Premium Crosswords, Editors’ Picks, Topics of The Times, among others. To enable the purchase of these products, The New York Times on the Web collects and stores billing and credit card information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments. You may review and update your Premium Account information, view your most recently purchased products and transaction history in the secured Premium Account area of the Member Center. 

**Contests, Surveys, Special Offers** : On occasion, The New York Times on the Web also collects additional personal information from subscribers in connection with optional contests, surveys, or special offers. Typically, this information is only shared in aggregate unless we have given you choice. 

**Cookies** :  The New York Times on the Web employs cookies to recognize you and your access privileges on The New York Times on the Web, as well as to track site usage. Subscribers who do not accept cookies from the domain "nytimes.com" cannot access most areas of The Times on the Web. For detailed information about our use of cookies see [Frequently Asked Questions About Cookies](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/cookiesfaq.html) in the Site Help area of our Member Center. 

We use a proprietary advertising server to display ads on our site. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our website. Please [click here](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/privacyinformation2.html) to see a list of these advertising agencies and their privacy policies. In the course of serving these advertisements, the third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain. If you would like more information about this practice and about your option not to accept cookies placed by these companies, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)** : We use a proprietary advertising serving system to display ads on our site. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third party advertising companies to serve ads onto our website, and in these instances may use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags) to help better manage advertising on our site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about the online movements of Web users. For instance, advertisers may place a clear gif allowing them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Please keep in mind we do not have access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor additional information they may be tied to by the advertiser.

** Children's Guidelines: The Learning Network  **

[The Learning Network](http://www.nytimes.com/learning) is a free service for parents, teachers and students, and does not require registration. The [Student Connections](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/index.html) section is specifically directed at students, grades 6 to 12; within this section, the [Ask a Reporter](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/ask_reporters/index.html) page, and the [Student Letters](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/letters.html) page allow students to either send a question to a Times reporter or submit a "letter to the editor," providing their first name, grade, school and state/country and optionally their e-mail address. The information requested on these pages is used solely for participation in these activities, and is not shared or sold to third parties. Access to the above services is not conditioned on more information than is reasonably necessary to provide the services. Because we’re concerned about a Parent’s right to consent to the collection and use of their child’s personal information, when a question or letter is published, only the student's first name, grade, and state/country appear on the site. To request removal of this information (non-personally identifiable) or to review or remove the optional e-mail address (personal information collected), please contact: [Learning@nytimes.com](mailto:learning@nytimes.com?Subject=Privacy)

These Childrens’ guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. In the unlikely event of such changes they will be posted on this page. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practices with respect to the use of children’s personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect and will not affect children’s personal information previously collected. 

For any questions concerning The Learning Network, please contact: Rebecca DuMoulin, The New York Times on the Web, 500 7th Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10018. Telephone: 646 698 8000
