## Data Security

The Department takes reasonable measures to help protect its websites and applications and the information within them from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

If you receive or create a password when registering for any of our applications, you should not divulge this password to anyone. We will never ask for your password in a telephone call, fax, e-mail or other form of unsolicited communication. When you are finished with an application, you should sign out of the application. If the browser you used to access the application is publicly accessible (such as on a computer at a public library or internet cafe), you should close the browser session and, if possible, clear any browser history, cookies, or other areas where your password might have been stored. Otherwise, you risk having information about you becoming available to third parties.

### Account Information

You can update your account information at any time by logging into the application and modifying your personal profile. If you wish to delete or suspend your account, you must contact us at [accountinfo@schools.nyc.gov](mailto:accountinfo@schools.nyc.gov).

### Cookies

Cookies are computer files that enable an application or website to distinguish between users. We use "temporary cookies" on some parts of our sites and applications, which expire when you close the browser session. We may also use “persistent cookies” to understand the how people access and use our sites and applications.

You can customize most browsers to reject cookies, to accept or reject cookies after a visual warning, or to delete cookies. However, some application and website features may require cookies to function properly.

### Web Bugs

We do not use web bugs (also known as “web beacons”) on our web pages or in email for any purposes other than:

  * to identify site performance needs;
  * to ensure compatibility with the technology used by site visitors; and
  * to add and improve services offered by our applications.
