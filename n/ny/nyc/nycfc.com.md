**a. What is a cookie?**  
A cookie is a small file of data, often incorporating a unique identifier, that is sent to your computer or mobile phone browser from a website's computer. This data file stores the information you provide us with and in doing so enables us to 'remember' you on repeat visit, effectively letting you move around the site without having to keep reintroducing yourself. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can set your browser to prevent this. If your browser’s preferences allow it, each website or third party service provider is able to send a cookie to your browser. However, to protect your privacy, your browser only allows these websites or third party service providers to access cookies already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites or other third party service providers. 

Cookies record information about your online preferences, which are then used to tailor the NYCFC website to your individual preferences. You can set your devices to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time.
