INTRODUCTION

</p>
<p>
Thank you for visiting the New York State Unified Court System’s
(UCS) web site at
<a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/">
www.courts.state.ny.us
</a>
.
This web site is designed to make it easier and more efficient for the public
to interact with the UCS. The UCS recognizes that it is critical for members
of the public to be confident that their privacy is protected when they visit
the UCS web site and that they are aware of any possible uses of personal information.
</p>
<p>
Consistent with the provisions of the New York State Internet
Security and Privacy Act, State Technology Law 201 et. seq., this policy describes
the UCS’s practices regarding information collected from users of this

is used. Because this privacy policy applies only to this web site, you should
examine the privacy policy of other web sites that you access using links from

The UCS does not collect any personal information about

INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY WHEN
YOU VISIT THIS WEB SITE
</b>
</p>
<p>
When you visit this web site, the UCS automatically collects
and stores the following information about your visit:
</p>
<p>
(i) The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used, but
not the e-mail address. The Internet Protocol Address is a numerical identifier
assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer;
</p>
<p>
(ii) The type of browser and operating system you used;
</p>
<p>
(iii) The date and time you visit this site;
</p>
<p>
(iv) The web pages or services you accessed at this site;
</p>
<p>
(v) The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site;
</p>
<p>
(vi) The web site you visit as you leave this web site; and
</p>
<p>
(vii) Any form or information that you downloaded.
</p>
<p>
None of the foregoing information is deemed to constitute personal
information.
</p>
<p>
The information that is collected automatically is used to
improve this web site’s content and to help the UCS understand how users
are interacting with the web site. This information is collected for statistical
analysis, to determine what information is of most and least interest to users
of the site and to improve the utility of the material available on the web
site. This information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes, and
the UCS is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose the information collected
from the web site for commercial purposes.

INFORMATION COLLECTED WHEN YOU E-MAIL THIS
WEB SITE OR INITIATE AN ONLINE TRANSACTION
</b>
</p>
<p>
During your visit to this web site you may send an e-mail to
the UCS. Your e-mail address and the contents of your message will be collected.
The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include
audio, video and graphic information formats included in the message. Your e-mail
address and the information included in your message will be used to respond
to you, to address issues you identify, to improve this web site, or, where
appropriate, to forward your message to another public agency for follow-up.
Your e-mail address is not collected for commercial purposes, and the UCS is
not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose your e-mail address for commercial
purposes.
</p>
During your
visit to this web site you may initiate a transaction such as a survey, registration
or order. The information, including personal information, volunteered by you
in initiating the transaction is used by the UCS to operate UCS programs, which
may include the provision of goods, services and information. The information
collected by the UCS may be disclosed by the UCS for those purposes that may be
reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in connection
with which the information was submitted. (For example, responses to a survey
regarding the operation of the UCS web site may be used to improve services offered
on the web site.) Except for ongoing voluntary transactions, the UCS does not
store information that allows the web site to recognize users when they visit
the web site again.
<p>
The UCS, in general,
does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles
of children through this web site. To the extent that UCS provides the opportunity
for children to e-mail questions or comments, the UCS does not share the information
received with third parties or create profiles of children using such information.
Users are cautioned, however, that, other than in a special program directed
at questions and comments by children, the collection of personal information
submitted in an e-mail will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult,
and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to
public access. The UCS strongly encourages parents, guardians, and teachers
to be involved in children’s Internet activities and to provide guidance
whenever children are asked to provide personal information online.

INFORMATION
AND CHOICE
</b>
</p>
<p>
As noted above,
the UCS does not collect any personal information about you during your visit
to this web site unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending
an e-mail or initiating an online transaction such as a survey, registration
or order. You may choose not to send an e-mail, respond to a survey, or complete
an order form. While your choice not to participate in these activities may
limit your ability to receive specific services, products, publications, or
information through this web site, it will not prevent you from requesting services,
products, publications, or information from UCS by other means and will not
normally have an impact on your ability to take advantage of other features
of the web site, including browsing or downloading publicly available information.

DISCLOSURE
OF INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THIS WEB SITE
</b>
</p>
<p>
The collection
of information through this web site and the disclosure of that information
are subject to the provisions of the New York State Internet Security and Privacy
Act, State Technology Law 201 et. seq. and other applicable law. The UCS will
collect personal information through this web site or disclose personal information
collected through this web site only if the user has consented to the collection

or disclosure of such personal information. The voluntary disclosure of personal
information to the UCS by the user, whether solicited or unsolicited, constitutes
consent to the collection and disclosure of the information by the UCS for the
purposes for which the user disclosed the information to the UCS, as reasonably
ascertainable from the nature and terms of the disclosure.
</p>
<p>
For example,
the use of the UCS Case Trac and Filing by Electronic Means services involves
the voluntary provision of personal information for billing and other purposes.
UCS does not sell or give this information to anyone. The UCS may, however,
use the information collected in connection with Case Trac, Filing by Electronic
Means and similar services internally to market other UCS products and services.
</p>
<p>
However, the UCS
may collect or disclose personal information without user consent if the collection
or disclosure is: (1) necessary to perform the statutory duties of the UCS,
or necessary for the UCS to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized
by state or federal statute or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order
or by law; (3) for the purpose of validating the identity of the user; or (4)
of information to be used solely for statistical purposes that is in a form
that cannot be used to identify any particular person.
</p>
<p>
The UCS may disclose
personal information to federal or state law enforcement authorities in the
course of officially authorized law enforcement investigations or to enforce
the UCS’s rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized
access to the UCS’s information technology assets (for example, to protect
against hackers).

CONFIDENTIALITY
AND INTEGRITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THIS WEB SITE

The UCS is strongly
committed to protecting personal information collected through this web site

</p>
<p>
In addition,

technology assets, including but not limited to, authentication, monitoring,
auditing, and encryption. These security procedures have been integrated into
the design, implementation, and day-to-day operations of this web site as part
of a continuing commitment to the security of electronic content as well as
the electronic transmission of information.

<p>
For web site security
purposes and to maintain the availability of the web site for all users, the
