**COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA**  
"Personal data" refers to any information relating to an identifiable individual or his or her personal identity. 

Personal data is collected on our website by LiquidNet US LLC., a US company headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Much of the data collected is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services, and is not linked to any personal data, but to the extent it is itself personal data, or is linked or linkable to personal data, we treat it accordingly.

We collect personal information from you only when: 

  1. we need your personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the services you have requested), or,

  2. the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights; 




We have a legitimate interest in operating our services and communicating with you as necessary to provide these services, for example when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. 

Please note that in most cases, if you do not submit the requested information, NTC Hosting will not be able to provide the requested service to you. 

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you, or may otherwise need that information to protect your vital interests or those of some other person's. 

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

To do so, we use technical security measures to prevent the loss, misuse, alternation or unauthorized disclosure of information under our control. We use security measures including and not limited to: physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, please keep in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

**YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)**

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following data protection rights:

_Managing Your Information_  
You may access and update some of your information through the "Change Contact Details" section in the WHCP. If you have chosen to connect your account to a third-party application like Facebook, Google or Twitter, you can change your settings and remove permission for the app from the "Linked Social Accounts" section in the WHCP. You are responsible for keeping your personal information up to date.

_Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information_  
You have the right to ask us to correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you if you cannot update it yourself from within your account.

_Data Access and Portability_  
In some jurisdictions, the applicable law may entitle you to request copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).

_Opt-out of marketing communications_  
You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing emails we send you.

_Data Retention and Erasure_  
We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information to provide the contracted services to you, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your account. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:

  * We may retain some of your personal information so as to detect and prevent fraud and enhance safety. For example, if we suspend an account for security reasons, we may retain certain information from that account to prevent that customer from opening a new account in the future.

  * We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, we may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing purposes.

  * Because we maintain our platform to protect it from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.




In cases where fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity has been deemed to have occurred as determined by law enforcement or management, the information may remain in our database indefinitely in order to help facilitate the prevention of repeated abuse in the future from the offending party.

_Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing_  
If you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information, you may withdraw it at any time by sending us a communication specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing and pending the verification whether the NTC Hosting's legitimate grounds override your own.

_Objection to Processing_  
In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require us not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing, we will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. 

By default, customers do receive any system updates, such as the newsletters, invoices and service email notifications. Customers cannot opt out of possibly receiving important system notifications, since the latter are deemed necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations to you.

_Lodging Complaints_  
If you want to make a complaint about the way we are processing your data, you can contact us using the contact details below. 

You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. 

\---

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

 **INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT**  
We collect information globally and primarily store that information in the United States. We transfer, process and store your information outside of your country of residence. Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps to protect it. 

To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information to the United States and allow access to that information from countries in which we and associated companies have operations for the purposes described in this policy. These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws, certainly not equivalent to the laws of many of the countries where our customers and users are based. When we share information about you, we make use of standard contractual data protection clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission. 

A copy of your personal data will also be stored in the data center you have selected when signing up for our services. This is done so that NTC Hosting can deliver the contracted service in the location specified by the customer.

**COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT**  
NTC Hosting cooperates with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about Users upon valid request by government or law officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect your property and rights, or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or stop activity we consider illegal or unethical.

**CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY**  
Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be placed here and will supersede this version of our Policy. We will take reasonable steps to draw your attention to any changes in our Policy. However, to be on the safe side, we suggest that you read this document each time you use the website to ensure that it still meets with your approval.
