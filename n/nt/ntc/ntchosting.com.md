## PRIVACY OF YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS

We use encrypted SSL connection to process your credit card information and DO NOT store any of your payment details in our system.

Working with the two leaders in online payment operations, we guarantee fast and secure processing of your payment. Not only do we NOT make a record of your credit card details in our system, but also - for maximum online security - we do NOT share this information with any third party.
