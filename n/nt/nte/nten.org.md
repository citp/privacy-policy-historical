## Privacy Policy fo **r nten.org**  

 **What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information:**  
Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, e-mail address, address, interests, and similar information.

  * We do not store sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card or social security numbers.

**Use by NTEN:**

When you create an account with NTEN you may receive occasional emails from us updating you on noteworthy developments in nonprofit technology. If you do not wish to hear from us, simply use the unsubscribe feature on these emails and/or contact us directly.

**Security:**

All information provided to NTEN is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of NTEN. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.

**Other Web Sites:**

Our Site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another Web site for which NTEN has no responsibility. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such sites as their policies may be different than ours.

**Member Directory:**

NTEN maintains a member directory for the purpose of helping members of our community connect with one another. If you are a current NTEN member, other current NTEN members have access to the complete directory which includes your name, organization, mailing address, phone, fax, and email address. If you do not want to be included in the member directory, you may [email us](mailto:holly@nten.org) and ask to be removed.

**Conference Privacy:**

Registrants will be included in the list of conference attendees that will be distributed to conference attendees in a hard copy format. The purpose of this list is to encourage networking and individual follow up. This list is not to be used for unsolicited commercial or bulk-email purposes. The information on the list will be limited to name, title, organization, address, phone, fax, email, city, and state. If you wish not to be included in this list, [email us](mailto:holly@nten.org)[](mailto:holly@nten.org).

If you choose to opt-in during registration, your information will also be shared with conference sponsors and/or exhibitors upon request in soft-copy format for a limited, one-time email and one-time snail mailing prior to and after the conference. Please report any violations of this one-time use policy [us](mailto:holly@nten.org).
