**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, Ntoing collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.Ntoing’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ntoing s visitors use its website.
