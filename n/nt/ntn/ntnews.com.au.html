    <div class="wide-content">
      <p>The <strong>NT News</strong> (NTN) recognises the  importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information  collected about our customers. For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, the  word <em>customers</em> includes visitors to  our web sites, subscribers to and users of our services, purchasers of our  products and advertising customers. </p>
      <p>We  are bound by the National Privacy Principles in the <em>Privacy Act 1988 </em>(Cth) in relation to the handling of personal  information. Where appropriate we will handle personal information relying on  the media exemption (but complying with the Australian Press Council Privacy  Standards), related bodies corporate exemption and the employee exemption in  the Privacy Act.</p>
      <h2>Personal Information </h2>
      <p>We  collect personal information when we provide our services to you. Generally we  will tell you why we are collecting information when we collect it and how we  plan to use it or these things will be obvious when we collect the information.  We usually collect personal information directly from you although sometimes we  may use agents or service providers to do this for us. We may also acquire  lists from other sources, both from other companies and from other public  documents. We may automatically collect personal information by collecting and  tracking the unique device identifier or the universally unique identifier of  the devices you use to access our services. </p>
      <h2>Use of Information </h2>
      <p>We  usually collect personal information such as your name, address, telephone number,  and in some instances, your financial details. When you are online, we collect  information regarding the pages within our network which you visit and what you  click on. As a general rule we do not collect sensitive information. However,  if we do, it will usually be for the purposes of providing our goods or services and if the law requires us to,  we will seek your consent to collect it. </p>
      <p>We use your information to  provide our services (which on digital platforms may include the display of  personalised content and advertising) to you, to fulfil administrative  functions associated with these services, for example billing, to enter into  contracts with you or third parties and for marketing and client relationship  purposes. Where your personal information is contained within an advertisement  which we  publish for you, we may also use your information for publication of that same  advertisement in other media, in accordance with the terms and conditions of  the initial publication.<strong></strong></p>
      <p>We may share your  information with other companies which are related to News Limited within or  outside of Australia.  We or they may also use your personally identifiable information to assist us  in improving our products and services and any of us might be in touch to let  you know about goods, services, or promotions which may interest you. </p>
      <p>We may disclose  your personal information in order to comply with Australian or foreign law.</p>
      <h2>Use by Third Parties </h2>
      <p>NTN  may disclose your information to its service providers (including technical  infrastructure providers) and contractors (including mail houses or debt  collection agencies) from time to time but only to help us to provide and  market our goods and services to you. We may also share your information with  third parties who provide prizes for competitions or reader offers. If we do any  of these, we generally require the third parties to protect your information at  least to the same degree that we do. </p>
      <p>If  you have consented to us doing so, NTN may also share your information with a  third party for the purpose of enabling those third parties to contact you with  marketing messages. </p>
      <h2>Use of Aggregate Data </h2>
      <p>We  may collect and use certain non-personal information (e.g., the identity of  your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address  and the domain name of your Internet service provider) to optimise our goods  and services (which on digital platforms  may include the display of personalised content and advertising) including our Web pages for  your computer. We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes,  including but not limited to improving the content of our sites. </p>
      <p>NTN  may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve our  goods and services including our Web sites and make them more responsive to the  needs of our customers. This statistical compilation and analysis of  information may also be used by NTN or provided to others as a summary report  for marketing, advertising or research purposes. </p>
      <h2>Security </h2>
      <p>NTN  strives to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally  identifiable information of our customers. We use a variety of physical and  electronic security measures including restricting physical access to our  offices and firewalls and secure databases to keep personal information secure  from misuse, loss or unauthorised use or disclosure.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately,  no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. </p>
      <h2>Access to Personal Information </h2>
      <p>You  have a right to access most personal information we hold about you and if we  deny access in some circumstances we will tell you why. </p>
      <p>To  request access, please contact our privacy officer as set out at the end of  this document. </p>
      <h2>Public Information </h2>
      <p>Any  information posted on bulletin boards and/or communicated in chat areas becomes  public information. While NTN strives to protect and respect your privacy, we  cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in a chat room or  bulletin board. </p>
      <h2>Cookies </h2>
      <p>Cookies  are data that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for  record-keeping purposes. Cookies can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and  use of a site. They allow us to track usage patterns and to compile data that  can help us improve our content and target advertising. If you do not want  information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure  in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature. But you  should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide you with features such as  merchandise transactions or registered services. </p>
      <h2>Online Links to Third Party and Co-Branded Sites </h2>
      <p>NTN  may establish relationships with business partners that allow visitors to our  Internet sites to link directly to sites operated by these partners. Some of  these sites may be "co-branded" with our logo; however, these sites  may not be operated or maintained by or on our behalf. These sites may collect  personal information from you that may be shared with us. This Privacy  Statement will apply to any personal information we obtain in this manner. </p>
      <p>NTN  is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated by third  parties that are linked to our sites. These links are meant for the user's  convenience only. Links to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship,  endorsement or approval by NTN of the content, policies or practices of those  third party sites. Once you have left our site via such a link, you should  check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. </p>
      <h2>What else you should know about privacy on the internet </h2>
      <p>Remember  to close your browser when you have finished your user session. This is to  ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence  if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public  place like a library or Internet café. You as an individual are responsible for  the security of and access to your own computer.</p>
      <p>Whenever  you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet that this  information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal  information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive unsolicited  messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible  for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and any account  information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the  internet.</p>
      <h2>For further information </h2>
      <p>Please  contact our Privacy Officer to ask for access to your information or if you  have a complaint concerning your information privacy or if you would like more  information about our approach to privacy. </p>
