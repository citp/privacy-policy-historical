  * **User Information Collection and Use.**

**1\. Information Collection.** TBC Corporation collects information from users of our websites at several different points, including without limitation when a user:  
**a.** Places an order or requests product or service information on-line from TBC Corporation.  
**b.** Registers on one of TBC Corporation's websites.  
**c.** Requests notification of an on-line order's status using a TBC Corporation website.  
**d.** Participates in an on-line sweepstakes or survey.   
**e.** Applies for a credit card through TBC Corporation or the user provides existing credit card information to TBC Corporation on-line in connection with a product or service order.  
**f.** Submits an e-mail address for use by TBC Corporation.  
**g.** Subscribes to receive e-mail from TBC Corporation.   
**h.** Participates in a click to chat/live chat session. 

TBC Corporation's primary goal in collecting any information that personally identifies a user is to fulfill website user requests and orders. A website user may be asked to provide contact and/or credit card information in connection with an order. If we have trouble processing an order or request, completing delivery of an order or other similar issue, this contact information will be used by TBC Corporation or a third party working on our behalf to contact the user. 

TBC Corporation’s websites may retain information from any participant in a click to chat/live chat session. By participating in a click to chat/live chat session, you are agreeing that TBC and any Agent representing or working on behalf of TBC can record and/or retain your information. Information provided to click to chat/live chat participants is informational only and should not be relied on as the sole basis for making a decision. TBC and its subsidiaries and/or affiliates are not liable for any information provided and/or the consequences thereof via a click to chat/live chat session.

A user of the click to chat/live chat should not provide personally identifiable information (such as date of birth, social security number, credit card number, etc.) on the click to chat/live chat system. Any user who does so hereby does so at his or her own risk and agrees to release TBC Corporation and its subsidiaries and/or affiliates from any liability, damages, or causes of action relating thereto. 

You may choose not to provide us with any personally-identifying information. In that case, you can still access and use many portions of our websites; however, you will not be able to access and use those portions of any TBC Corporation website that requires your personal information. 

    * **Important Website Terminology.**

**a. Cookies.** "Cookies" are small, removable pieces of data that are stored by a user's Internet browser on a user's computer when a TBC Corporation website is accessed that enables us to track and personalize our websites to enhance each user's website experience. For instance, by installing a cookie from one of our websites, we can provide you with storage of items in your shopping cart between visits. Most web browsers allow you to exercise control over cookies installed on your computer. You may erase them, block them or have notifications sent to you when a cookie is stored on your computer. However, if a user's browser refuses the cookie, some of the features and services of TBC Corporation's websites may not operate to their fullest or properly.   
**b. Anonymous Data.** We collect “"anonymous data" when you visit most pages on TBC Corporation's websites. Anonymous data is general information about your contact, but does not personally identify you or connect a particular use to you. Your visit does provide us with useful data, but it will not be linked to your personal information, such as your IP (Internet Protocol) address, browser type, operating system, domain name, access times and referring website addresses. Some parts of TBC Corporation's websites use embedded pixel or JavaScript technologies to facilitate your use of the website and to track general traffic. We use anonymous data to obtain general statistics regarding the use of TBC Corporation's websites and its specific web pages and to evaluate how our visitors use and navigate our websites on an aggregate basis. We simply do not link anonymous data, including yours, with any personal data or information.

              * **Special Offers, Account Updates and Opting Out.**

TBC Corporation occasionally sends our customers and the users of our websites announcements and updates, which contain important information about our websites and our product and service offerings, including those from its Affiliated Companies, which we believe to be of value to our customers and users. To facilitate this, we may enhance or merge the information we collect on our websites with data lawfully obtained from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to our customers and users.   
We may communicate with the users of our websites via e-mail, telephone, mail or fax to provide services, content, product information, notification of offers, discounts or in regard to customer service issues relating to a particular account. The users of our websites are given the opportunity to elect not to receive such marketing communications. 

                * **Unsubscribe Option.**

Our e-mail messages have an "unsubscribe" feature for prior users of our websites who have become our customers, but do not want to be notified about special offers in the future. At any time, users can "reply" back to the e-mail message and type "unsubscribe" in the subject field. We will remove that e-mail address from our e-mail lists. To ensure proper updating of account information, users with more than one e-mail address are asked to include those in any "unsubscribe" request. Users who do not wish to have postal mail information, phone number or ordering information shared with third party organizations, can opt out by: (i) calling us toll-free at 1-800-639-8473; (ii) mail us at TBC Corporation, Attn: Web & eCommerce Privacy, 4300 TBC Way, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410, or (iii) e-mail us at service@tbccentral.com.
