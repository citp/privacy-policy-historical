      <font face="arial, sans-serif, geneva, verdana" size="2">NTB.com values 
      the trust its customers place in the company. We want to ensure that you 
      understand what information we gather about you, how we use it, and the 
      safeguards we have in place in order to protect it. NTB.com may update this policy from time to time. 
      Please check the policy periodically for changes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How does NTB.com ensure that your customer information is secure?</b><br>
      NTB.com will maintain practices and procedures designed to ensure the 
      security, integrity and confidentiality of customer information. We 
      restrict and limit access to customer information only to those employees 
      who need it to carry out their business functions, and educate our 
      employees about safeguarding customer information and preventing its 
      unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. When credit card information is 
      transmitted online, NTB.com uses industry standard security measures 
      called SSL (secure socket layer encryption). NTB.com will monitor and 
      adopt, as appropriate, new technological improvements that are designed to 
      aid in ensuring the accuracy and security of customer information.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What type of information does NTB.com collect?</b><br>
      NTB.com gathers customer information needed to provide superior service, 
      to communicate offers on merchandise and services that we believe will be 
      of interest to you, and to administer our business. In order to best serve 
      you, we may gather information from you in a few instances.<br>
      <br>
      First, when you visit our site, we may collect non-personally identifiable 
      information from you. Through the use of computer "cookies" we collect 
      data, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, and specific 
      NTB.com web pages through which you click. This data is collected 
      automatically and utilized in aggregate to help us look for trends so that 
      we can improve our web site and your NTB.com experience. Additional 
      information regarding computer cookies and how to disable them is 
      described below.<br>
      <br>
      Second, in a few circumstances, we may ask you to voluntarily provide 
      information such as your name, telephone number, and e-mail address. This 
      type of information may be provided when you become a member of NTB.com 
      and it allows us to send you certain promotions and coupon offers. Other 
      examples of when we may ask you to voluntarily provide personally 
      identifiable information include if you subscribe to our email program, 
      choose to provide us preference information, or when you enter one of our 
      promotions.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, in order to provide you with goods and services designed to 
      meet your needs, we may collect demographic information (such as number of 
      household members, age, and gender), purchase preference information, and 
      mailing lists from third parties. We use this information to customize 
      your experience on our web site and to provide you with the most relevant 
      products and services.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What information do we share and with whom?</b><br>
      NTB.com does not rent or sell customer information to outside marketers. 
      We may share your information (as described above) with members of the 
      National Tire &amp; Battery® family of businesses to provide you with products 
      or services that you have requested or to provide you with promotional 
      offers that we believe will be of interest to you. The NTB family of 
      businesses include all NTB affiliates as well as other selected businesses 
      with which National Tire &amp; Battery has a relationship and which have 
      agreed to adhere to our strict standards for providing quality products 
      and services, responding to your needs, and protecting customer 
      information.<br>
      <br>
      In certain circumstances, NTB.com may share your customer information with 
      trusted service providers that need access to your information to provide 
      operational or other support services. To ensure the confidentiality and 
      security of your information, service providers must agree to safeguard 
      your information in strict compliance with our policy. Additionally, when 
      you apply online for a National Tire &amp; Battery credit card, we may share 
      information about your application with credit bureaus. We also may 
      provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement 
      officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise believe 
      in good faith that the law requires it. In the event of a sale of all or 
      part of one of our businesses, we may share customer information related 
      to that business as part of the transaction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Does NTB.com use cookies?</b><br>
      "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by the browser 
      on your hard drive. NTB.com may store some information on the visitor's 
      computer in the form of a cookie or similar file. The cookies that are 
      configured by us do not contain any personally identifying information, 
      such as your name, or sensitive information, such as your credit card 
      number. The cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to our site 
      and to provide you with a customized experience that we feel will be of 
      value to you. For example, these files allow us to tailor your NTB.com 
      experience to reflect your expressed interests and preferences.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Can I disable cookies?</b><br>
      Most web browsers allow you to exercise control over cookie files on your 
      computer by erasing them, blocking them, or notifying you when such a file 
      is stored. Please take a look at your particular browser for instructions 
      on this function. If you do elect to disable the NTB.com cookie, please 
      note that you may not be able to take full advantage of a personalized 
      experience at NTB.com.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Can I "opt out" of receiving promotional emails from NTB.com?</b><br>
      NTB.com may send you emails with promotional offers only if you opt-in to 
      receiving such emails. If you would no longer like to receive emails about 
      new merchandise, special events and promotions or new information and 
      other messages from NTB.com, please click
      <b>here</b> and follow the "Unsubscribe" instructions. Your email 
      address will be removed from our email subscription list. <br>
      <br>
      <b>How can I update or correct personal information given to NTB.com?</b><br>
      NTB believes you should have the ability to access and correct the 
      personal information that you provide to us. By accessing the "My NTB Log 
      In" area of our site, you can review, change, or delete information about 
      your membership profile that you have submitted and which is stored at 
      NTB.com. We encourage you to promptly update your information if it 
      changes, so we can keep our records current. As a security measure, to 
      help ensure the integrity of our customer information, and to comply with 
      certain legal requirements, NTB.com routinely "backs up" customer-specific 
      and transactional data stored on our systems. As a result, certain current 
      and prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases. 
      Accordingly, you should not expect that all of your personally 
      identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases, 
      even if you delete all of your current personal information from your 
      membership profile.
