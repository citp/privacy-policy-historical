# Email Privacy Policy

Email Privacy Policy
We have created this email privacy policy as a firm commitment to your privacy and the
protection of your information.
Why did you receive an email from us?
If you received an email from us, (a) your email address is either listed with us as someone who
has expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the future ("opt-
in"), or (b) you have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing relationship with us
or an affiliate. We respect your time and attention by controlling the frequency of our mailings.
How we protect your privacy
We use security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data maintained
and used by our system.
Sharing and Usage
We will not share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone without your
advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only
available to our employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or
sending you emails based on your request for information and to contracted service providers
for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you.
How can you stop receiving email from us?
Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving email from us, or
to change your expressed interests. If you wish to do this, please follow the instructions at the
end of any email.
If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via our system or purporting to be sent
via our system, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to
info@ntknetwork.com for review.
