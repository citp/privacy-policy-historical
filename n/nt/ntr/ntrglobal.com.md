“ **Employee** ” means an employee (whether temporary, permanent, part-time, or contract),  or independent contractor, or job applicant of ASG or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.

“ **Europe** ” or “ **European** ” refers to a country in the European Union or the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
