Privacy Policy

NFLSHOP.com believes in keeping your confidential information confidential. With this in mind, we have adopted the privacy policy described below: 

**Registration**

We encourage you to register when shopping at the NFLSHOP.com site, however, it is not required. Our registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name, age range, password, and e-mail address). You must be 13 years of age or older to register. Registration helps us to provide you with an easy and personalized shopping experience, with quick and simple checkout options. The customer contact information you supply on the registration form will be used to send you e-mail NFL Newsletters and updates about upcoming sales, contests, promotions and product information. In addition, the information is used, when necessary, to contact you concerning the status of an order or to answer any of your questions. 

At all times, you have the option of "opting out" of receiving future e-mail updates by visiting our choice/opt-out form. 

If you would like, you can also fill out a customer profile. While it is not required, information obtained from the customer profile questions helps us to learn more about our customers and is used to improve our customers' shopping experience with us.

 **Order Information**

Customers use an order form to request information or products. When you place an order, we collect contact information, such as your shipping and e-mail addresses, and financial information, such as your account or credit card numbers. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about us to our customers and to get in touch with them when necessary. Financial information is used to bill the customer for products. You also have the option of ordering products over the telephone, and you may choose to pay by check. 

If you register with our Website, we can store your credit card information on file on our secure servers for your use on future orders. If you select this option, you will be able to store multiple credit card information in "My Account". You will be shown the name you selected for your card, its last four digits, and the expiration date to confirm it is the card you want to use again.  When you select this payment option, your credit card information goes over a secured server. 

**Use of Information**

NFLSHOP.com will not collect any personally identifying information, except when specifically provided by visitors to our Website. Such information includes name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. We do not sell or share any information about our users on the individual customer level. At times, we may share aggregate, or summary, information such as statistics about our customers, sales traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors. However, this information will not include any personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing Information**

We also may offer you the opportunity to purchase products and services provided by third parties, such as magazine subscriptions and credit card offers. If you purchase any of these products or services, we will provide your personal information to the third parties that provide them, but we authorize these third parties to use this information only in connection with the products and services they provide.

 **Updating of Information**

In order to change or modify information previously provided by you, please choose "My Account" and update your information using the options on this page. 

**Option to Opt-out**

You may opt-out of receiving communications from us at any time. In order to remove your information from our database, and to no longer receive communications, please visit: [Unsubscribe Options](http://www.nflshop.com/nfl/index.jsp?pageId=nflEmailUnsubscribe)

 **Security of Information**

NFLSHOP.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information you provide. We encrypt your personal information, including your credit card number, when transmitting over the Internet using triple key encryption technology by Secure Server Certification Authority RSA Data Security Inc. US and a VeriSign SSL (Secure socket Layer), to safeguard your Internet transactions. VeriSign, Inc. is a leading provider of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and digital certificate solutions used by enterprises, Websites and consumers to conduct secure communications and transactions over the Internet and private networks. 

Browsers that allow for SSL Technology Ordering from our Website require the use of an SSL-compliant browser, such as Netscape 4.0 or later; Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 or later; 5.0 AOL client for PCs; or the 5.0 AOL client for Macs. You will not be able to use Secure Mode if you have an older version of an Internet browser that does not support secure transactions, or if your computer is located on a local area network (LAN) that uses a firewall that prohibits secure transactions. If Secure Mode is not possible, please select one of our off-line options to place your order. 

**Cookies**

NFLSHOP.com does place a feature called a "cookie" on your hard drive. A cookie is a small data file that Websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit. A cookie may contain certain information, such as a unique user session ID number, which is used to track the page(s) you visited. We do not store any personally identifiable information in your cookie. This unique number allows us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site. Cookies also allow us to recognize registered users when they visit, and to provide those customers with their account information. If you register with us or order from our site, we use cookies to monitor and maintain information about how you use our site and what you buy. If you do not register or buy from the site, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our Website in a manner that does not identify you. Cookies do not allow us to collect any additional information other than the information that was provided by you at the time of registration. 

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change the configuration of your browser to prevent this from occurring. Even without a cookie, you can still take advantage of most of the features of our site, including making a purchase, but we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user. As a result, you will be unable to access (or change or delete) your account information.
