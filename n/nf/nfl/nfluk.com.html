					<br>
					Effective Date: Aug. 16, 2001
					
					<p>This privacy policy is applicable to the Website[s] accessible 
					at universal resource locators NFLUK.com, NFL.com and Superbowl.com 
					(collectively the "Site"), which is operated pursuant 
					to a strategic relationship among National Football League Enterprises, 
					L.P. on behalf of the National Football League, SportsLine.com, 
					Inc., America Online, Inc., and CBS Broadcasting, Inc. (collectively, 
					the "NFL PARTNERS", "we", "our", or 
					"us"). Note: Click here if you disclosed personally identifiable 
					information via the the NFL.com and/or Superbowl.com Web sites (individually 
					or collectively, as applicable, the "NFL Sites") prior 
					to Aug. 16, 2001. This privacy policy shall be prominently published 
					on the Site. The purpose of this privacy policy is to disclose to 
					you what information we may collect, how we may collect it, with 
					whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such 
					information, including the choices you have regarding our collection 
					of information and our use and disclosure to other parties of information 
					we may have collected from you. </p>
					<p>Please read the following to learn more about our data collection 
					policies and practices. </p>
					<p><br>
					- Types of information that may be collected <br>
					- How information may be collected <br>
					- How we use the information collected <br>

					<br>
					- Correcting/updating personal information <br>
					- TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED <br>
					- The following are the types of information we may collect: </p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">Information You Provide Us</span><br>
					Personal information such as your user ID and password, name, email 
					address, telephone number, physical address, birth date, gender 
					or zip code or other information may be collected via the Site. 
					</p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">Site Usage Information</span><br>
					We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you 
					visit the Site. For example, we may collect click-stream data and 
					your IP address. </p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">Email Communications</span><br>
					When you open emails from the Site, we may receive a confirmation 
					noting you opened an email from us, if your computer supports such 
					capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you 
					and what emails you may be receiving from the NFL PARTNERS and our 
					subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, we keep a record of what 
					emails you have opted to and not to receive. </p>
					<p>Information from Other Sources<br>
					We may receive information about you from other sources and add 
					it to your personal information. </p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED </span><br>
					We may collect information from you in several different areas on 
					the Site, including but not limited to those described below: </p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">Registration</span><br>
					You may be asked first to complete a registration form and provide 
					personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose 
					a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features 
					the Site may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, Newsletters, 
					Contests, Forums, Fantasy or other subscription based services. 
					</p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">Newsletters and Site Emails</span><br>
					We may offer free newsletters to share information with you about 
					the Site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about 
					our business partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive 
					a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or 
					in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you 
					have registered on the Site. You may cancel your free email subscription 
					by following the instructions provided on the Site or, in some instances, 
					in the designated area of certain newsletters or emails. </p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">Contests or Sweepstakes</span><br>
					We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site which may 
					require registration. Your personally identifiable information may 
					be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation 
					or other related purposes. We may ask your permission to allow us 
					to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on 
					a winners page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except 
					as required by applicable law, we will not post your information 
					without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser 
					or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Site, 
					and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the 
					operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we have no control 
					over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review 
					the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest 
					or sweepstakes before participating. </p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">Surveys or Voting</span><br>
					From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information 
					from you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary 
					and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose 
					information. At times, you may have to register to vote or to take 
					part in a survey. </p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">Cookies</span><br>
					As with many Web sites, the Site uses standard technology called 
					"cookies," which are small data files that are transferred 
					to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. 
					Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Site whenever 
					you visit the Site, and make using the Site easier for you by saving 
					your passwords, purchases, and preferences. By tracking how and 
					when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are 
					popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the 
					Site are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies 
					allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on 
					the Site. Cookies may also allow the Site to present to you advertising 
					which may be of interest to you . If you do not want information 
					collected through the use of cookies, you generally can opt out 
					of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your 
					browser; however, some areas of the Site may not provide you with 
					a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. 
					</p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">IP Addresses and Click-stream Data</span><br>
					We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes 
					of system administration and to report aggregate information to 
					our advertisers and sponsors. An IP address is a number that is 
					automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the 
					Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address. 
					When you request Web pages from the Site, our computers log your 
					IP address. </p>
					<p>Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when 
					you request Web pages from the Site. Click-stream data may include 
					such information as the page served, the time, the source of the 
					request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page 
					view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this 
					data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Site, what type 
					of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate 
					are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and 
					the like. </p>
					<p class="GenericTitle">Transaction Information </p>
					<p>If you order any information from our Site, buy any of our products 
					or subscribe for any of the services offered on our Site, we will 
					ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information 
					from you, including financial information such as a credit card 
					number and expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping 
					information. We will use this information to complete the transaction 
					that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products 
					or other services that you order, and to invoice you. Such information 
					is collected and stored through encrypted means for your protection. 
					</p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">Fantasy Games</span><br>
					When you register to play Fantasy games, you may be asked to provide 
					personally identifiable information. </p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</span><br>
					Each of the NFL PARTNERS own the information collected via this 
					Site. As applicable, the information you provide to us may be used 
					to: </p>
					<p>- contact you about the Site; <br>
					- contact you relating to your membership status; <br>
					- confirm or fulfill an order you have made; <br>
					- monitor or improve the use of the Site; <br>
					- customize the advertising and content you see; <br>
					- monitor compliance with our terms and conditions of use of the 
					Site; <br>
					- provide special offers to you from the NFL PARTNERS and/or their 
					respective affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties; 
					<br>
					- send you promotional material on behalf of our partners; <br>
					- inform you of a prize you have won. <br>
					<br>
					<span class="GenericTitle">WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED</span><br>
					At times, we may share your personally identifiable information 
					with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways 
					in which your information may be shared with others: <br>
					Agents: We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals 
					to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling 
					orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer 
					lists, Site analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, 
					processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. 
					They may have access to personally identifiable information needed 
					to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
					<br>
					Promotional Offers: We may send offers to you on behalf of other 
					partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name 
					and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you may 
					opt out in the email or change your preferences. <br>
					Aggregate Information: We may share aggregate information such as 
					demographics and Site usage statistics to advertisers, sponsors 
					or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, 
					the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable 
					information. <br>
					Opt-in and Opt-out Programs: Throughout the Site you may be presented 
					with opportunities to receive special offers from third parties. 
					An opt-in/opt-out message will ask you if you would like your information 
					to be shared. If you do choose to have your information shared, 
					in an effort to protect you, third parties who have access to personally 
					identifiable information must abide by the current Site privacy 
					policy. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices 
					of these other companies, and you should review the privacy practices 
					of such Web sites prior to providing your personally identifiable 
					information. <br>
					Third-Party Ad Serving &amp; Audience and Traffic Measurement Services: 
					The Site may use a third party network advertiser to serve the advertisements 
					on the Site or may use a traffic measurement service to analyze 
					the traffic on the Site. Network advertisers are third parties that 
					display advertisements based on your visits to this Site and other 
					Web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to 
					target advertisements to you for products or Web sites you might 
					be interested in. Audience and Traffic Measurement Services allow 
					us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from our 
					Site by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Although advertisers 
					or other companies do not have access to the Site cookies, the Site's 
					advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves 
					set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose 
					to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Cookies allow third 
					party advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might 
					be interested in. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject 
					to their own privacy policies, not this one. Please click here in 
					order to learn more about the information collection practices and 
					"opt-out" procedures of third party ad servers we may 
					use. <br>
					NFL Partners Subsidiaries and Affiliates: We may share your information 
					(including, without limitation, personally identifiable information) 
					with subsidiaries and affiliates of NFL PARTNERS. <br>
					Business Transfers: The Site or an NFL PARTNER may be sold along 
					with its assets, or other transactions may occur in which your personally 
					identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred. 
					In such a case, your personally identifiable information, which 
					we have gathered, may be one of the business assets we transfer. 
					<br>
					Legal Process: In the event we are required to respond to subpoenas, 
					court orders or other legal process your personally identifiable 
					information may be disclosed pursuant to such subpoena, court order 
					or legal process, which may be without notice to you. <br><br>
					
					<span class="GenericTitle">CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS, AND MESSAGE BOARDS</span><br>
					The Site may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available 
					to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information 
					when using these areas but you may choose to do so. If you post 
					personal information online, it will be publicly available and you 
					may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. The NFL PARTNERS 
					cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make 
					public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot 
					ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information 
					will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding 
					to disclose personal information in these areas. </p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</span><br>
					You should be aware that when you are on the Site you could be directed 
					to other sites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" 
					on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off 
					the Site onto a different Web site. This includes links from advertisers, 
					sponsors and partners that may use the Site's logo as part of a 
					co-branding agreement. These other Web sites may send their own 
					cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information 
					and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If 
					you visit a Website that is linked to our Site, you should consult 
					that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information. 
					</p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">SECURITY</span><br>
					This Site incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, 
					integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information 
					that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions 
					to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration. Your 
					personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers 
					utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access 
					to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. 
					Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required. 
					</p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS CONCERNING 
					PRIVACY</span><br>
					The Site is a general audience site. We do not currently collect 
					any personal information from children under the age of thirteen 
					on the Site. If in the future, the NFL PARTNERS collect personally 
					identifiable information from children, it will do so in compliance 
					with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 
					6501 et seq.) including, without limitation, obtaining necessary 
					parental consent. For more information about the privacy practices 
					for our affiliated children's sites such as NFLPlayFootball.com, 
					please consult the privacy policy at the children's site in which 
					you are interested. The Internet offers children wonderful educational 
					and entertainment resources. Your guidance and involvement are essential 
					to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. 
					We encourage you to visit the Direct Marketing Association's Web 
					site (www.the-dma.org) and explore the Get CyberSavvy! Program as 
					well as the GetNetWise Web site (www.getnetwise.org) to learn more 
					about parental control tools. </p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES AND YOUR ACCEPTANCE 
					OF THE PRIVACY POLICY</span><br>
					By using this Site, you signify your agreement to the terms of our 
					privacy policy. If we decide to change or update this privacy policy, 
					we will give you notice of the changes made so you can be aware 
					of such revised privacy policy. If at any point we decide to use 
					personally identifiable information in a manner different from that 
					stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by way of 
					an email or some other means. Your continued use of the Site shall 
					constitute your acceptance of such revised privacy policy. </p>
					<p><span class="GenericTitle">CORRECTING/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</span><br>
					If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your 
					zip code), or if you no longer desire to access our Site, we will 
					endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal 
					data you have provided to us. This can be done by making changes
