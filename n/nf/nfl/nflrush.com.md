The Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 requires websites that store data from users under thirteen years old to inform parents about data storage policies and obtain parental permissions. Once given, parents may revoke those permissions at any time informing us of their decision. We strictly adhere to these requirements and will make every effort to meet and exceed the requirements mandated by law. <http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.shtm>. 

### Consent

By using the Website products and/or services, you acknowledge that you have read this entire Privacy Policy and you consent to the practices described herein with respect to collection, use and disclosure of the Personal Information you and/or your child ("you") provides. 

This represents the entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. The Website the right to change this Privacy Policy in accordance with the terms herein at any time. We encourage you to visit this page often, review this Privacy Policy frequently, and remain informed about any changes to it. 

If, after review, you still have questions about any portion of this Privacy Policy, please contact us using the contact information provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. 

### Information Collection and Use

_Personal Information_

"Personal Information" means information that can identify a specific individual (including those under 13 years of age), such as your name, gender, address, phone number, e-mail address, or other contact information, whether at work or at home. Other information that we may collect, includes gender, age, first name, username and password that, in and of itself, is not personally identifiable. 

In all cases in which we collect Personal Information, we specifically describe what information is collected in order to provide you with the product, service, or feature you have requested. 

As described below, the Website, our representatives and/or subsidiaries collect Personal Information when you contact us, when parental consent is required, when you register, when you use any and all related products and services, when you submit a question or purchase products and/or services offered for sale, when you visit websites of certain NFL partners, and when you enter promotions and sweepstakes. 

We do not save any Personal Information from users under thirteen-years-old except their parent's email address. We collect an e-mail address from each user in the registration process which protects the site from spam "bots" that search out and attack unprotected registrations. Our registration process delivers an e-mail to the registering user and then immediately and permanently deletes the email address of anyone under thirteen years of age. In the case where a user contacts us via the "Contact Us" area of the Website, we will respond to this one-time email and delete any email address that is associated with a user under the age of 13. 

We may collect your geo-location information for the purpose of setting your clock for the game feed, otherwise we do not ask for, access, or track any location based information from your mobile device. 

_Registration for The Website & Mobile Applications_

In order to register, you must first complete the online registration form, which requires that you create a username and password. During registration, you are also required to provide Personal Information, such as your e-mail address, gender and birth date, so that we may contact you about the services on the site(s) in which you have expressed interest and so that we may verify your age. 

Certain functionality of the Website may require parental notice or consent for children under 13 years of age in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act. When a registrant indicates they are under 13 years of age, we will only collect first name, gender, parent's email address and birth date. Parent's of under 13 years of age users will be sent a parental notice indicating their child's wish to join the Website, information about the activities on the Website, disclosure of the information collected from the child including username and password, as well as instructions for the parent to delete membership. The full privacy policy is also included in this notice. In such instances where parental consent is needed, we will direct you to a web page explaining the procedure for obtaining parental consent.

Please note that their privacy policy governs the collection and use of data while on their site.
