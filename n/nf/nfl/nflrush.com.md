# Privacy Policy - NFLRush.com

**Updated as of August 17, 2007**

The NFLRUSH website is new and improved! We have added new games, activities and features to the site for your enjoyment and learning. Our Privacy Policy has been re-written and while it does not substantially differ from our previous Privacy Policy, we encourage you to read and understand it. Your privacy is important to us.

The owners (The National Football League Enterprises, its respective representatives and subsidiaries, on behalf of the National Football League)and producers (Brandissimo!, Inc.), collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as "we," "us" and "our," of the NFLRUSH website respect your privacy rights and recognize the importance of protecting the Personal Information (as defined below) provided by you and/or your child to the NFL and its representatives and/or subsidiaries.

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, and use the Personal Information you provide in conjunction with using NFLRUSH website through telephone or e-mail communications you may have with the NFLRUSH website, its respective representatives and/or subsidiaries.

This Privacy Policy also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of the Personal Information you and/or your child provide to the NFLRUSH website, its representatives and/or subsidiaries, and the actions that can be taken to access this information and request the information you and/or your child provides be corrected or deleted.

About the NFLRUSH Website

NFLRUSH is the NFL's website for youth. It has been built especially for those young people who are football enthusiasts or who may have an interest in football, and in NFL Football in particular. The main goal of the site is to entertain and educate young users about football in a safe environment.

As a source of information, the site focuses on news about NFL teams and players and the NFL's own Junior Player Development programs. The editors of the site intentionally avoid including news and information that are sensational, violent or negative in nature. All of our children are already inundated with and exposed to far too many of those stories and accompanying images in the mainstream media and on other sports sites. To counter this, the NFL has created NFLRUSH to provide young football fans with a refuge where they can celebrate their expanding interest in the game of football.

This site is filled with a great volume of up-to-the-minute statistics, data and information that will increase your child's understanding of the game of football, with connections to teams, player profiles that provide positive role models and inside information that will give your child a sense of mastery of the sport.

The site also delivers high-quality, football-themed, casual computer games and activities that are fun and often specifically educational, as well as contests that make the site even more exciting and vibrant for young football enthusiasts. We have tried to strike a balance between information and game play because we believe that an important part of growing up is just having fun.

## Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act Compliance

The Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 requires websites that store data from users under thirteen years old to inform parents about data storage policies and obtain parental permissions. Once given, parents may revoke those permissions at any time informing us of their decision. We strictly adhere to these requirements and will make every effort to meet and exceed the requirements mandated by law.

## Consent

By using the NFLRUSH website, or any of the affiliated or associated websites, products and/or services, you acknowledge that you have read this entire Privacy Policy and you consent to the practices described herein with respect to collection, use and disclosure of the Personal Information you and/or your child ("you") provides.

This represents the entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. The NFLRUSH website, its respective representatives and/or subsidiaries reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy in accordance with the terms herein at any time. We encourage you to visit this page often, review this Privacy Policy frequently, and remain informed about any changes to it.

If, after review, you still have questions about any portion of this Privacy Policy, please contact us using the contact information provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

 _Personal Information_  
"Personal Information" means information that can identify a specific individual, such as your name, gender, address, phone number, e-mail address, or other contact information, whether at work or at home.

In all cases in which we collect Personal Information, we specifically describe what information is collected in order to provide you with the product, service, or feature you have requested.

The NFLRUSH website, our representatives and/or subsidiaries collect Personal Information when you contact us, when you register, when you use any and all related products and services, when you submit a question or purchase products and/or services offered for sale, when you visit websites of certain NFL partners, and when you enter promotions and sweepstakes.

NFLRUSH does not save any Personal Information from users under thirteen-years-old without their parent's explicit permission. We collect an e-mail address from each user in the registration process which protects the site from spam "bots" that search out and attack unprotected registrations. Our registration process delivers an e-mail to the registering user and then immediately and permanently deletes the email address of anyone under thirteen years of age, unless a parent has provided verifiable consent to collect, use or disclose the email address. Parents of users under thirteen years of age who provide consent for NFLRush to collect, use or disclose the Personal Information of their children may request to review, change or delete the Personal Information of their children collected on the site by emailing their children's username and email address, and their request, to us at [NFLRushPrivacy@NFL.com](mailto:NFLRushPrivacy@NFL.com) or [NFLRushSafety@NFL.com](mailto:NFLRushSafety@nfl.com).

_Registration for The NFLRUSH Website_  
You are required to register in order to use selected features of the NFLRUSH website such as being able to customize your website experience.

In order to register, you must first complete the online registration form, which requires that you create a username and password. During registration, you are also required to provide Personal Information, such as your e-mail address, gender and birth date, so that we may contact you about the services on the site(s) in which you have expressed interest and so that we may verify your age.

Certain functionality of the NFLRUSH website, whether available now or in the future, may require parental consent for children under 13 years of age in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act. In such instances, we will direct you to a web page explaining the procedure for obtaining parental consent. Features of the NFLRUSH website that require parental consent for children under 13 years of age include, but are not limited to, the following:

  * Permission to use the NFLRUSH website chat functionality
  * Permission to allow us to use your personal information to market the NFLRUSH website features and products directly to you
  * Permission to use your parent's credit card for any NFLRUSH website features for which we charge a fee; for example, purchase of premium items in the site role-playing game, NFLRZ



During registration, you may also have the option to provide additional Personal Information, such as your homepage, your instant messenger handle(s) and additional e-mail addresses.

_Promotions, Contests and Sweepstakes_  
The NFLRUSH website provides you the opportunity to participate in promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes on the NFLRUSH website and through its representatives and/or subsidiaries. Such promotions, contests and sweepstakes are also governed by the rules and regulations posted with such promotions, contests and sweepstakes. You should refer to the specific games, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes for the specific rules and regulations governing them.

If you participate, you will be required to register with the NFLRUSH website, which will require you to provide certain Personal Information. Participation in these promotions, contests and sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to register and provide your Personal Information. The requested information typically includes contact information, such as name, shipping address, e-mail address, and telephone number. We will use this information to notify winners and award prizes.

Additionally, during the registration process you may be given the choice to opt-in to receiving additional related communications from the NFLRUSH website, our respective representatives and/or subsidiaries.

These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.

_Third-Party Ad Serving & Audience and Traffic Measurement Services_  
The NFLRUSH website may use a third-party "network advertiser" to serve the advertisements on the NFLRUSH website or may use an "audience traffic measurement service" to analyze the traffic on the NFLRUSH website. "Network advertisers" are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the NFLRUSH website and other websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or websites you might be interested in. "Audience and traffic measurement services" allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from the NFLRUSH website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Although advertisers or other companies do not have access to the NFLRUSH website cookies, the NFLRUSH website's advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Cookies allow third-party advertisers to show you advertisements or content you might be interested in. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the activities described above. See "Web Beacons and Other Tracking Activity" section above. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp) in order to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures of third party ad servers we may use.

In the event that all or substantially all of our or the NFLRUSH website's assets are sold or transferred to another party, or another transaction occurs in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred, all personally identifiable information that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer.
