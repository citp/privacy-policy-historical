Some of the information we request from you is required in order for you to use our Service. If you do not wish to provide such information to us, you are not obligated to, but as a result you may not be able to use the particular Service or certain features. However, some of the personal information we request from you is optional. This means that you can elect not to provide it to us and you will still be able to use the Service.

The types of information that may be collected at these pages and elsewhere include but are not limited to:

  * Contact data including your first and last name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.
  * Credentials such as passwords, password hints, and similar security information for authentication and account access.
  * Demographic information such as your age, birthdate, gender, and country.
  * Payment data such as your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number) and the security code associated with your payment instrument, billing information including your name and address, and FanSided account details. We collect this data in order to process your payments for purchases, fulfill your requests for refunds, returns, or exchanges, and process the redemption of discounts.
  * If applicable, your username, interests, favorites, and other profile data including your enrollment in a FanSided Swag account.
  * The content of messages you send to us, such as feedback, suggestions, comments, or questions and any information you provide to customer support. We also collect the content of your communications as necessary to provide you with the services you use. For example, if you chat with another user through the Service, we need to collect the content of that chat to display it to you and the other user as you direct.
  * Data that you may send us in order to consider you for a job opening, or a content providing position including writer, site expert, or editor if you submit an application to us, such as contact, your employment history, transcript, writing samples, references, interests, and other information.



We may also collect information about your personal or professional interests and use of or opinions about various products, programs and services. You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the Service that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information.

 _ **Promotions or Surveys**_. When you enter a contest or sweepstakes (“Promotion”) or participate in a survey or poll (“Survey”) we ask you to provide your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. We use the information we collect on promotion entry forms to administer your participation in the promotions and for other purposes stated on the entry form. Our surveys ask for opinions on various issues and may be sponsored by our advertisers and partners. Information obtained through surveys is also aggregated and used internally.

 _ **Public Information**_. Certain areas of the Service, such as comments, are designed to help you share information with the world. Please remember that any information you disclose in public forums, community areas, and article comments becomes public information and is immediately accessible to other users, so it is important for you to carefully consider what, if any, personal information you reveal in these areas as you are solely responsible for any information you make public. We may use information disclosed by you in this way to promote our products and services in our advertising communications, among other things. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information; however, California residents have additional rights as set forth in the section entitled “ **Your Rights and Choices** ” below.

 **B.     Information Collected Automatically**

We automatically collect information about your device and how your device interacts with our Service. We may use Service Providers to collect this information. Some examples of information we collect include the following:

  *  **Service Use Data**. We collect data about the features you use, the pages you visit, the e-mails and advertisements you view, the products you purchase, the time of day you browse, the videos you view, your referring and exiting pages, and other similar information.
  *  **Device Connectivity and Configuration Data**. We collect data about the type of device or browser you use, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, and other similar information. This data also includes IP address, MAC address, device advertising ID (e.g., IDFA or AAID), and other device identifiers.
  *  **Mobile Device IDs and Location-Based Information**. Certain mobile devices, including smart phones and tablet devices, contain unique device IDs that can be used to identify their physical location. Some mobile device IDs are persistent, while others may be resettable by accessing the device’s privacy settings. Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data (which may include a phone number) when used to transmit a telephone call or text message. When you use mobile devices to access our Services, we may collect and transmit unique device IDs and collect caller ID data, as well as other information about your device, including without limitation, your wireless carrier, the make, model, operating system, capacity and settings of your device, the names, package IDs and versions of other software you have downloaded to your device and information about how you interact with and navigate within our Service. With your consent, we or our authorized service providers and partners also may use precise geolocation technology such as GPS or Wi-Fi triangulation or mobile Bluetooth beacon technology to collect information about the exact location of your mobile device. Precise location information may be collected both while you are using one of our mobile applications and continuously over time while our apps are not in use but are running in the background of your device. You can withdraw your consent to the further collection and use of your precise device location data through any of our mobile apps by accessing your device’s privacy settings as further explained below in “ **Your Rights and Choices: Location-Identifying Technologies.** ” For information about how to reset your advertising identifier and your other opt-out choices relating to interest-based advertising in mobile applications, see “ **Your Rights and Choices: Mobile App Advertising and Tracking**.”



We use various technologies to collect this information (“ **Tracking Technologies** ”), including the following:

  *  **Log Files**. A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, such as your service use data.
  *  **Cookies**. A cookie is a small data file stored on your device that acts as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use several types of cookies including session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Service. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings.
  *  **Pixels**. A pixel (also known as a web beacon) is code embedded in a website, video, e-mail, or advertisements that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, e-mail, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.
  *  **Device Fingerprinting**. Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and apps.
  *  **App Technologies, Customization, and Usage**. There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in our apps that allow us to collect information about your installation, use, and updating of our Apps as well as information about your device, including your unique device identifier (“ **UDID** ”) and other technical identifiers. More specifically, these tracking technologies allow us to collect data about your device and your use of our Apps, the pages, videos, other content, or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, and items you download. These tracking technologies are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us to track our conversions and communicate with you across devices, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, customize the app to your interests and preferences and link such across platforms and devices, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.
  *  **Location-Identifying Technologies**. GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect precise location data when you enable location-based services through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.
  *  **Voice Processing Technologies**. Voice processing technologies collect audio through the microphone on your device(s) to effectuate an instruction or request by you using Amazon Alexa Skills or Google Assistant. Please be aware that your use of Amazon Alexa Skills or Google Assistant may provide Amazon and Google with access to and use of information associated with your use of their device, including the audio you provide, and you should carefully review their privacy policy and terms of use. If you activate or use this functionality we will process the following data:
    * The serial number of your devices;
    * Functional characteristics and the status of your devices;
    * Data about how you interact with Alexa Skills or Google Assistant, including how often and where you use voice processing technology;
    * The content of your conversation in the form of transcripts; and
    * Personally identifiable features for telecommunications.

We process the data for the following purposes:

    * To ensure interaction and functionality of FanSided features with Alexa Skills and Google Assistant;
    * To offer you the appropriate service as requested through voice processing technology;
    * To improve our product and service offerings (for example, programs, features, and other functions used);
    * To contact you for the purposes of targeted offers of services and products tailored to your interests; and
    * To provide and enhance the user experience of our Alexa Skills and Google Assistant capabilities.

We may use non-audio data associated with your use of voice processing technologies for additional purposes such as data analytics and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.




Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third Party Services.

For further information on Tracking Technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the sections entitled “Third Parties” and “Your Rights and Choices” below.

 **C.   Information Collected from Other Sources**

We combine personal information collected through the Service with other information that we obtain about you, your computer, and/or device from other companies and sources. To the extent we combine personal information collected through the Service with information we obtain from third party sources, we will treat the combined data in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data.

FanSided also allows you to connect with other sites and services in order to share content and information. You should consult the other sites’ and services’ privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties or their use of your information.

For more information on tracking technologies and your rights and choices, see the section entitled “Your Rights and Choices” below.

 **B.     Third Party Features**

We may allow you to connect our Service to a Third Party Service or offer our Service through a Third Party Service (“ **Third Party Features** ”). If you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature, and you should carefully review the third party’s privacy policy and terms of use. Some examples of Third Party Features include the following:

 **Liking, Sharing, and Logging-In**. We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Service that allows you to “like” or “share” content on, or log-in to your FanSided account through, Third Party Services, including Disqus and social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. If you choose to engage with such a Third Party Service through our Service, we may collect any information you have authorized the Third Party Service to share with us (such as your user ID, billing information, public profile information, e-mail address, birthday, friends list, and other account and profile data).

For example, we use Tracking Technologies from third party analytics provides, such as Google Analytics, to help us analyze your use of the Service, compile statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and provide us with other services relating to Service activity and internet usage. We also work with ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third Party Services. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Service and Third Party Services (including in e-mails and advertisements) to track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and Third Party Services or third party devices after you have left the Service (“Interest-based Advertising”).

We may serve ads on Third Party Services, such as Facebook and Google, which are targeted to reach people (or similar people) on those services that have visited our Service or that are also identified in one of more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by matching common factors between our data and the data of Third Party Services. If we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve Matched Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad and find out how to opt-out. We are not responsible for such Third Party Services’ failure to comply with your opt-out instructions.

 **E.   Your California Privacy Rights.**

California’s “Shine the Light” law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business should either provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing.

FanSided may share personal information as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law with third parties and/or affiliates for such third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to obtain information about our compliance with this law, please contact us as set forth in the section entitled “Contact Us” below. Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that FanSided is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided e-mail address or mail address.

Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service and posted content or information on the Service, can request that such information be removed from the Service by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address set forth in the section entitled “Contact Us” below. Requests must state that the user personally posted such content or information and detail where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view.

 **6.  Security**

We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, loss, modification, disclosure, and any form of unlawful processing of personal information in our custody and control, and our service providers are bound to maintain similar safeguards. These measures also aim at preventing unnecessary collection and further processing of personal information.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

 **7.  Children**

The Service is intended for a general audience and not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age. FanSided does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act (“ **COPPA** ”) in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and believe FanSided has collected such information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please email us at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and we will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.
