This page explains how SJB Research Ltd (“SJB Research”, “we”), the publisher of NFC World (“NFCW”) uses personal data that we collect and process and the ways in which we protect your privacy.

## Site users

We avoid collecting any personally identifiable data from visitors to our website wherever it is possible to do so within the confines of providing you with a commercially viable online information service.

We use log files and analytics services to gain insight into the overall usage of our site. These enable us to make changes to the layout of the site and to the information in it, based on the way that visitors move around it.
