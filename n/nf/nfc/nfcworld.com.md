This page explains how SJB Research uses the information you give to us, and the ways in which we protect your privacy.

### The Data Protection Act

Under the UK's Data Protection Act we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We will only use your information for the purpose we have described and we do not pass on your details to any third party unless you give us permission to do so. We use appropriate security technologies to safeguard your data and take appropriate steps to prevent unauthorised access to it.

However, if you do this, you may not be able to use some site features because we need to record your preferences in order to give you the information you need during your visit.

Our cookies do not contain any personal information about you.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

#### Log files and analytics

Log files allow us to record visitors' use of the site. They enable us to make changes to the layout of the site and to the information in it, based on the way that visitors move around it.

We also use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) and [Woopra](http://www.woopra.com/) to gather anonymised aggregate data for this purpose and we do not gather or make use of any personal information from which individuals can be identified.

### Mailing lists

#### What data do we collect?

When you subscribe to our mailing lists we necessarily record your email address. We also collect your subscription preferences, which at this time is limited to details of which lists you are subscribed to.

We may also gather other personal information such as your organisation and job title along with general demographic information including your industry sector and country. This information is aggregated to provide general statistics on our audience to inform product planning and marketing activities.

We use a specialist third-party service provider to administer our mailing lists. Information you provide in relation to mailing list subscriptions will be held securely on their servers, which may be physically located outside the European Union.

#### For what purpose do we intend to use your personal information?

We will use your personal information to send you updates from the mailing lists that you have joined. The information you provide may be used by SJB Research to communicate with you. We may add your personal information to other internal databases if you go on to interact with us in other ways, for example by downloading a white paper, applying for a trial subscription or becoming a customer. Your email address will not be shared with third parties (other than our contracted mailing list service provider solely for the purpose of administering the list).

### White papers and other downloads

#### What data do we collect?

In partnership with our advertisers we may offer valuable information products in the form of downloadable white papers, webinars, and other materials. These products are offered on the understanding that we may collect personal information from you as part of a registration process before you download, view, participate or otherwise take advantage of them. The personal information we collect typically includes your email address, organisation and job title along with general demographic information including your industry sector and country.

#### For what purpose do we intend to use your personal information?

The information you provide may be shared with the advertising partner which sponsors the information product you have chosen to download. The information you provide may be used by SJB Research or the advertising partner to communicate with you. If, in the future, you choose to download further information products, the information you provide may also be shared with the advertising partners which sponsor those products.

### Links to external sites

Like most sites, those operated by SJB Research contain links to external sites. It should be noted that this privacy policy can apply only to sites under the control of SJB Research and that we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.

We do not pass on any personal information you have given us to any other website.

### Changes to this privacy policy
