# Privacy Policy

##### Introduction

At the National Fire Protection Association, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you, including information that you may provide when you visit the website http://www.nfpa.org (our “Website”), other NFPA web-based properties and any NFPA applications (all of these collectively, the " **NFPA Web Properties** ") and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. 

This policy applies to information we collect:

  * online, including but not limited to information collected on NFPA Web Properties, social media and networking channels
  * through telephone, email, text, live chat and other electronic messages between you and NFPA Web Properties that you visit;
  * through surveys, questionnaires or other forms
  * through mobile and desktop applications you download from NFPA, including those which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and NFPA;
  * when you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services



It does not apply to information collected by a third party.  When a third party collects or uses your information, their policies apply.

Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Web Properties, or, to the extent applicable, to opt out of a particular data collection, use or sharing practice. By accessing or using NFPA Web Properties, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to this Privacy Policy). Your continued use of NFPA Web Properties reflects your consent to the terms of this policy and any changes that may be made to it, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

Except for the NFPA website [www.sparky.org](https://www.sparky.org/), which is designed for children, including children under age 13; our Web Properties are not intended for children under 16 years of age who are not supervised by a parent or guardian. No one unsupervised under age 16 should provide any information to or on NFPA Web Properties. We do not knowingly collect information from or about unsupervised children under 16. If you are under 16, do not register on NFPA Web Properties, make any purchases through the Web Properties, use any of the interactive or public comment features of our Web Properties or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at:
