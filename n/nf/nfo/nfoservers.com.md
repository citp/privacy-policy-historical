# NuclearFallout Enterprises :: Game Server Rentals and Hosting :: Privacy policy

**Categories of information that we collect and who we share that information with.**

We collect only first name, last name, and email address from our subscribers in order to uniquely identify each person in our database. We do not share this information with any third party with the exception of our payment processor, Paypal. 

Paypal may also directly request further information from each subscriber for billing purposes, such as a physical address and credit card information (or other payment method information). Paypal is governed by its own privacy policy that each renter should read when signing up for the subscription at the Paypal website and before entering any private information into a Paypal webpage. Paypal occasionally shares the physical address of a renter with us, but we do not collect or store this information. Paypal does not share billing information such as credit card number or checking account withdrawal codes with us, and we will never ask for or accept such information. 

**Process to review and request changes to stored personally identifiable information.**

At any time, customers (and anyone who has created an account in our system) may change the email address we associate with their name and current subscriptions by logging into the Control panel (available through a link on the lower-left-hand side of http://rentals.nuclearfallout.net) and following the instructions on the Account page located on the lower-left-hand side. 

Individuals may not change their last or first name, or remove their account entirely, using this method. If an individual wishes to change his or her first or last name or have his or her account purged from our database, he or she will need to email us at the email address shown on the About page of the rentals website at http://rentals.nuclearfallout.net, from the registered email address of the account. 

**Process by which we notify consumers of changes to our privacy policy.**

Changes to this privacy policy will be posted here and emailed directly to each individual's registered email address in our system. 

**Effective date.**

The effective date of the current privacy policy is June 28, 2004.
