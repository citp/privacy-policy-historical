IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. The IP address is considered personal information because it is an identifying number, and IP addresses are protected by most privacy legislation. The privacy issues surrounding IP addresses are explained further below. <br><br><strong>Server logs</strong><br>Server logs include statistical information, such as visitors' IP addresses, type of operating systems, time and duration of visit, Web pages requested, and identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types. Our servers automatically log information about visits to our Web site in the normal course of establishing and maintaining Web connections. These statistics are reported in the aggregate to our Web and communications staff, and are used to improve our Web site and ensure that it provides the optimal Web experience for visitors. <br><br>We do not link server log information to any other data in a way that would enable us to identify individual visitors. However, we may review server logs for security purposes, for example, to detect intrusions into our network. In the event of a criminal investigation, server log data could be used to trace and identify individuals for prosecution. <br><br><strong>Cookies</strong><br>Cookies are small text files maintained by your computer in order to help your browser remember user settings as you navigate the site. For example, NDP.ca uses cookies to remind your browser whether you chose to view the site in English or in French. <br><br>Other sites to which we provide links may be governed by different policies. The New Democratic Party of Canada does not assume responsibility for the information practices of these other Web sites, and we strongly encourage all Web visitors to review the privacy policies and statements of all externally-linked sites. <br><br><strong>Still have questions?</strong><br>Questions about this policy may be directed to our Webmaster. Contact our Webmaster by e-mail <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/contact/">here</a>, by phone at 613-236-3613 or by postal mail at: <br></p><p>New Democratic Party of Canada<br>Suite 300 - 279 Laurier Avenue West<br>Ottawa, Ontario<br>K1P 5J9</p><p></p>
