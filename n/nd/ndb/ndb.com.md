What This Privacy Policy Covers

This policy covers how NDB.com ("Website", "we", "us", "our") treats Personal Information about you. Personal Information is information about you that we collect and receive related to your use of the Website and/or our products or services, and that is personally identifiable like your name, address, credit or debit card number, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control or to people that we do not employ or manage. Other than the reference to our people search database Opt-Out Policy at the end of this Privacy Policy, this policy does not apply to any information in our people search databases. 

Your Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States and other countries, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not rent, sell, or share Personal Information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with us. These companies may use your Personal Information to help communicate with you about offers from us and our marketing partners. Examples of these are third party payment processors who expedite payments on our Website and marketing partners, such as our identity theft protection partner.
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms and Conditions, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if we or our assets are acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify you by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our Website before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  * We may display targeted advertisements based on Personal Information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
  * We do not provide any Personal Information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement. However, by interacting with or viewing an advertisement you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advertisement.
  * We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our corporate affiliates, in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
