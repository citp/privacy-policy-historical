The North Dakota State University (NDSU) Information Technology Division is committed to honoring and respecting the privacy of all those who visit the NDSU website to the extent permitted by law and NDSU policy. This online privacy statement is intended to inform you of what information is collected by this website and how the information is used. 

For security purposes and to ensure that the website remains available to all users, NDSU monitors network traffic to identify attempts to compromise or damage university networks or systems connected to those networks.

NDSU collects and analyzes aggregate data about visitor traffic to determine trends and improve the website. The data collected may include, but is not limited to:

  * Domain and country
  * Internet protocol (IP) address
  * Internet browser
  * Operating system
  * Entrance and exit pages, and referrals
  * Date and time
  * Search terms and search engines

This is a standard practice for websites, and it is not used for any purpose other than to evaluate how NDSU can design the website to best serve customer needs.

NDSU has implemented physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, ultimately to assist in maintaining data security and ensure appropriate use of the information we collect online.

NDSU does not collect personal information such as name or address unless you voluntarily provide it by sending email, participating in a survey or completing an online form.
