This online privacy statement is intended to inform you of what information is collected by this website and how the information is used.

Please note that NDSU websites not administered by the Information Technology Division may adopt different privacy practices as their specific needs require.

For security purposes and to ensure that the website remains available to all users, the NDSU Information Technology Division monitors network traffic to identify attempts to compromise or damage university networks or systems connected to those networks.

This is a standard practice for websites, and it is used to evaluate how NDSU can design the website to best serve customer needs. In some cases, a third party may have been authorized to collect some of this same information and provide reporting for marketing purposes.

The NDSU Information Technology Division has implemented physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, ultimately to assist in maintaining data security and ensure appropriate use of the information we collect online.

These services help NDSU better understand and improve the university website's performance and user experience.
