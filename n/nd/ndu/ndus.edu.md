# North Dakota University System : Privacy Policy

Records received by the North Dakota University System from websites are subject to the same controls and uses as records collected by governmental offices visited in person. The NDUS Office provides security for information provided to it, and the office does not sell information it receives.

Information collected on this site is retained in accordance with record retention schedules developed by this office, which may be required to disclose collected information pursuant to a court order. In addition, we may be authorized to share this information with other state agencies for purposes of child support enforcement, law enforcement, collection of debts owed to the state or its political subdivisions and any other purpose authorized by law.

Information not specifically addressed in this policy must be disclosed pursuant to North Dakota open records laws.

E-mail addresses are collected only if a response is necessary or if there is a need to correspond with website users. If website users send e-mails while using this site, e-mail addresses will be collected so a representative of the University System may reply. We may forward messages to other agencies for appropriate action. 

**Policies on Other Websites**  
This website links to other websites maintained by individual state agencies, political subdivisions, nonprofit organizations and private businesses. Each of these entities is responsible for setting and publishing its own privacy policies. Users of the NDUS website who link to other sites are subject to the privacy policies of those sites.
