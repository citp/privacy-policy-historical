# Northwest Federal Credit Union (NWFCU) - Privacy Statement

Northwest Federal Credit Union (NWFCU) is committed to providing financial products and services that enable its members to meet their financial needs and attain their financial goals. Protecting personal information and using it in a manner consistent with member expectations is a high priority for everyone associated with NWFCU. Your trust is important to us and it is essential as we work together to meet your financial goals.

**Your Personal Information**  
In the course of providing you with products and services, Northwest Federal Credit Union acquires information from you in person, during telephone interviews, on applications or other forms you complete, and from outside sources, including consumer reporting agencies. We also maintain information about your transactions with us.

**Sharing Within the Northwest Federal Family**   
Northwest Federal Credit Union works together with its subsidiary, Northwest Financial LLC, to offer members a wide-range of financial products and services. Your member eligibility information will not be shared between NWFCU and Northwest Financial LLC for marketing purposes. However, NWFCU and Northwest Financial LLC may market one another’s products to you on the other’s behalf.

**Maintaining Confidentiality of Personal Information**  
We do not share any personal information about you or our former members with third parties except as permitted or required by law, and as necessary for business purposes. For example, we may share information to comply with U.S. tax laws and court orders, or with consumer reporting agencies. We may also share information with companies that work for us in providing you products and services, for example, check printers. These companies act on our behalf and are obligated to keep any information we share with them confidential. Northwest Federal Credit Union may enter into agreements with other financial service providers to offer members high-quality financial products and services at reduced prices or to provide marketing services on our behalf. We may also enter into an agreement with a company that provides mail services to notify you of NWFCU's products and services or other special promotions. As part of these agreements, we may share account-related information such as your name, address, or account activity. These agreements require that your information be kept confidential and used only for the purpose of offering you products, services, or promotions approved by NWFCU.

**Keeping Your Information Secure**  
Northwest Federal Credit Union is committed to keeping your information secure. We access your personal information only when necessary to service or maintain your accounts, and to meet your needs. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your personal information. Please be aware that third parties can obtain your personal information from outside sources. This information could be used for solicitation purposes. For example, when you obtain a mortgage or equity loan, by law the transaction is recorded in the public land records of the jurisdiction where the property is located. This information, including the lender's name, becomes public and is available to anyone who visits the Record Clerk’s office.
