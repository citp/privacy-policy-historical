**Does** **NWSL** **Collect Any Information About Users Under Age 13?**

NWSL does not knowingly solicit or collect information from anyone under the age of 13, unless explicitly stated on a Site, and unless stated therein, all the Sites are directed at persons 13 years of age or older. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13, or the legal age of contract majority, and have authorized your child to use your computer, NWSL urges you to instruct your child never to give out his or her real name, address, phone number, email address or other personally identifying information while on the Sites.  There are no computer applications on the Sites which allow for the determination of your age. If NWSL discovers that personal information of a child under 13 has been collected without parental or guardian consent, NWSL will take reasonable steps to delete this information. All information volunteered to NWSL will be treated the same as information given by an adult.  NWSL recommends that the Internet browsing behavior of any child should be carefully supervised by a responsible adult at all times.

**Does** **NSWL** **Collect Any Information About Users Age 13 and Older?**

  1. The Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) and/or your computer, if it has its own static IP address.  The domain name may also be collected. Your IP location information may be used during your visit to the Sites to serve you location specific information or advertisements for goods or services available in your specific location, however, such information will not be collected or maintained by NWSL except in aggregate or generic form.
  2. The date, time, length of stay and specific NWSL web pages, images, videos, documents or forms accessed by you at such Sites, including videos or content you watch or interact with.
  3. Whether you are viewing any of the Sites for the first time, or are a return visitor.
  4. The Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website or advertisement that referred you to any of the Sites.
  5. The search engine that referred you and any search strings or phrases entered into the search engine to find any of the Sites.
  6. Demographic information concerning your country of origin and language(s) used.

NWSL collects this General Information and may use it to generate generic or aggregate statistics about visitors to and users of the Sites.  In situations where it is possible to do so, General Information may be linked to Personal Information.

**Personal Information Collected**

“Personal Information” is information through which you can be identified.  Providing your Personal Information to NWSL is your choice.  NWSL maintains one or more databases to store your Personal Information and may keep such information indefinitely.

To participate in the various services provided on the Sites, NWSL ask for Personal Information, which may include your full name and email address. NWSL also may collect other information, your first name (no last name), city and/or state, and country, which NWSL considers Personal Information only if combined with any of the items of Personal Information listed in the first sentence of this Section.  NWSL explains below how NWSL will use this information.

**Social Media**

The Sites may include social media features, including links to share, post or link NWSL’s content through your accounts with third party social media services. If you choose to interact with social media features on or from the Sites, or if you are logged in to your social media accounts while using the Sites, social media services may collect information about your use of the Sites. Information collected by third party social media services is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties, not NWSL.

NWSL may collect your social media username or ID, social media plug-in information, and URL clickstream to, through and from the Sites (including date and time). Information collected by social media sites may include names, titles or descriptions of videos or content viewed through your use of the Sites. Your use of the Sites and any third party social media services constitutes your agreement and consent to the collection and use of information about the videos and content you view through the Sites.

**Third Party Advertising**

NWSL may collect information about your activity on the Sites with third parties for ad distribution and ad optimization (defined as the tailoring, targeting [i.e., behavioral, contextual], retargeting, analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing of ads).  These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect information for such purposes.  Pixel tags enable NWSL and these third-party advertising companies to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site.  In addition, NWSL may receive information from advertisers and/or their service providers such as advertising identifiers, IP addresses, and post-conversion data. These third parties may collect any of the types of information described in this Privacy Policy. NWSL’s third-party partners may combine information collected about you through your use of the Sites with information they collect through other websites, apps or services you use. For more information on these third parties, including how to opt out from certain data collection, please visit [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) and [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

NWSL and the third-party technology providers, ad exchanges, ad networks, advertisers, agencies, ad exchanges, and ad servers with which NWSL work use third-party analytics services (e.g., Adobe Omniture) to evaluate your use of the Sites, compile reports on activity, collect demographic data, analyze performance metrics, and collect and evaluate other information relating to the Sites and mobile and Internet usage. These third parties use cookies and other technologies to help analyze and provide NWSL the data. You consent to the processing of data about you by these analytics providers in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. These third parties may collect any of the types of information described in this Privacy Policy. NWSL’s third-party partners may combine information collected about you through your use of NWSL’s Sites with information they collect through other websites, apps or services you use.

**Video Content**

NWSL may collect, use and share information about videos you view on the Sites with NWSL’s third-party partners as described in this Privacy Policy. NWSL may also collect information from third parties regarding videos you view on third party sites. You agree and consent to this sharing and collection for two years or until you affirmatively withdraw consent. You may also be able to control information shared with NWSL through third parties, such as social media services, through your privacy settings on those services.

By associating your social media or other third party website account with your use of the Sites and authorizing NWSL to have access to this information, you consent to this collection, use, and disclosure of video and content viewing information to these social media services and websites in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**How Does NWSL Share Information with Third-Party Internet-Based Advertising Companies?**

NWSL may share information about you, including your Personal Information, with third-party Internet-based advertising companies. This information is used to help such advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target.

**What About Information Shared on Community Services** **?**

NWSL may make message boards, blogs, and other community services available to you on the Sites.

**Does NWSL Use De-Identified Information?**

We make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct such data at your request if it is inaccurate or delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.  If you wish to request the correction or deletion of such data, you may contact NWSL by email at [privacy@nwslsoccer.com](mailto:privacy@nwslsoccer.com) or by mail at:

NWSL Media, LLC

1556 S. Michigan Ave., Floor 2

Chicago, Illinois 60605

Attn: General Manager  
Please note in order to protect the security of your information, you will be required to properly identify yourself before NWSL can process such a request.

The security and confidentiality of your personal information is important to NWSL and NWSL will take reasonable measures to protect it, including measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, and disclosure.  These security measures include, for example, internal reviews of NWSL’s data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where NWSL store personal data.

When the use of a NWSL web page or app involves the transmission of Personal Information, NWSL may use Secure Socket Layer (“ _SSL_ ”) technology to establish a secure connection between your computer or device and NWSL and/or the Sites.  NWSL may also allow the transmission of encrypted information from your computer or device to NWSL and back again.

NWSL reserves the right to monitor all network traffic to the Sites to identify and/or block unauthorized attempts or intrusions to upload or change information or cause damage to any of the Sites in any manner.  Anyone using any of the Sites expressly consents to such monitoring.

__Please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet or which is stored on a computer connected to the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so while NWSL strives to protect your personal information, NWSL cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you voluntarily give to us__.

**Does NWSL Use Cookies?**

When you visit or use the Sites, NWSL may place a cookie in a file directory on your computer or mobile device. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device to uniquely distinguish your visit to a website or use of an online service or mobile application. The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit and your registration information. Cookies may offer you many conveniences for NWSL’s Sites and allow NWSL to recognize certain information, such as your browser type, so NWSL knows if you can view certain plug-ins or extensions.  They also allow NWSL to streamline your visit to the Sites based on your previous visits.

Cookies may be either permanent or temporary.  NWSL may use both temporary and permanent cookies.  A temporary or “session” cookie is placed on your computer or mobile device during your visit to any of NWSL’s Sites and is deleted when you exit your Internet browser, the mobile application, and/or turn off your computer or device. A permanent or “persistent” cookie means that the cookie stays on your hard drive or mobile device until you delete it. You can delete NWSL’s permanent cookie at any time by following the instructions contained in your browser’s help file, or by contacting the company providing your browser’s or mobile device’s technical support.  NWSL does not use cookies to store information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers or any other highly sensitive Personal Information.

You may also be able to reset or restrict the advertising cookies contained on your device or in your internet browser by accessing the privacy settings for such device and/or browser. Please follow the instructions contained in your browser’s help file, or by contacting the company providing your browser’s or mobile device’s technical support to do so, such as Apple for iOS devices.

You may configure your browser or device to accept or deny cookies from the Sites.  However, disabling or denying cookies from the Sites may render parts of them inaccessible or may cause certain web pages or parts of the app not to properly load. There are also several services and websites which allow you to visit websites, including the Sites, anonymously. Again, you may not be able to access or use all of the content or services available on the Sites if you use these anonymizing services or websites.  If you change computers or browsers or devices, or use multiple computers or browsers or devices or delete NWSL’s cookies, you will need to repeat this process for each computer, each browser, and each device.

**Does NWSL Use Web Beacons/Pixel Tags?**

NWSL may use “Web Beacons,” sometimes referred to as “pixels,” “clear gifs,” or “web bugs,” which is another way (instead of cookies) to help personalize your experience on the Sites.  Web Beacons are typically invisible to you and are generally embedded in very small clear graphics files. “Pixel Tags” are small strings of computer code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or other medium. Pixel Tags allow NWSL or a third party who serves the Pixel Tag, to set, read, and modify some of NWSL’s cookies.

NWSL may use Web Beacons and Pixel Tags to monitor certain non-personally identifiable information about you, including the URL of the page from which the Web Beacon or Pixel Tag originated, the type of browser used, the IP address of your computer and the time you viewed the Web Beacon or Pixel Tag. NWSL may also use Web Beacons and Pixel Tags to assist NWSL’s third-party advertising and/or content companies in providing the content they believe you want to see. Web Beacons and Pixel Tags are also used to allow such third parties to determine how many people view the advertisements and/or click through, and to assist in serving and managing advertisements and content.  While Web Beacons and Pixel Tags do not collect Personal Information, the information collected by them may be used in conjunction with Cookies to identify aggregate information about users of the Sites.

**What Happens with Do Not Track Requests?**

NWSL does not currently have the capabilities to recognize the Do Not Track signals from Internet browsers.  Therefore, any selection you make within your Internet browser will not be applied to the Sites.  For more information regarding Do Not Track you can visit [www.allaboutdnt.org](http://www.allaboutdnt.org/).

**Links or Usage of Third Party Websites/App Stores**

The Sites may contain links to third-party websites. NWSL has no control over the privacy practices or the content of such third-party websites. Neither NWSL, nor any of its officers, directors, partners, employees, agents, representatives, vendors or suppliers are responsible for the content, privacy policies, products, services, reliability, viewpoint or accuracy of information on any such websites.  NWSL does not control and is not responsible for the collection of personal information by third party websites, including websites owned or controlled by NWSL’s preferred financial partners, advertisers, vendors and/or websites not controlled by NWSL.

The app stores (e.g., App Store or Google Play) may collect certain information in connection with your use of the Sites, including Personal Information, geo-locational information, payment information, and other usage-based data. NWSL has no control over the collection of such information by any third-party app store, and any such collection or use will be subject to such third-party app store’s applicable privacy policy.

**For California Residents Only – Please Read**
