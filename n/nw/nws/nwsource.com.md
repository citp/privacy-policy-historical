# The Seattle Times Company: Privacy statement

Last updated November 2001

**The Seattle Times Company privacy statement**  


The following statement discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the Web sites of The Seattle Times Company. This statement applies to The Seattle Times Company's family of Web sites and explains data collection and usage at these sites: seattletimes.com, NWsource.com and NWclassifieds.com. 

**Our philosophy**

We will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about our customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission. 

**Collection of personal information**

At some sites, The Seattle Times Company may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address and phone number. At other sites, The Seattle Times Company may collect anonymous information such as zip codes and favorites. Information collected at one Seattle Times Company Web site may be shared within The Seattle Times Company family of Web sites. 

The Seattle Times Company has many relationships with third-party content, service and technology providers. When you use these third-party services offered on our sites, personal information you provide may be collected directly by these third parties in order to deliver the services you have requested. 

Some information about you is automatically collected via server logs. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring URLs. We use this information to administer our Web site, help diagnose problems with our server, and to help identify you as a unique visitor to our site and to gather broad information about your site usage. 

Information that you disclose about yourself in a public chat room, message board or other public forum will immediately become available to anyone who has access to those public areas. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

Our sites contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites and encourage you to read the privacy statements of sites you visit. 

**Use of your personal information**

The Seattle Times Company Web sites collect and use your personal information to operate our Web sites and to deliver the services you have requested. We do not share personal information we may collect, such as names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers, with third parties, unless we disclose that we are doing so at the time you submit your information. The only information we regularly share with third parties, including our advertisers, is aggregate information about site usage and demographics. 

The Seattle Times Company has many relationships with third-party content, service and technology providers.
