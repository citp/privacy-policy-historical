Delta is always conscious and respectful of your privacy. We recognize the importance of protecting your personal information. 

## Privacy Policy 

**Last updated:** May 7, 2007

This Privacy Policy will answer your questions about the kinds of information we or our agents collect and how it is used. We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. For this reason, please check regularly for the most recent version of our privacy policy.

If you have any further questions or comments, contact us using the [Email Us](https://web.archive.org/emailus/servlet/EmailUs?cmd=go) page.

### What information does Delta gather and how is it used?

We collect information about your visits to our sites, such as your Internet service provider, browser type, operating system, pages accessed on our sites and the date and time of access to optimize your user experience and enhance your time spent with us online. We also receive information telling us what site you linked to our site from.

When you send us an email using the [Email Us](https://web.archive.org/emailus/servlet/EmailUs?cmd=go) page, we will retain the content of the email, your email address, and our response in order to handle any follow-up questions you may have. We also use this information to measure how effectively we address your concerns.

We retain your name, and may retain other personal information such as mailing address, email address or credit card number when appropriate. We may ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences. We may combine this information with information about you which we gather from other sources. We may use the information to design offers customized to your interests.

If you have provided us with an email address, we may send you email messages related to your transactions with us. We and our [SkyMiles Partners](https://web.archive.org/skymiles/ways_to_get_miles/) and [Promotional Partners](https://web.archive.org/privacy_security/promotional_partners/) may also send informational or promotional email messages to you, which you may opt out of receiving as described below.

### With whom does Delta share my personally identifiable information?

We do not sell your name or other personally identifiable information to third parties, and do not intend to do so in the future. We routinely share your information with our [SkyMiles Partners](https://web.archive.org/skymiles/ways_to_get_miles/) and [Promotional Partners](https://web.archive.org/privacy_security/promotional_partners/) and our subsidiaries including Delta Connection® Carriers. From time to time, we may engage third parties to process your information on our behalf; however, Delta requires that these third parties comply with Delta’s privacy policy when processing this information. When you purchase services or products through Delta that are to be provided by another party (for example, a travel segment on another carrier, hotel accommodations, or rental car), we share your information with the third-party so that the third-party can provide the services or products you requested. We may also receive information about you from the third-party providers.

We may share with third parties anonymous, aggregated information about all our users.

Security regulations of several countries may require us to provide foreign and domestic government agencies with access to data you disclose to us.

We may disclose personally identifiable information to government authorities or to third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process, to the extent we are required by law to do so.

Delta has engaged third party tracking and advertising providers such as DoubleClick to act on Delta's behalf to track and analyze your usage of our sites through the use of cookies, pixel tags / web beacons, and similar technologies.
