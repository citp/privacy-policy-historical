				<h3>What information is collected?</h3>
					<p>All users are required to register via the online form. We ask that you complete the registration form with accurate information so we can ensure proper prize and award distributions.  We ask you to provide the following information; and when you do so, you will be agreeing  to the contest terms and conditions. 
					Name<br> 
					Address<br>
					Email address<br>
					Birthdate</p>
		
				<a name="2"></a>
				<h3>How will you use my personal information collected online? </h3>
				<p>Without your consent, we will never use your personal information except for the purposes for which it is submitted, such as to register you for participation in a tournament, opt-you in to sponsor offers, reply to your emails, handle your complaints, and process billing and awards payment and business requests related to tournament participation.  We may also use such information to provide notifications related to tournament participation.  </p>
				<p>Unless you opt out, NLOP from time to time may send you new offers and product promotions to bring selected retail opportunities to our players, and we may include your personal information in a database of names of potential tournament participants provided to organizations running a tournament through NLOP. By responding to such offers and promotions you may be accessing another website.  In that case, this Privacy Policy will no longer apply.  Instead, you will have to contact those advertisers separately and inform them if you do not wish to receive future mailings from them.  And remember, you may opt out of providing your personal information to third party businesses and non-profit organizations by checking the "opt out" box that appears in your game play reminders form us.</p>

				<h3>Will NLOP or its partners share my personal information with any third parties? </h3>
				<p><strong>Internal Service Providers.</strong><br>
					We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you on this site (such as search technology and prize distribution) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit any use of the information we provide them for any purpose other than to facilitate the specific outsourced site-related operation.  </p>
				<p><strong>Legal Requests.</strong><br>
					We cooperate with law enforcement agencies and will respond to all requests related to a law-enforcement activity by providing the requested information without a subpoena. </p>
				<p><strong>Our Corporate Family.</strong><br>
					From time to time we may share your data with our parent, affiliates, subsidiary corporations and entities and joint ventures as well as any other business entity connected with a planned merger with or acquisition by that business entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follows this privacy policy with respect to your personal information.(called "Corporate Family") that are committed to serving your online  needs and providing related services. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will agree to treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our Corporate Family follows privacy practices substantially similar to NLOP's Privacy Policy. Should any such a combination, merger or acquisition occur, we will require that the new combined entity agrees to follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information.</p>
