### What Information We Collect and How It Is Used

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's Internet Protocol Address (IP Address). When a visitor requests a page or file from the NLU web site, our servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in web site analytics software applications. We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our servers do not automatically record the e-mail addresses of our web site visitors.

When a visitor accesses and completes our online Admissions Application form and online Request More Information form, this data is collected and transmitted securely across the internet and housed in our administrative database for processing. We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information or for processing online applications submitted via our web site.

National Louis University has multiple means of communication with students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends. Certain communications are internal and cannot be opted out of, especially those concerning campus health and safety. All other communications from NLU will provide opt-out controls within each communication and users will have the ability to unsubscribe from emails directly within the message. Opt-out preferences will be processed immediately and will be effective no later than 10 days after submission.
