Processing for the purpose of improving payment methods and payment processes may include processing where your personal data, inter alia your personal identity number, is transferred to other companies within NLY’s group and to third party providers to be included in the basis for the analysis. The personal data may therefore be processed together with data in other registers, e.g. registers for credit reports.

#### How will we protect your personal data? 

In order to protect the personal data that we process, we have implemented several security measures. We have implemented security procedures and technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data e.g. certification procedures for web browsers. We furthermore have sufficient firewalls and anti-virus programs in order to protect and prevent unauthorized access to the network. Physical access to the premises where the data is stored is limited and employees are required to be identified in order to gain access. 

NLY furthermore uses e.g. SLL (Secure Socket Layer) which is a protocol for the safe transfer of data over the Internet (or other networks). As a customer, you need to check that SLL is not turned off in the settings of the web browser. With the purpose of preventing any unauthorized access upon processing you credit card number, one-way codes will be used.
