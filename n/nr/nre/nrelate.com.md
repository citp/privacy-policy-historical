**Privacy Policy**

Welcome to nRelate.com, a Website owned and controlled by nRelate, LLC., a subsidiary of IAC, Inc. (“nRelate”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).  We operate a platform through which websites and other platforms can display other content owners’ work – including articles, product reviews, videos and blog posts.   This helps website owners to provide relevant third party content to their users.  When you see web content (usually thumbnails at the bottom or side of a page) that says “About These Links” and click on that link, you may see a pop-up box that identifies the content as being placed with our help.  Our mission is to help websites, applications and other services use their free space show content that is both relevant and interesting, while also subsidizing their own (usually free) content.

We provide this privacy policy to let you know what information we collect from you, and how we use, share and protect it.  We refer to the content that we help display as “Content Links.”

**Scope**

This Privacy Policy applies to the website located at [www.nRelate.com](http://nrelate.com/) (the “nRelate Website”), the tools and interactive forums made available through the nRelate Website and the nRelate content-sharing platform (collectively the “Services”).

Generally, there are three categories of users of the nRelate Website and Services: “Publishers” who are operators or publishers of websites that make the nRelate sharing platform available on their own website, “Marketers,” who display their content across our platform, and “Users” who are individuals that visit a website.  By visiting the nRelate Website or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy governs two sets of data practices:

[Privacy Practices for Users of the nRelate Services and Content Links](http://nrelate.com/privacy-policy/#section2)

[Privacy Practices for Users of This Website](http://nrelate.com/privacy-policy/#section5)

**2. nRelate Services Content Choices and Opt-Out**

We believe that delivering targeted and relevant content enhances your internet experience.As we describe further in this Privacy Policy, we (or a partner we work with) may collect non-personally identifiable information from the websites that use the nRelate Services, including information about your browser, device, or IP address, and we (or our partner) may collect and use that information to avoid showing you the same content multiple times on Publishers’ websites, or to deliver content we think is relevant to you based on the content you have clicked on in the past on Publishers’ or other websites.If you prefer that we do not collect this information about your website visits for the purpose of delivering targeted advertising, you may [opt-out.](http://nrelate.com/opt-out.php)

If you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer.  The opt-out cookie tells us not to use your information for customizing content we serve.  This may mean, for instance, that you may receive the same content multiple times rather than receiving new or targeted content.  Please note that if you block cookies, our opt-out process may not function properly. Please also note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, clear your cookie cache, update your browser, or if you go online with a different computer or internet browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
