National Rugby League
Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers National Rugby League Limited and each of its associates, related entities and
subsidiaries (together, the NRL). For the avoidance of doubt, a reference in this Policy to the NRL
(including the NRL doing or not doing an act) is a reference to, and is intended to also cover, the Leagues.
The NRL recognises that privacy is important and that an individual has the right to control his or her
Personal Information. The NRL is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals and their Personal
Information which the NRL collects during the course of administering and developing the game of Rugby
League.
This Privacy Policy is based on the National Privacy Principles in Schedule 3 to the Privacy Act and sets
out the way the NRL handles the Personal Information it collects, uses, discloses and stores on:
(a)      Rugby League participants, including Players and Officials (together, Participants);
(b)      persons who register for any NRL sanctioned accreditation or licensing program;
(c)      persons who purchase or receive information about tickets to Matches, including the NRL, State
         of Origin, National Youth Competitions and Representative Matches;
(d)      persons who subscribe and/or register to any Rugby League membership program, participation
         program, newsletter or promotional offer; or
(e)      persons who request services from the NRL or more information about the NRL, Competitions or
         Matches
         (you, your).

              NRL’s functions or activities in administering the game of Rugby League including for the
              following primary purposes:
              (a)      organisation, conduct and promotion of Competitions and Matches (including for
                       the purpose of providing information and making ticket offers to you);
              (b)      direct communication with you by Rugby League Administrators;
              (c)      disclosure to Rugby League Partners, unless you have indicated that you do not

              (d)      compliance with the NRL Rules, including the administration and development of

     1.2      Members of the NRL corporate group may also share Personal Information with each other

     you from your parent or legal guardian.
 1.5 The NRL will collect Personal Information from you mainly through relevant forms (whether
     in hard copy or online) approved by the NRL or the Leagues from time to time. However,
     during the ordinary course of its activities and functions, the NRL may also collect Personal
     Information that is given to them by a third party (such as a corporate partner of the NRL or
     Clubs, or information that is on public record). This information from third parties forms part
     of your Personal Information.
 1.6 If the NRL collects Personal Information about you from someone other than yourself (or
     your parent or legal guardian), the NRL will take reasonable steps to ensure you are made
     aware of the matters listed in clause 1.7 below. Generally, if appropriate, the NRL will tell
     you why it is collecting Personal Information and how it plans to use it, unless it is
     impracticable to do so or it is self-evident.
 1.7 Before or at the time of collection of Personal Information (or if that is not practicable, as
     soon as practicable after), the NRL will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware
     of:
     (a)      how to contact the NRL in relation to this Privacy Policy;
     (b)      the fact that you can gain access to the information held on you;
     (c)      the purposes for which the information is collected;
     (d)      the organisations (or types of organisations) to which the NRL usually discloses
              information of that kind;
     (e)      any law that requires the information to be collected; and
     (f)      the main consequences (if any) for you if all or part of the information is not
              provided.
                                                                                                    2

2. USE AND DISCLOSURE

          other than the primary purposes (the secondary purpose) identified in clause 1.1 above
          unless:
          (a)      you have consented to the use or disclosure;
          (b)      both of the following apply:
                   (i)       the secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of collection and,
                             if the Personal Information is Sensitive Information, directly related to the
                             primary purpose of collection; and
                   (ii)      you would reasonably expect the NRL to use or disclose the information for
                             the secondary purpose.
   2.2    The NRL may use or disclose your Personal Information to a Rugby League Administrator
          for the secondary purpose of direct marketing communication, if the NRL has your consent
          for such use. In other cases, if the information is not Sensitive Information, the NRL may use
          the information for the secondary purpose of direct marketing communication only if the
          following are satisfied:
          (a)      it is impracticable to seek your consent before that use;
          (b)      the NRL will not charge you for giving effect to a request by you not to receive
                   direct marketing communication;
          (c)      You have not made a request to the NRL not to receive direct marketing
                   communication;
          (d)      the NRL always prominently displays a notice or actionable option that you may
                   express a wish not to receive any further direct marketing communication; and
          (e)      each written direct marketing communication by the NRL with you sets out the
                   NRL’s contact details including business address, telephone and fax numbers, and

   2.3    The NRL may disclose your Personal Information to its service providers such as ticketing
          agents, mail houses or other similar third-party organisations for the purpose of
          implementing the primary purposes, including implementing ticket requests and
          communicating Rugby League related offers. For example, the NRL uses third party credit
          card payment gateway services on its website. If you pay for tickets or services through the
          NRL’s website, the NRL will be required to provide certain financial details to the third party
          service provider to effect the transaction. The NRL requires these third party organisations
          to keep your contact details and Personal Information confidential and only use them for
          the designated purpose.
                                                                                                           3

                    game of Rugby League in their area and provide related activities and services; and
           (b)      unless you inform the NRL otherwise, disclose your information to sponsors and

           that is within its direct control from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access,
           modification or disclosure. However, the internet is an inherently risky environment and any
           information you send via digital means is sent at your own risk.
   3.2     The NRL will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify Personal
           Information if it is no longer needed for any purpose for which the information may be used

           Privacy Principles.
   4.3     Before supplying any Personal Information to you, the NRL must be reasonably satisfied as
           to your identity (for example, by asking to see your passport or driver’s licence). The NRL is
           not under any obligation to provide Personal Information to you where the NRL is not
