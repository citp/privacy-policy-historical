# NRSC Privacy Policy

The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of visitors to our website. Outlined below is our online privacy policy for information collected through our website and e-mail lists. If you have questions about these policies, please contact us by email at info@nrsc.org This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it or by phone at (202) 675-6000.

Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulations establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our sites to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested.

When you make a contribution to the NRSC through our site, any credit card information provided is only used to immediately process your donation. The NRSC does not retain your credit card information once the donation is processed online. The NRSC has put in place appropriate security measures to protect your personal and financial information. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving financial data from our site. In addition, our physical facilities are protected against the loss or misuse of information that we have collected from you at our site.

We use log files to assess the aggregate level of traffic on our site, including what pages people are visiting, and to diagnose any potential problems with the website. This log file does contain an "Internet Protocol" or IP address that gives us insight on the general geographic area that visitors are coming from but not information on a specific individual. We do not use log files to track a particular individual's use of our site. All users remain anonymous unless they choose to give us personally identifiable information.

Our site contains numerous opportunities for a visitor to forward documents, photos, and messages to friends and family. Some features of our site may allow you to store addresses for easy retrieval and reuse at a later time. This information is stored for your convenience. We do make use of cookies to personalize and customize your interaction on our site and to provide you with the best possible online experience.

This site includes very small files provided by one or more online advertising networks that help them more precisely to target advertising to users, based on users' activity on sites within those networks. These files do not access or use information by which users can be personally identified. If you wish, you can prevent these files from using non-personal information about you by either deleting the cookie folder in your browser or by putting your browser's Privacy setting higher, but doing so will mean that you will not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our, and other, websites -- and may well adversely affect your experience of websites that use cookies to enhance or personalize that experience. You find out how to make these changes to your browser at this site: [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ ](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/)

Under no circumstances will the NRSC sell your information to commercial entities. The NRSC may share information -- that you provide us -- with like-minded organizations committed to the principles or candidates of the Republican Party, Republican State Party organizations and local Republican groups. Occasionally, we may ask a Republican Senate campaign or state party to communicate with our e-mail activists on topics of breaking news we think would be of interest to you. The NRSC may provide your email address or other personal information to authorized third parties required to deliver a particular service. These third parties may not use said information for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for the NRSC.

Our site may contain links to other Web sites and servers. The NRSC does not bear responsibility for privacy policies or content on linked Web sites. Accordingly, you also agree and acknowledge that the NRSC will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance of any such content, services on or through any such site or resource or goods. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on each website you visit. The NRSC provides links to original articles written and maintained by third parties. These links are provided as a convenience and do not imply a claim of ownership in that content.

Should you wish to opt-out of receiving these emails, an unsubscribe link is included in every e-mail. If your link is not working properly, or you wish to communicate your desire to opt-out directly to us, please email info@nrsc.org This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it with "Unsubscribe" in the subject line.

While we do not intend to make any changes to this privacy policy we do reserve the right to do so. If any changes to this privacy policy are made, then the date that the revised or updated policy is posted to our site will appear at the bottom of the page.
