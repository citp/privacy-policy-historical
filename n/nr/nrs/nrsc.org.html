        <strong>Overview</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to the official website or mobile application (the Sites) of NRSC. </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy outlines our practices for collection, use, and disclosure of your information that you provide to us when you use our Site and other NRSC mobile
        applications that display this policy (the Sites). By using these Sites, you agree that your use of the Sites is governed by this Privacy Policy and our
        Terms of Service. From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically check this Site for updates. We will alert you to
        changes that have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. Your continued use of the Site affirms your agreement to any changes
        we make to this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>
        Please note the distinction between our privacy practices in connection with your visit to the Site, and our <a href="http://www.nrsc.org/terms-and-conditions/">Terms of Service</a>.
        </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Information Collected and how it is Collected</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Voluntary Information:</strong> We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us including your name, e-mail address, postal
        address, phone number, mobile number, and geographic location. You may provide this information when you request information, register, make a purchase,
        send us an email, sign up to receive email or text messages updates, connect through a social feed, fill out a form or for other purposes. We may also collect
        demographic information such as gender, date of birth, occupation, employer name and zip code. When this information is linked to personally identifiable
        information, it will be treated as voluntary personal information. In limited circumstances, we may collect payment information such as credit card number
        where needed to complete a requested service or transaction. Voluntary personal information does not include aggregate data (data about a group or category
        of users that has been stripped of identifiable information about individual users) that we may collect about the use of the Sites. This policy does not
        restrict our collection and use of such aggregate information. </p>
      <p>
        By requesting information to your mobile phone, we may obtain the following information from you in connection with our SMS service: your cell phone number, your
        carrier's name, and the date, time and content of your messages, as well as other information that you provide. We will use such information in accordance
        with this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Automatically Generated Information:</strong> We may also collect non-personally identifiable information that is generated automatically while you
        are visiting the Site or elsewhere on the Internet when our advertisements are served, also known as log files. This data includes, but is not limited to,
        information such as IP address, web pages visited before and after visiting the Site, date and time, domain type, type of mobile device you use, your device’s
        unique ID, web pages you view and links you click on within the Site and interactions with our advertisements delivered by us or advertisements delivered
        by a third party advertising technology vendor. This type of information may be collected using different types of technologies, such as cookies and pixels.
        An IP address, for example, is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. When
        you visit our Site, we may view the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. We use this information to determine the general physical
        location of the device and understand from what regions of the world our Site visitors come. We also may use your non-personally identifiable information
        to enhance our Site.</p>
      <p>
        All Site users remain anonymous unless they choose to give us their personal information. You may elect not to allow us to collect and use this non-personally identifiable
        data as part of our Service by following the Opt Out procedures described below.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cookies and Other Technologies </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Overview:</strong> We may use cookies and other technologies to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses the Site or visit
        a web site in our network. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser at the request of a website. Cookies help us improve
        your experience on our Sites, however, if you wish to block, erase or be warned of the use of cookies, please refer to the paragraph below entitled Disabling
        Cookies or to your browser manufacturer. When you view a video on our Sites, a third party may also set a “flash cookie” on your computer. Since removing
        and rejecting browser cookies may not also remove or reject flash cookies, you will also need to visit: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security" target="blank">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security</a> in order to delete or disable flash cookies. Rejecting or removing browser or flash
        cookies may affect certain features of our Sites. </p>
      <p>
        This website uses third party vendors such as Google to help analyze how users use the site. For example, Google Analytics uses cookies to collect standard Internet
        log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including IP
        address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the website and to compile statistical reports on website activity
        for the NRSC. </p>
      <p>
        Google Analytics collects information anonymously. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Neither the NRSC nor Google will
        link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a computer user. We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any Personally Identifiable
        Information from any source, unless you explicitly submit that information via a fill-in form on our website. It reports website trends without identifying
        individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site – for more information on opting out of being tracked by
        Google Analytics across all websites you use, visit <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="blank">this Google page</a>.
        <br>
        <br> We may use other companies to set cookies on our Site and advertisements and gather cookie information for us. In some cases, we may also use another company
        to operate web servers or process credit card purchases for our Site. The Site may use cookies and other technology to speed navigation and keep track of
        items and to gather anonymous traffic data that we may use to enhance the Sites, our Services, marketing, and other internal purposes. This Policy does not
        apply to, and the NRSC is not responsible for, cookies used by the third parties. If you select “remember me” on your computer when logging on to the Site,
        the NRSC will set a persistent cookie to store your username and password so that you do not have to enter it more than once. It also allows us to send confirmations,
        receipts, updates, alerts and support and administrative messages and otherwise facilitate your use of and our administration and operation of the Site.
        The persistent cookie also enables the NRSC to track and target the interests of users to enhance the experience on the Site. The persistent cookie is removed
        when you uncheck the “remember me” check box.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disabling Cookies:</strong> The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies,
        how to have the browser notify you when you receive cookies, and how to disable cookies altogether. Note that if you reject or block cookies, it may affect
        your ability to enjoy the full functionality and experience of our Site.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Web Beacons:</strong> Pages of our Site [and our e-mails] may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs,
        pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit the NRSC, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or [opened an e-mail] and for other related
        web site statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain web site content and verifying system and server integrity).</p>
      <p>
