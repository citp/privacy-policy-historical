# NRMP - Privacy Statement

The NRMP takes very seriously its responsibility to protect the safety and security of its Web site and information collected through the Web site. We recognize that users of the Web site and participants in NRMP surveys may have questions about how and why this information is collected. This Privacy Notice explains what kinds of information we collect and how we use this information, and describes your and our legal rights and responsibilities with respect to your personally identifiable information, which we will call "personal information" in the text below. This Privacy Notice is part of the terms and conditions that govern your access and use of our Web site. If you are unable or unwilling to agree to all the terms and conditions below, please do not access or use our Web site or you will have agreed to fully comply with all of our terms and conditions, including this Privacy Notice, and consented to the collection and use of your personal information as described below. We will refer to access, use, transmission, and exchanges of information, availability or utilization of features, functions or activities, simply as "use" in the material below.

The NRMP recognizes it has a responsibility to treat with care the personal information it collects about individuals and institutions involved in medical education arising from use of our Web site and to respect their privacy relative to personal information that may be sensitive. To meet those obligations, the NRMP has developed policies designed to prevent the disclosure, compromise, and unauthorized use of personal information without the permission of the individual involved, to limit the distribution of personal information to those situations that require it in order to perform our obligations related to your use of our Web site, and to permit distribution of non-personal information, such as directory information, wherever a useful purpose can be served.

### Personal Information

As part of its Matching Program, the NRMP collects certain personal information to provide you with the services requested and to engage in research for specific, defined purposes. Such personal information may include names, identification numbers, contact information, institutional affiliation, and other biographical information. This information is collected only through our password-protected Web site, the **Registration, Ranking, and Results SM (R3SM)** **** system.

In addition to using it for our Matching Program, your information also may be used by the NRMP for educational research or verification purposes or under restricted conditions by third parties as explained below in Data Sharing with Third Parties.

NRMP surveys are designed to collect data for educational and research purposes, including reporting to NRMP constituents and providing summary information to the U.S. Congress and other policymakers. From time to time, the NRMP may contact you to participate in such a survey. Whenever the NRMP conducts research using personally identifiable data (human subjects research), that research is reviewed by an external (to the NRMP) institutional review board whose responsibility it is to protect your interests.

The NRMP reserves the right to use personal information in its databases to confirm the identity of parties who may have made or attempted to make unauthorized or inappropriate use of NRMP services or assets or who may be a threat to public safety, including, but not limited to, denial of service attacks, unauthorized use of NRMP services, systems and/or networks, inappropriate email list activity, unauthorized use or distribution of NRMP intellectual property, or threats to the safety or privacy of the public. Contact information will be used to provide notice to the offending individuals and in such cases, personal information may be given to law enforcement if warranted or required by law.

### Credit Card Information

Once your credit card information has been passed to the credit card processing company for verification, we retain only a limited amount of the credit card information (e.g., several digits but not all of your credit card number and your address when available). Any credit card information we retain is kept within a secure, limited-access database. It is not shared with anyone internal or external to the NRMP, nor is it integrated with data from other NRMP databases.

### Web Site Usage Information

Email addresses, aggregate information about which pages visitors access, and information volunteered by Web site visitors—such as user survey responses and Web site registrations—are used to improve the content of the NRMP Web site. Some portions of our Web site uses cookies or other information tracking technology ("cookies"), to improve your experience and to help us administer, operate, and manage our Web site more efficiently. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you a chance to decide whether or not to accept it, but if you choose not to accept them, your use of the Web site may be limited and you may be required to re-enter certain information each time you wish to use our Web site.

Information published by the NRMP that is related to its Matching Program is accomplished using aggregate statistics. The NRMP may share personal information with certifying boards, licensing bodies, and other organizations involved in medical education for research, eligibility determination, verification, and credentialing purposes. Personal information also may be shared with medical education institutions upon direction by you as part of the registration or application process or for scholarship opportunities. The NRMP shares both non-personal and personal information with these parties under certain limited restrictions, including requirements to keep the personal information confidential, destroy the personal information once it no longer is needed for the intended purpose (except for applications to medical education institutions), and to prevent unauthorized release of personal information. The NRMP conducts such exchanges in a secure manner designed to protect against access by unauthorized parties. Rank order list information is never shared with third parties, except under court order or in response to a subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Other than for the specific purposes noted in this Privacy Notice or in any terms and conditions that otherwise apply to you, we do not share personal information and we never use or share any of your personal information for advertising or marketing purposes.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and facilitate the correct use of personal information obtained through our Web site, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we collect online. Access to personal information is restricted to NRMP staff members who require the access for specific purposes, such as providing services to you or performing research.

Messages you send to us through the Internet or otherwise electronically may not be secure. We recommend that you do not send any confidential information to us by email. **If you choose to send confidential information to us, you accept the risk that a third party may intercept this information.**

Access to your personal information is available through your NRMP login (AAMC ID). When you register for an NRMP match, you have an opportunity to correct or update most information you have provided using our Web site. In the alternative and in some cases to correct or update certain types of information (e.g., date of birth, name), you may contact the NRMP directly at the address below to report corrections.

To protect your privacy and security, we also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections following such a request.

Although the NRMP and the Association of American Medical Colleges (which hosts the NRMP servers) take measures designed to protect your personal information in their systems, you also must be vigilant in protecting access to your information online and assume responsibility for protecting personal information. Treat your user names and passwords with care. Do not share them or enter them into fraudulent sites. Be aware that legitimate NRMP and AAMC sites include "nrmp.org" and "aamc.org", respectively. Do not conduct NRMP or AAMC business with any sites that do not contain one of those addresses.

The NRMP has the right, at any time and from time to time, to make changes to this Privacy Notice. If the changes are material, we generally will provide at least 30 days� notice. Any changes to this Privacy Notice will be posted on this Web site and will be effective when posted unless another date is referenced in the notice. We recommend you check the Privacy Notice on a regular basis so that you know the current terms and conditions that apply to you, because if you use our Web site after any changes are effective, you are agreeing to comply with and be bound by them.
