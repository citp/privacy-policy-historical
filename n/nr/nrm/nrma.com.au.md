# Privacy, security & identity theft | NRMA Insurance

Please read this statement along with our Privacy Policy

We take the protection of your personal information very seriously, so we regularly revise and update our security measures to keep your information private and meet industry standards.  

### Steps we take to protect your information

  * We encrypt your information as it travels between your computer and our computers. We use a form of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to stop anyone intercepting your information
  * Your personal information is stored on computer systems which are protected by a combination of firewalls, secure logon processes, encryption and intrusion monitoring technologies
  * We use a recognised payment service provider to process any insurance payments you make using this website. This service provider is committed to protecting your personal information on our behalf
  * In certain circumstances we will collect and use your IP address to protect the security of our website
  * We regularly test our websites and infrastructure for vulnerabilities and take action where needed
  * We apply security patches to software provided by vendors



### Steps you can take to protect your information

It’s still very important that you take some steps to help keep up security when you’re online:

  * Protect your personal information, such as usernames, passwords and policy details, by not allowing anyone to see you entering them, and avoid public wi-fi usage
  * Notify us as soon as possible if you become aware of any security breaches
  * Use a strong password for your account. Try to think of something that is easy to remember, but hard to guess, such as a passphrase
  * Change your password regularly and try not to reuse the same password on more than one site
  * Don’t let your browser save your password for our websites
  * Be wary of websites, emails or phone calls that claim to be from us. Please contact us if you are unsure
  * Keep an eye on your accounts and check for any unauthorised transactions
  * Keep your devices up to date with firewall enabled, anti-malware software, anti-virus software and security updates



### How do you make sure you’re going to the right website?

Always go directly to our website by typing the address  **www.nrma.com.au**  rather than following links found in emails or elsewhere online.

### Keeping safe with email

  * Never disclose personal, financial or debit/credit card information by email. Contact us if you’re unsure of the legitimacy of any email that appears to have come from us

  * We will never ask for sensitive or personal information such as usernames, passwords or policy details if you haven’t asked for our help first




By helping us with these things, we can both work to make your world a safer place. To report any concerns around the security or privacy of your information please email [cybersecurity@iag.com.au](mailto:cybersecurity@iag.com.au)

### Enquiries, emails and email forms

To send an email to us, or to make an enquiry online, you will need to complete an email form available on this website.

### How information is collected

Information that is not capable of identifying you, such as the number of users visiting this website, is collected through code embedded in the webpages of this website. You cannot disable the code on these pages.

Other information, such as browser type, is included in a ‘cookie’ that is sent to your computer when you are completing certain tasks on this website. A cookie contains bits of information that enables our servers (ie. the computers that house this website) to identify and interact efficiently with your computer. Cookies are designed to provide a better, more customised website experience, and to make it easier for you to use this website.

You can configure your browser to either accept all cookies, reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent to your computer. The ‘help function’ on your browser will provide you with details on how to change your browser configurations. You will need to accept cookies in order to use some functionality on this website.

We may also use technologies similar to cookies in emails you receive either directly from us or from third party email providers sending emails on our behalf. These technologies help us understand whether you have opened the email, and how you have interacted with it. They also help us understand what you may find of interest and can assist us, for example, in tailoring the advertising we display to you on websites where we have an arrangement in place to serve advertisements. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way you can disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) within your email software, and you should not click on any links within the email (with the exception of the unsubscribe link). You can opt-out from receiving these emails at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link within the email.

### How we use information collected online - Selling or distribution of information

We do not sell, trade, lease or rent any personally identifiable information we obtain using this website, without your prior consent.

### Third Party Suppliers

From time to time we may use independent third party suppliers to gather information using code embedded in the webpages of this website. This information includes information such as the number of users and pages viewed and the path taken through this website. We use this information for statistical and maintenance purposes. We may also use independent third party suppliers to collect information from emails you receive from us or our email providers. This information includes information such as how the email has been interacted with, and visits to other websites. We also use other external companies and may disclose your personal and non-personal information to them for the following purposes:

  * Web hosting services for this website
  * Maintenance or problem-solving
  * To gather information from cookies in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our online activities

Due to evolving technologies and types of functionality available on this website, we encourage you to review this Online Privacy Statement from time to time as it may be updated.
