# NRDC Privacy Policy

The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) respects your right to privacy and is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust. We do not sell or rent any information you provide us through our website. We have created the following privacy policy to inform you about the ways in which we collect and use this information.

NRDC does not collect any information from you without your knowledge and permission, and we do not ask that you enter any personal information to access or use most areas of the NRDC website. In order to use some of the tools and functions, however, such as the online action center, you must enter some identifying information. NRDC does not disclose this information to anyone except 1) to identify you, as described in the following three paragraphs, to those you contact through our website and 2) to manage our website and database with the help of service providers, who are subject to a non-disclosure agreement. Information you provide NRDC is stored in a secure location and is accessible only by designated staff.

**Online Activism**  
To send a message from our online action center to government officials and other decision-makers you must identify yourself by name, address, email address and in some cases, phone number. NRDC includes this information when we send your message. This is necessary for your message to be effective, and in the case of many government officials it is required.

**Postcards and "Tell Your Friends" Pages**  
To forward an article, postcard or action alert you must enter your name, your email address and the email address(es) of anyone you are sending it to. NRDC includes your name and email address when we send your message.

**Other Places Information May Be Requested**  
In addition to information you enter when sending messages to friends and decision-makers from NRDC's website, you may submit information directly to NRDC for purposes including donating, subscribing to an email bulletin or entering a contest. NRDC will not disclose this information to anyone except in accordance with any rules you agree to as a contestant and, as described above, to manage our website and database with the help of service providers, who are subject to a non-disclosure agreement.

**Reviewing and Updating Your Information**  
You can review and update the information we have on record for you by going to NRDC's [Subscriber Profile Editor](https://secure.nrdconline.org/site/UserLogin?NEXTURL=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.nrdconline.org%2Fsite%2FConsProfileUser). If it's your first time using the profile editor, you'll need to provide your email address on the log-in page so we can send you a password.

**Communications from NRDC**  
If you have opted to receive any of our publications by email you are able at any time to unsubscribe by clicking a link that appears in the email publication itself or by visiting the Subscriber Profile Editor link in the previous paragraph.

When you provide NRDC with your email address and mailing address we may contact you to ask you to become a member of NRDC. You can choose not to receive such requests by contacting our membership department at [membership@nrdc.org](mailto:membership@nrdc.org).

**Secure Transactions**  
When you donate to NRDC via our website your donation information is encrypted and transmitted via a secure connection. NRDC uses your credit card information only for the purpose of processing your donation. We will not disclose this information except as necessary to process your donation and we do not store it once your donation has been processed.
