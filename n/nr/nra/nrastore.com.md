National Rifle Association of America Privacy Policy

Updated: April 25, 2007

Overview 

NRA realizes how important privacy is to our membership. Therefore, we have adopted the following policy to advise you of your choices regarding the use of your personal information online. This policy describes what types of information we gather about you, how we use it, under what circumstances we disclose it to third-parties, and your rights to update or correct it. 

Information We Collect 

We gather certain broad information about web site use including the number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the programs and services preferred. We look at the data in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. We gather this information so we can learn how many people visit NRA sites, which pages are the most and least viewed, and to identify which web sites are referring visitors to our sites. The data helps us determine the extent to which our members use certain parts of our web site. Thus, we use this information to help us in restructuring sites to better meet the needs of our members. 

Most NRA sites and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age. For sites of interest to our junior members, we are committed to complying fully with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Of course the NRA encourages you to talk with your children about communicating and disclosing personal information online. 

We compile lists for communications and marketing purposes. We will provide that information to NRA affinity partners who we believe provide goods and/or services that might be useful to NRA members. Contracts with these companies require them to keep the member information strictly confidential and prohibit them from using it for any other purpose. You may ask us to remove you from this list by (1) email: using our Contact Us page, (2) phone: at 1-800-672-3888, (3) mail: at National Rifle Association of America, 11250 Waples Mill Road; Fairfax, VA 22033. We do not provide member information to telemarketers, mailing list brokers, or other companies that are not offering NRA-endorsed services or benefits. 

Cookies 

Cookies are small pieces of text stored on your computer’s hard drive by a Web server. We use session cookies to identify your computer during a particular surfing session, I.E. when you are placing an order or signing into a site. Such cookies enable you to store your password for fast logon and to track the items you have placed in your "shopping cart" during a visit to our online stores. We do not store personal or sensitive information in cookies. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or to deliver viruses to your computer. 

Most web browsers provide you the ability to accept or decline cookies, as well as to be warned each time a cookie is being sent. If you choose to decline cookies, however, you may not be able to access certain interactive features and services offered on NRA sites. 

IP Addresses 

We collect and analyze traffic on our web site by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally. However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message. 

Personal Information 

You may be required to provide personal information, including your name, email address, home address, work address, or telephone number. Should you request particular services, you may be asked for additional information such as your billing address, credit card number and expiration date. For example, we may ask for information so that we can process your membership application, facilitate an online store purchase, create an online account or register for one of our events. We store this information to provide service for your membership account, send the products you purchased, and provide entry or registration to one of our events. This information may also be used to evaluate and improve services and programs we offer our membership. 

There will also be opportunities for you to provide us with additional information regarding your preferences and interests. This information, however, is not required and is completely optional on your part. 

Control of Personal Information 

Opt Out 

We also use your membership information to send you notices in the mail or by email about special member benefits, discounts, and offers. If you do not wish to receive these mailings, you can: (1) opt-out of email lists immediately by following the instructions at the bottom of the email, (2) email us using our Contact Us page, (3) call us at 1-800-672-3888, (4) write to us at National Rifle Association of America, 11250 Waples Mill Road; Fairfax, VA 22030. 

Editing Your Personal Information 

You may edit your personal information—change name and address information, etc.: (1) on our account maintenance web site, [www.NRAMemberServices.org](http://www.nramemberservices.org/), (2) call us at 1-800-672-3888, (3) write to us at National Rifle Association of America, 11250 Waples Mill Road; Fairfax, VA 22030. 

Data Security 

We protect your personal information by using technologies and processes such as encryption, access control procedures, network firewalls, physical security, and other measures. Whenever personal data is collected by an NRA web site the data is secured in transit by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL ensures that the data in transit between the web server and your client machine is encrypted and that the information was not changed in transit. Only authorized employees or agents with a legitimate business purpose are allowed to access your personal information. We have policies and procedures in place to deal with employees who violate our privacy and confidentiality policies. When credit card data is required, that data is additionally protected by internal encryption. Also, credit card data is only kept for the period of time required by our accounting processes and thereafter is purged from our system. 

Some of our services require you to establish and use a password to protect your personal information from unauthorized access by others. Please understand that the National Rifle Association of America is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites linked to our site or for the privacy practices of other third parties. When leaving an NRA site using such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should therefore check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser to determine its individual practices. 

Changes to This Policy 

The National Rifle Association of America may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When the National Rifle Association of America makes changes to this Policy, you will see the word "updated" and the effective date beneath the Privacy Policy title. The National Rifle Association of America encourages you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
