                <p>
                    NRA realizes how important privacy is to our membership. Therefore, we have adopted
                    the following policy to advise you of your choices regarding the use of your personal
                    information online. This policy describes what types of information we gather about
                    you, how we use it, under what circumstances we disclose it to third-parties, and
                    your rights to update or correct it.</p>
                <div class="header1">
                    Information We Collect</div>
                <p>
                    We gather certain broad information about web site use including the number of unique
                    visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the programs and services preferred.
                    We look at the data in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. We gather
                    this information so we can learn how many people visit NRA sites, which pages are
                    the most and least viewed, and to identify which web sites are referring visitors
                    to our sites. The data helps us determine the extent to which our members use certain
                    parts of our web site. Thus, we use this information to help us in restructuring
                    sites to better meet the needs of our members.</p>
                <p>
                    Most NRA sites and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly
                    collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age. For sites
                    of interest to our junior members, we are committed to complying fully with the
                    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Of course the NRA encourages you
                    to talk with your children about communicating and disclosing personal information
                    online.</p>
                <p>
                    We compile lists for communications and marketing purposes. We will provide that
                    information to NRA affinity partners who we believe provide goods and/or services
                    that might be useful to NRA members. Contracts with these companies require them
                    to keep the member information strictly confidential and prohibit them from using
                    it for any other purpose. You may ask us to remove you from this list by (1) email:
                    using our Contact Us page, (2) phone: at 1-800-672-3888, (3) mail: at National Rifle
                    Association of America, 11250 Waples Mill Road; Fairfax, VA 22033. We do not provide
                    member information to telemarketers, mailing list brokers, or other companies that
                    are not offering NRA-endorsed services or benefits.</p>

                    your "shopping cart" during a visit to our online stores. We do not store personal

                <p>
                    We collect and analyze traffic on our web site by keeping track of the IP addresses
                    of our visitors. IP addresses are unique numeric identifiers that are assigned to
                    each computer browser accessing the Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify
                    you personally. However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet
                    Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating
                    a message.</p>

                    address, home address, work address, or telephone number. Should you request particular
                    services, you may be asked for additional information such as your billing address,
                    credit card number and expiration date. For example, we may ask for information
                    so that we can process your membership application, facilitate an online store purchase,
                    create an online account or register for one of our events. We store this information
                    to provide service for your membership account, send the products you purchased,
                    and provide entry or registration to one of our events. This information may also
                    be used to evaluate and improve services and programs we offer our membership.</p>
                <p>
                    There will also be opportunities for you to provide us with additional information
                    regarding your preferences and interests. This information, however, is not required

                    Data Security</div>
                <p>
                    We protect your personal information by using technologies and processes such as
                    encryption, access control procedures, network firewalls, physical security, and
                    other measures. Whenever personal data is collected by an NRA web site the data
                    is secured in transit by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL ensures that
                    the data in transit between the web server and your client machine is encrypted
                    and that the information was not changed in transit. Only authorized employees or
                    agents with a legitimate business purpose are allowed to access your personal information.
                    We have policies and procedures in place to deal with employees who violate our
                    privacy and confidentiality policies. When credit card data is required, that data
                    is additionally protected by internal encryption. Also, credit card data is only
                    kept for the period of time required by our accounting processes and thereafter
                    is purged from our system.</p>
                <p>
                    Some of our services require you to establish and use a password to protect your
                    personal information from unauthorized access by others. Please understand that
                    the National Rifle Association of America is not responsible for the privacy practices
                    of web sites linked to our site or for the privacy practices of other third parties.
                    When leaving an NRA site using such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you
                    should therefore check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser
                    to determine its individual practices.</p>
