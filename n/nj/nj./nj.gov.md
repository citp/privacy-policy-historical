We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.

##### Other Important Information

  * **Information Provided on Someone Else's Behalf:** If you provide us with information about someone else, please ensure you have that person's permission to do so for the purposes detailed in this Privacy Notice.
  * **Public Access to Information in the State of New Jersey** : Laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by State government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public’s right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both State and federal laws. All the information collected at this site becomes public records that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists.
  * **Applications and Social Media Sites** : Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure of policies and practices, including the data security, of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the apps or our social media pages.

Updated and date-stamped versions will be posted on our services. Unless otherwise required under applicable law, the revised Privacy Notice will take effect immediately upon such posting.
  * **Minors:** We at the State of New Jersey are especially concerned about protecting children’s privacy. We hope parents and teachers are involved in children's internet explorations. It is particularly important for parents to guide their children when children are asked to provide personal information online. Through a link for students on the State of New Jersey homepage, we encourage children to send email messages with their feedback and suggestions. We specifically ask children to get their parents’ permission before providing any information online — at our site or any other site — and hope parents will always be involved in those decisions. Most importantly, when children do provide information through the State of New Jersey website, it is only used to enable us to respond to the writer, and not to create profiles of children.
  * **International Transfers:** The users of our services may come from all over the world. Therefore, we may, subject to applicable law, transfer your information, outside the country where you are located and where information protection standards may differ, _e.g._ , your information may be stored on servers located in other states, or even countries. We will utilize appropriate safeguards governing the transfer and usage of your personal information. If you would like further detail on the safeguards we have in place you can contact us directly as set forth in **"How Can You Contact Us"** below.
  * **Retention Period**. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

The URL in your browser will change to "HTTPS" instead of "HTTP" when this security feature is used. Your browser may also display a "padlock" or "key" symbol on its task bar to indicate a secure transmission. If these indicators are not present, information may be susceptible to interception by other parties. Most internet email communication is not considered secure. If you are communicating sensitive information, please consider sending it by postal mail or contacting the Agency by phone.
