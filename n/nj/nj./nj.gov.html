              at the State of New Jersey are especially concerned about protecting 
              children's privacy. We hope parents and teachers are involved in 
              children's Internet explorations. It is particularly important for 
              parents to guide their children when children are asked to provide 
              personal information on line. The State of New Jersey homepage for 
              kids encourages children to send email messages with their feedback 
              and suggestions. We specifically ask children to get their parents' 
              permission before providing any information on line -- at our site 
              or any other site -- and hope parents will always be involved in 
              those decisions. Most importantly, when children do provide information 
              through the State of New Jersey web site, it is only used to enable 
              us to respond to the writer, and not to create profiles of children</font></p>

              and information possessed by state government. At the same time, 
              there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records 
              that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions 
              are provided by both state and federal laws.</font></p>
