          the State of New Jersey are especially concerned about protecting children's 
          privacy. We hope parents and teachers are involved in children's Internet 
          explorations. It is particularly important for parents to guide their 
          children when children are asked to provide personal information on 
          line. The State of New Jersey homepage for kids encourages children 
          to send email messages with their feedback and suggestions. We specifically 
          ask children to get their parents' permission before providing any information 
          on line -- at our site or any other site -- and hope parents will always 
          be involved in those decisions. Most importantly, when children do provide 
          information through the State of New Jersey web site, it is only used 
          to enable us to respond to the writer, and not to create profiles of 
          children</font></p>
