### How We Share Information

We share the information that we collect from you with our affiliated companies, recruiters, and service providers. Recruiters may use your information to contact you directly. Additionally, when you apply for a job with an employer, the information you supply or share through our website may become part of that employer’s database. If your profile is accessed by an employer, your information may become a part of their database. In these instances, the use of such information by the recruiter will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for that company’s use of your information.

By applying to a job, providing your contact information to show interest in a job, or replying to a message from an employer, you consent to the disclosure of your information and communication with that employer for employment related purposes.

We attempt to limit access to our resume database to legitimate employers but we cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database for fraudulent purposes. Accordingly, you should use caution when storing sensitive information you would not want made public.

We may also share your information with third parties who provide specific technical services to aid the operation of the website including website hosting, credit card processing, and SMS and email messaging.
