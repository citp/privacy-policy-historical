# Njuice - Live breaking news, just for you

### Privacy policy

This agreement applies to the web site _Njuice_ located at njuice.com. 

## Data collection

  


  1. Njuice and some other services do not require any personally identifying information. 
  2. Njuice collects limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services. 
  3. Some of our services require you to register for an account. Njuice asks you for some personal information in order to create an account (typically your name, email address and a password for your account) and we will use that information to provide the service. For certain services, such as our advertising programs, we may request credit card or other payment information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. 
  4. Upon your first visit to Njuice, a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and to better understand how people interact with us. Njuice does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Njuice features or services may not function properly without cookies.

When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process such information only on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 
    3. We conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Njuice, its users or the public.
  2. If you have an account, we may share the information submitted under your account among all of our services in order to provide you with a seamless experience and to improve the quality of our services.

  3. We may store and process personal information collected on our site in Germany or any other country in which Njuice or its agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to the transfer of your information among these facilities, including those located outside your country. 
  4. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Njuice, such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice before any personally identifying information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
  5. We may share aggregated information with others. Examples of this include the number of users who searched for "Njuice" or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement.
