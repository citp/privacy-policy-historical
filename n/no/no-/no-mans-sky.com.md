On of the key elements of our Game No Man’s Sky is exploration. When exploring the No Man’s Sky environment, you may discover planets, alien bases, flora and fauna. If you are the first to do so, your discovery will be named after you, based on your No Man’s Sky username. Those names are viewable by other players.

As this is a feature of No Man’s Sky, we process this information in order to deliver No Man’s Sky to you under the terms of use agreed between us.

If you decide to stop playing No Man’s Sky, we will continue to use your username as the basis of the name of your discoveries. We do this in the pursuit of our legitimate interests.

**To help us improve the Online Services and fix any problems**

We may process information about you (including Basic Information, User Content, Registration Information, and Analytics) so that we can analyse and improve our Games and Online Services.
