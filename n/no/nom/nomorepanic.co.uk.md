# Privacy | No More Panic

> _At No More Panic we take the privacy of our members and supporters very seriously and we are committed to protecting your privacy online.._

This statement explains the privacy and the data protection practices which apply to all websites operated by NMP. A link to this Policy is available from all websites which it applies to.

In this Policy references to NMP or to “we” or “us” are to No More Panic.

Our aim is to safeguard our users’ privacy whilst providing a personalised and valuable service. Collecting personal information is necessary if we are to satisfy the expectations and requirements of our users, e.g. by communicating with them and providing an interactive service. We appreciate that you do not want the personal information you provide to us distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you have.

### We promise:

– To keep your data safe and private.  
– Not to sell your data.

### What information do we collect?

personal information such as name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth (where appropriate). We collect this information only in connection with specific activities, such as registration or membership requests, feedback, donations, shop purchases etc. The information is either needed to fulfil your request or to enable us to provide you with a more personalised service. You don’t have to disclose any of this information to browse our sites. However, if you do choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.

### How is the information used?

Any personal data relating to you will be used and recorded by us in accordance with current data protection legislation and this Privacy Policy. We will use the information you provide to:

  1. fulfil your requests, for example applications for membership, donations, participation in campaigns and provision of information;
  2. process donations, or other payments and verify financial transactions;
  3. identify contributors;
  4. provide a personalised service to you when you visit our websites e.g. by customising the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual user;
  5. record any contact we have with you;
  6. prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our websites and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf;
  7. in aggregate (and therefore anonymously) to profile your use of the websites and carry out research on our users’ demographics, interests and behaviour to help us gain a better understanding of how our users navigate and use the websites, and to enable us to improve our service to you; and
  8. provide you with information which we think may be of interest to you, as explained below.



If we contact you by email or text message, each time you receive a message you will also have the option to decline to receive further information from us in that manner.

We may disclose personal information if we receive a complaint about any content you have posted or transmitted to or from one of our sites, if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or personal safety of NMP, its sites or its visitors.

Except as indicated above we will not use or transfer this data to any third parties without your prior permission.

### Use of cookies

If you prefer not to accept a cookie, you can navigate around our sites like a normal user. Any information gathered by the use of cookies is compiled on an aggregate, anonymous basis.

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you should be able to change your browser to prevent that. You should read the information that came with your browser software to see how you can set up your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, this should then give you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a website if you do so. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the web.

Cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, such as providing personalised pages, but at present, we use them only to track people visiting our sites and the pages they view on the site.
