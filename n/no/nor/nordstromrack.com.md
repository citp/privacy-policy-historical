It allows us to better serve you in a number of ways, including keeping you informed on when your alterations, repairs, or your favorite brands or product will arrive, and notifying you about sales, special appearances and store events or promotions of interest to you. 

To best serve you, we record and access information in Personal Book, including your name, address, telephone numbers, email address, interests, privacy preferences and purchase history. All Nordstrom Salespeople are expected to use Personal Book in an ethical and appropriate manner. This includes only entering accurate customer information, voluntarily given by you to the Salesperson, for the specific purpose of entering it into Personal Book or any other Nordstrom-approved data device. 

Personal Book allows our Salespeople to follow through on our commitment to serving you in a professional manner, and we are dedicated to ensuring that the information you provide is protected and secure. Personal Book is the property of Nordstrom and may be used for Nordstrom-related purposes only. 

##  Our Salesperson Texting App "NEXT" 

Many of our customers want a better shopping experience that is personalized, relevant and intuitive. We are pleased to offer you the ability to opt-in for text messages with your individual salesperson as another way to communicate through our NEXT app. You who elect to enroll to receive text messages from your salesperson who uses our NEXT app may receive easy-to-check text messages about things such as fashion, recommendations, and reminders for upcoming sales, events and services. We hope the NEXT app helps you save time while allowing you to seamlessly opt-in or opt-out as you choose with your salesperson. Please see a salesperson to learn how to enroll. 

##  Video Recording 

We conduct video surveillance at our stores for security, fraud and loss prevention purposes and for incident reporting purposes. We use the images and information from such videos only as required for such purposes and for certain operational purposes, such as to measure traffic patterns in our stores. 

##  Mobile Privacy 

Nordstrom offers mobile applications (commonly known as "apps") that allow you to shop online, check product availability, learn about store events, or receive other information from Nordstrom. All personal information collected by Nordstrom via our mobile application is protected by this Privacy Policy.

Although you do not have to provide your location information to Nordstrom to use our mobile applications, our store-specific services such as find-an-item require a zip code to function. You may manually enter a zip code and we will save your zip code(s) for future reference. Alternatively, when you download our mobile application, you may choose to allow it to obtain your precise location from your mobile device when you click the "near me" button. In this case, we will determine your zip code from the precise location data received from your mobile device. We do not store precise location data; we only store the zip code associated with the location. We may also update our mobile applications to offer automatic (or "push") notifications. We will provide push notifications only to those customers who opt-in to receive such notifications from Nordstrom. If you have questions about location and notification privacy, please contact your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of you device to learn how to adjust your settings. 

In the future, we may offer updated or enhanced versions of our mobile applications that include additional features created by us or using third party functionality. Our applications or the third party may automatically collect information about your precise location from your device, but only if you allow it. 

##  Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Similar Technologies 

Our website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology. We use cookies and web beacons to identify your device, provide website user authentication, conduct fraud prevention and management services, distinguish you from other visitors, record your IP address and understand your use of our site, and identify the name of the Web site from which you linked to Nordstrom. This information is used for fulfilling contracts with our business partners, and to help us serve you better by improving our website design, as well as our products, services, and promotions. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites. Information obtained through cookies and web beacons may be shared with or obtained by service providers on our behalf. More information is available under Third-Party Advertising Partners.

A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser). A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie. 

When you visit our website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This Nordstrom-placed cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our website and in some cases, your email address. Your email address is only saved in this Nordstrom-placed cookie if you register with us. A web beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor's actions on a web site, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time, date, duration and number of page views, a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased. 

If you register with us, this Nordstrom-placed cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our website and provides you with access to your account information. If you save your information with or order from us, we may also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our website. If you have not saved your information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you. You can disable cookies at any time by using your browser options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our website. In addition, we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information. 

We may use Flash Cookies (also known as Local Stored Objects) or other similar technologies. A Flash cookie is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash technology that may be built into your computer or downloaded by you to your computer. We use these technologies to personalize and enhance your online experience, facilitate processes, personalize and store your settings. Flash cookies may help our website visitors to, for example, set volume preference associated with a video experience, play games and perform surveys. They help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to customers. We do not use Flash cookies for marketing or behavioral targeting purposes. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies and the cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. [ Learn how ](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html) to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies. If you disable Flash cookies or other similar technologies, please be aware that you may not have access to certain features and services that make your online experience more efficient and enjoyable. 

##  Third-Party Advertising Partners 

We use third-party service providers to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf across the Internet. 

These advertising service providers may collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website, and your interactions with our products and services. Such non-identifiable information does not include your name, address, email address or other personal information. The information is collected through the use of cookies and pixel tags (also known as action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites. 

In addition to the information about your visits to our website, our service providers may also use the information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from Nordstrom. 

Currently, we use third party-placed tracking pixels and cookies from the following advertising delivery partner: TellApart. In the future we may partner with other companies to provide interest-based advertising, both on and off Nordstrom.com. If this occurs, Nordstrom provides you with an opportunity to opt out when these advertisements are served. You may manage your third-party advertising preferences by clicking [here](http://privacy.thebrighttag.com/nordstrom/privacy-options.html). 

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices for not having this information used by third-party service providers, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>

##  Facebook Custom Audience Ads from Nordstrom 

We may display interest-based ads to you when you are using Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook called the Custom Audience Tool. This tool allows us to personalize our ads based on your shopping experience with us. We do not share any of your personal information, including your shopping history, with Facebook. The tool lets Nordstrom convert your email address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers Facebook generates from email addresses of its users. You may opt-out of Facebook Custom Audience ads from Nordstrom by clicking [here](https://nordstrom-fb-ad-optout.venturaassociates.net/). 

Nordstrom invites you to socialize and share your fashion inspiration, finds and purchases with your friends using Social Media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram. If you choose to use these tools, you may be sharing certain profile elements, including your comments. This sharing is subject to each social media program's privacy policies. We also use Facebook Social Plugins to allow Facebook to share information and friends' activities with its members while they are on our website. For example, Social Plugins allow Facebook to show you and your friends' "Likes" on our product pages if you are logged into Facebook while shopping at Nordstrom.com. Nordstrom does not receive or control any of the content from Facebook Social Plugins. To remove a Facebook "Like" through Nordstrom, place your cursor in the "grayed out" Like button and click on the "X" that appears. This removes the "Like" from your Facebook Page, as well as from Nordstrom's websites. You can also delete comments made while at Nordstrom.com from your Facebook Page. 

For more information about Facebook Social Plugins and other social media tools, [click here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/). 

We may allow you to sign in to your Nordstrom.com account using Facebook Connect. If you choose to do this, we may collect information necessary to facilitate social interactions such as friend lists, birthday, check-ins, basic profile information and your profile picture but only if the privacy settings you and your friends set within Facebook allow it. We will use the information we collect to create and facilitate an interactive social experience and to bring you products, services and programs from Nordstrom. Nordstrom will always comply both with its privacy policy as well as with Facebook Connect terms regarding use of Facebook profile information. 

##  Links to Other Websites and Services 

Websites provided by the Nordstrom family of companies may include links to other Internet sites, content, or videos (embedded or direct links) maintained by third parties ('Linked Sites'). Nordstrom provides Linked Sites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of Linked Sites does not imply endorsement by Nordstrom of the Linked Sites. You access Linked Sites at your own risk and by accessing them you leave Nordstrom's website. Linked Sites are not under the control of Nordstrom and Nordstrom is not responsible for the contents of any Linked Site, including the privacy policies or tracking technologies they may use. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy to determine how they will handle any personally identifying information they collect from you. 

##  Browser Do Not Track Signals

##  California Privacy Rights 

California law entitles residents to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties or with corporate affiliates (such as Nordstrom Bank, and HauteLook) for those entities direct marketing purposes. Nordstrom does not provide any personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. If you want to request a notice or have any questions about Nordstrom privacy practices, please contact us at [privacy@nordstrom.com](mailto:privacy@nordstrom.com). 

##  Children's Privacy 

Nordstrom will never knowingly request or collect personal information from any person under 13 years of age without prior verifiable parental consent. If you are under 13 years old please do not provide your information on our website.

##  Security 

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information transmitted to us using this website. To help guard your information, our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only Nordstrom is able to decode your information. Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information. 

To be sure your connection is secure, look at the bottom status bar of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) the SSL is active and your information is secure. Most browsers offer additional security alerts as well. If for some reason you are unable to connect to our secure server, please call us toll free at 1-888-282-6060. 

We also ask customers to carefully review their accounts and immediately report any unexpected activity to Nordstrom and their issuing bank or credit card company. Additionally, we are asking all our customers to take measures to help protect personal information in their online accounts, including the following: 

  * Install the latest security updates and anti-virus software on your computer or mobile devices to help prevent malware and viruses 
  * Reset your email account password 
  * Use complex passwords (a minimum of 7 alpha/numeric cAsE sEnsitive characters) 
  * Do not use the same password on more than one website 
  * Do not share your password with others 
  * Password protect your personal mobile device(s) 
  * Sign out/log off website sessions so that your session is closed and cannot be accessed by another user on the same computer, especially when using a public computer or terminal

##  Fraud Alerts: Protecting Your Personal Information 

You may come in contact with websites, emails or texts that try to lure you into providing personal information such as an offer of a Nordstrom gift card. Nordstrom does not sponsor these offers nor are we affiliated with the promotion originators. If you become aware of any potentially fraudulent activity on a website or in an email or text, please forward the information to [onlinefraud@nordstrom.com](mailto:onlinefraud@nordstrom.com) or call us at 1-888-282-6060 so that we can follow up. We take these matters, and the protection of our customers' sensitive information, very seriously. [View](http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/fraud-alert) our Fraud Alerts page. 

##  Data Processing and Storage 

Nordstrom and its third party service providers may process or store your personal information outside of the United States or Canada and other countries. In accordance with the laws of those countries, in certain circumstances your personal information may be accessible by foreign law enforcement, regulatory bodies or other authorities. For more information of our use of foreign service providers please contact us as described below. 

##  International Customer Privacy 

Protecting the privacy and security of Nordstrom customer information is a top priority for Nordstrom. In some cases, Nordstrom partners with outside vendors to help facilitate transactions. When that is the case, we work closely with the vendor to ensure that the transaction is appropriately handled and all the information you provide is treated with the utmost care. 

To sell and fulfill online purchases that customers choose to ship internationally, Nordstrom partners with Borderfree, Inc. ("Borderfree"). We have contracted with Borderfree to assure that they will carefully process your personal information, with at least the same level of privacy protection set forth in the [Safe Harbor Privacy Principles](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018475.asp) as established by the U.S. Department of Commerce and approved by the European Commission. Borderfree also agrees not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for executing international shipping orders. When you identify your Nordstrom.com order as being shipped internationally, Nordstrom will facilitate your secure Checkout transaction with Borderfree. On the Checkout page you will be required to submit credit card and personal information (name, billing address, shipping address, email address and phone number) to Borderfree to complete your order. Once you place your order, you will be prompted to confirm whether you would like to receive future marketing communication from Nordstrom. 

Upon completion of your order, Borderfree will notify Nordstrom of the approval of your order, and Nordstrom will then ship approved orders to Borderfree. Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you. In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. When ordering a product, you will be presented with Borderfree's terms and conditions to which you must agree in order to receive the product(s) you ordered. 

Once you have agreed that Borderfree may share your data collected from their page with Nordstrom, that data is protected by the Nordstrom Privacy Policy. Any personal information you provide directly to Nordstrom while on Nordstrom.com is controlled and processed by Nordstrom, PO Box 21986, Seattle, WA 98111-3986. Any personal information provided at Checkout is controlled and processed by Borderfree, 55 West 39th Street, 18th Floor, New York, New York 10018. 

If you choose to provide Nordstrom with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States. Nordstrom adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles as established by the U.S. Department of Commerce and approved by the European Commission and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Authority. We conduct an annual self-assessment to verify that we are in compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles in addition to our own Nordstrom privacy program assessments. Nordstrom has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union that our processing of personal data is in compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, as has Borderfree. For more information about the Safe Harbor, visit the Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor [website](http://export.gov/safeHarbor/). While the Safe Harbor Principles are designed to protect personal information originating in the European Economic area and Switzerland, our policy is to protect all international customer information in accordance with these Principles. 

Customers shipping internationally who wish to inquire about or update personal information or change marketing preferences, or anyone who wants to receive information about our international privacy program should contact us directly using one of the following methods: 

  * Send an email to [intl_privacy@nordstrom.com](mailto:intl_privacy@nordstrom.com), or 
  * Call our international privacy customer line at 206-233-5678, or 
  * Write us at Nordstrom International Privacy, PO Box 21986, Seattle, WA 98111-3986 



In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, Nordstrom commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Nordstrom using one of the following methods: 

  * Send an email to [intl_privacy@nordstrom.com](mailto:intl_privacy@nordstrom.com), or 
  * Call our international privacy customer line at 206-233-5678, or 
  * Write us at Nordstrom International Privacy, PO Box 21986, Seattle, WA 98111-3986 



Nordstrom has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Nordstrom, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR web site at [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints](http://www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints) for more information and to file a complaint.

##  Business Transitions 

As we continue to develop our business, we may undergo a business transition such as acquiring another company, merging with an existing company, or selling a portion of our assets. In such transitions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. In the unlikely event that Nordstrom, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired or enter a court proceeding, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that your personal information can continue to be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

##  Policy Changes 

This policy replaces all previous disclosures we may have provided you about our information practices. We reserve the right to change this policy, and to apply any changes to information previously collected, as permitted by law. If there are material changes to this policy or our information practices change in the future, we will notify you by posting the policy changes on our website.
