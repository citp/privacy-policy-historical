# Northrop Grumman - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy  
  
**

Northrop Grumman makes reasonable efforts to protect your personal information. Northrop Grumman’s privacy program and data security activities are governed by a number of policies and procedures. With respect to personal information about individuals (“data subjects”) located in European Union (EU) countries, Northrop Grumman also adheres to a self-regulatory program that complies with the safe harbor privacy principles set forth in the July 2000 agreement between the EU and the United States Department of Commerce. For more information about the Safe Harbor Program, please go to [http://www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor).

Northrop Grumman collects, processes, and stores personal information for the following purposes:

  * determining, evaluating, and implementing employment-related actions and obligations.
  * designing, evaluating, and administering compensation, benefits, and other human resources programs.
  * designing, evaluating, and implementing employment-related education and training programs.
  * monitoring and evaluating employee conduct and performance.
  * maintaining plant and employee security, and health and safety.
  * collecting and storing customer information.
  * making data subjects' names, images, and other items of business-contact information available by means of website posting, business cards, brochures, and other promotional media to Northrop Grumman's present and potential customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, other business associates, and employees.
  * maintaining business records relating to past, present, and potential customers, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners, other business associates, and employees.
  * conducting auditing, accounting, financial, and economic analyses.
  * facilitating business communications, negotiations, transactions, conferences, and compliance with contractual and legal obligations.



If the company intends to use personal information about EU data subjects for reasons that are not consistent with the above, the affected data subject will be given the opportunity to opt-out of that use or transfer. Sensitive information (e.g. medical or health condition, racial or ethnic origin) will not be used or transferred for purposes inconsistent with the above unless the affected data subject expressly agrees to such use or transfer. The company may transfer personal information to a third party acting as its agent (e.g., consultants, tax advisors and preparers, accountants, auditors, lawyers, financial services and benefit vendors) if the third party confirms that it provides the same level of protection required by the safe harbor principles. In such case, notice and choice are not provided to the data subject unless the company intends the agent to use personal information for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected. Notice and choice are provided to data subjects if the personal information is transferred to a third party who is not an agent of the company.

Individuals with complaints or safe harbor issues should contact their local Human Resources representative. Individuals with safe harbor issues who do not have access to resources internal to Northrop Grumman should contact the company via the company’s Internet site, [http://www.northropgrumman.com](http://www.northropgrumman.com/).
