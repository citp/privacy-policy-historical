## The Types of Personal Information We Collect

To order from this website, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on the registration form. During registration and account creation, you are required to provide your contact information (such as name, address, phone number and email address) and you are also required to create a password. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. 

Once you have created an account, you are then able to order prescription drugs as well as over the counter drugs. For orders for over the counter drugs, we request no additional information other than that which has been provided during the registration and account creation process as mentioned above. To order prescription medications, we will require additional medical information about the patient (which may be you or a family member) for whom the prescription has been ordered. This information includes: name, height, weight, date of birth, gender, the existence and types of drug allergies, medications requested, medical history information, details of your existing medications, prescription information, and the name of your primary physician and his or her contact information. 

The choice to provide us with personal information is always yours. However, your decision to withhold particular details may limit the products and services we are able to provide and makes it more difficult for us to advise you or suggest appropriate alternatives. If we are unable to accommodate your request based on the information that has been provided, we may ask for additional details in order to serve you best. We may also maintain a file containing contact history that is used for customer inquiry purposes. We may collect anonymous/non-personal information. Anonymous/non-personal information is information that cannot be associated with or traced back to a specific individual or business entity. 

## The Purposes for Which We Use Personal Information

We use your or your family members' personal information to communicate with you, send you newsletters, enhance your visit to our site, process orders, and effectively provide the products and services you have requested. We may provide your or your family members personal information to a licensed physician to review and approve your prescription. We may use personal information to send you notices and special offers via email. You may opt out of these emails at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in these email notices/offers. 

We will not furnish personal information to an outside organization for its use in marketing or solicitation without your prior consent. 

We use personal information only for the purposes that we have disclosed to you. If for any reason your information is required to further a different purpose, we will notify you and ask you for your consent before we proceed. Only the information specifically requested is disclosed and we will take precautions to satisfy ourselves that the authorities who make the request have legitimate grounds to do so. We may disclose personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website, if necessary, in certain limited circumstances such as a medical emergency, suspicion of illegal activity, or to collect on a delinquent account. We sometimes contract outside organizations to perform specialized services. Our trusted service suppliers may at times be responsible for processing and handling some of the information we receive from you. When you visit our website, information is not collected that could identify you personally unless you choose to provide it voluntarily. You are welcome to browse the website at any time anonymously and privately without revealing any personal information about yourself. 

If NorthWestPharmacy.com is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. 

## Agents/Service Providers

We use other third parties such as affiliate dispensing pharmacies and fulfillment centers to fulfill orders, ACH check processing companies to bill you for goods and services, and an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf. When you create an account with us to purchase prescription and non-prescription products, we may share your name, address and medical profile information (i.e. height, weight, date of birth, gender, the existence and types of drug allergies, medications requested, medical history information, details of your existing medications, prescription information, and the name of your primary physician and their contact information). 

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes. 

NorthWestPharmacy.com does not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy.

## Security Measures

We use current technologies and maintain security standards to ensure that your personal information is protected against unauthorized access, disclosure, inappropriate alteration or misuse. All safety and security measures are also appropriate to the sensitivity level of your information. Electronic client files are kept in a secure environment with restricted access. We manage our server environment appropriately and our firewall infrastructure is strictly adhered to. Our security practices are reviewed periodically and we employ current technologies to assist us in protecting the confidentiality and privacy of your information. In the course of daily operations, we attempt to restrict access to personal information to authorized employees who have a legitimate business purpose and reason for accessing it. As a condition of their employment, all employees of NorthWestPharmacy.com are required to abide by the privacy standards we have established and to follow all applicable laws and regulations. Unauthorized access to and/or disclosure of client information by an employee of NorthWestPharmacy.com is strictly prohibited.
