# Privacy Policy - Aviva

**What “we” means** This privacy policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva Group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva Group that  **processes**  your  **personal information**.

**We have separate privacy notices for our products**

If you’re one of our customers, we will give you separate privacy notices when we ask for your  **personal information** , for example, when you get a quote or apply for our products. Read them carefully, as they’ll tell you which Aviva company is responsible for managing your  **personal information**  and provide more details about how we’ll use it in relation to that product.

You’ll find more privacy notices when you use our apps and platforms such as Drive or MyAviva. This Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.

We’ll keep this Policy up to date with the latest legal requirements, so please check back here for the current version.

**Sensitive information**

Sometimes we’ll ask about your  **health,**  details of  **offences and convictions**  or other sensitive information about the person(s) who is/are being insured and their family members. We know how sensitive that data is, so protecting it is a top priority.

Automated decision making

We need your  **personal information**  when you apply for a policy to decide if we can offer a policy and, if so, on what terms.

We may supplement the information you provide with information from third parties who can provide more information about your vehicle or property (including  **DVLA**  databases, land registries and commercially available property databases).
