# Nordstrom Customer Privacy

We respect your privacy and take great care to safeguard information in our possession. Your preferences for use of your information are our highest priority.

The Nordstrom family of companies (Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, Nordstrom.com, Nordstrom fsb, Nordstrom Canada, HauteLook, Inc., Jeffrey and Trunk Club, Inc.) takes seriously the protection and proper use of your personal information, including social security numbers. In this policy, we may use "we," "our," "us" and "Nordstrom" to refer to the Nordstrom family of companies.

Nordstrom does not share customer information (including email addresses) outside the Nordstrom family of companies unless it is necessary to provide you with products or services available from Nordstrom. We may also disclose information when you tell us to do so, to identify or contact you, to protect your rights or the rights of Nordstrom, or as required or permitted by law.

Even within the Nordstrom family of companies, we restrict access to your information to those individuals who need it to provide you with products or services available from Nordstrom. Any third-party companies we use to provide you with products or services are required to keep your information secure and confidential.
