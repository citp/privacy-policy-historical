**Visiting Our Website**  
  
This Site enables users to search divine's Special Collection, a large collection of premium materials including books, magazines, databases, and newswires not available from any other search engine. The Site and our search services may be used by any user, but Special Collection materials generally are made available for a fee on a per document basis or as part of paid subscription. **Information We Collect On-Line and How We Use It**  
  
**PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**  
Personally identifying information is generally available to us only if you supply it voluntarily through our Web site or in connection with a purchase. For instance, in setting up your Member Account or a Promotional Account, we collect certain types of personal information such as your name, credit card number for Member Accounts, and e-mail address. For our corporate or Enterprise Accounts, we collect information such as name, phone number, fax number, company address, industry type, and number of potential users, related to the particular authorized user for billing and reporting purposes for the corporate account holder. Other information that identifies you personally may be collected by us through comments or suggestions submitted through our site. We do not collect any additional information from third parties.

You are required to establish an account in order to fully access and purchase Special Collection materials or other pay-per-view content. Any personal information that you share with Northern Light® will be used for limited internal purposes, including processing your transactions, customer service, marketing, development, content processing, content classification and providing you with information regarding our services, and our monthly newsletter. Please note that if you do not wish to receive our monthly newsletter, you can opt out. With Member or Promotional Accounts, we do not share your name, e-mail address, credit card numbers, mailing address, purchasing history or any other personal identifying information that is collected from this Site with any third parties, except as necessary to process your transactions. However, you should be aware that for certain co-branded sites, some information may be shared with a Strategic Ally as further described below. For Enterprise Accounts, personal information such as the user name or identification and purchasing history may be shared with the Enterprise Account holder. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our employees, customers, or the public.

 **E-MAIL ADDRESSES**  
We collect e-mail addresses as part of providing services. We may send you e-mails from time-to-time for customer service or our own marketing purposes. In limited circumstances, your e-mail address may be shared with our Strategic Allies, where Northern Light's technology is used to power the searches for the Web site of another company, as described further below. Except as is described in this policy, we will not disclose your email address to any third party without your consent. If you do not want us or one of the Strategic Allies listed below to contact you about any promotional opportunities you can let us know by opting out. **INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN**  
We do not intend, and this site is not designed, to collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you should not provide information on this Site, and should ask a parent to do so for you. Member and Enterprise Accounts are only available for individuals that are 18 years old or older. **AGGREGATE AND "CLICK STREAM" INFORMATION**  
We collect aggregate information about you and your use of our services, whether you have an account or not. For instance, we may collect various forms of click stream information such as IP address information, entry and exit points for our Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), search terms, site traffic, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. Such aggregate information generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you. If we do correlate any aggregate information to you specifically, we will do so for our internal use only and will not disclose such information to any third party. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all aggregate information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. **COOKIES**  
We may make use of "cookies" on our Site or those of our Strategic Allies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by the Web server through a user's browser. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from your computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the use of the site based on information stored in the cookie or host server. Therefore, cookies allow us to automate access and data entry functions of our Site such as login information, correlate online ordering information for purchases you may make while at the Site (if any), tailor the Site to your preferences or interests, or customize promotions or marketing. In addition, cookies allow us to track usage of the Site to determine those areas of the Site which are useful or popular and those that are not thereby enabling us to improve and update the Site effectively. 

You may adjust your Web browsers to either alert you of the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, you can click on the "Start" button and then select Control Panel, Internet Options and the Security tab. If you click on the "Custom" button, you will be able to see the cookie options. For Netscape users, in the browser, select File, Preferences and then Advanced to view the cookie options. Be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, some parts of the Site may not function properly or permit access.

  
**Strategic Allies**  
  
We have entered into a variety of strategic relationships with other organizations, such as those listed on our [Allies Page](https://web.archive.org/enterprise/clients.html), often to provide Northern Light's search and content technology. As part of our service, we may provide aggregate information for accounting purposes to our Strategic Allies. In addition, we may be required in limited circumstances to share some personal information with a Strategic Ally for certain custom sites or other specialty service offerings. Such sites and services typically are maintained under a different or sub-level domain name (e.g., usgovsearch.com or usgovsearch.northernlight.com). For such specialty sites or services, we will notify you as to whether personal information is shared with our Strategic Ally in a separate privacy policy on that specialty site or service. Therefore, whenever you access a new domain or sub-domain name or see a specialty site or service containing the Northern Light® name or logo and that of a third party, you should refer to the privacy policy for that site since its terms may vary from this policy.

In no event will we share any credit card or similar financial information that we collect from our Site with our Strategic Allies. Any personal information that is shared with a Strategic Ally is considered confidential information to be held in confidence by us and the Strategic Ally, and will not be sold, used or otherwise disclosed to a third party.

  
**Links to Other Sites**  
  
A link from our Site to another site does not imply endorsement of that site. We do not control the sites to which we link and assume no responsibility for their content or privacy policies. Therefore, you should carefully review all terms and conditions that apply to any site you access from our Site.   
**Updating and Access to Your Information**  
  
You can update your account information, get a refund, review your transactions, close your account or log out of your account by clicking on the [Accounts](http://standard.northernlight.com/cgi-bin/acctsrvc.pl) button on the left hand side of the home page. After you enter your username and password, you will come to your personal information screen. Click on the Update Accounts button to update and access your account.    
**Opting Out**  
  
If you are an account holder, and do not want us or any Strategic Ally to send you promotional material (material other than your billing statements and account information), you can either close your account.
