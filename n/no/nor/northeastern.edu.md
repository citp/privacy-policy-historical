For more information on Google Analytics privacy practices, [read here](http://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en "Google Analytics privacy practices").
  * Functionality – Used to enhance the performance and functionality of the Site and our Services.



Advertising – We sometimes use cookies from third parties that enable such parties to serve ads to you based on your visit to our Site These “interest-based” advertisements are also known as “online behavioral advertising.” Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across websites and over time. Although we do not share Personal Data with the third parties that conduct interest-based advertising operations on our behalf, these third parties and their affiliates do collect certain information as a result of their javascript “tags” and other technologies such as web beacons or pixels being used on our Site. The information that they collect includes the names of web pages you view (URL’s), unique identifiers, your IP address, timestamp, and certain types of technical information.

Local shared objects (“Flash” cookies) are associated with non-browser software like Flash Player. Local shared objects can be used like cookies to distinguish your device from others, but will not be deleted or blocked using browser cookie controls. Please visit adobe.com to learn how to delete and block Flash cookies.

HTML5 local storage enables browsers to distinguish your device from others and remember data that may be important for the functioning of the website. Typically HTML5 local storage is only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted. Please check your browser software for how to delete HTML5 local storage.

E-tags are used to prevent duplicative downloading of content to your browser, which can enhance browser performance. E-tags use unique identifiers for content that can also be used to distinguish your browser in certain instances from others. Typically e-tags are only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted. You should check your browser software for how to delete e-tags in your particular case.

Our mobile applications may use the following technologies for features, services, advertising, or analytics:

  * Collection of device identifiers, such as Android ID, MAC address, or UDID
  * Collection of geolocation, including precise geolocation



##### Sharing Cookies and Technical Information with Third Parties

We have relationships with authorized third-party providers whose services are accessed through the myNortheastern portal or other University website. We may automatically send one or more of your cookies to the third-party site or service to enable you to access third-party services without re-entering your myNortheastern user ID and password, or other required information, each time.

##### Your Privacy And Choices

On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive a notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. Please see the links below for guidance on how to modify your web browser’s settings on the most popular browsers:

  * Internet Explorer
  * Mozilla Firefox
  * Google Chrome
  * Apple Safari



If you reject, turn off or block cookies, some parts of our Site may not function correctly. Also, blocking cookies will not stop third-parties from collecting IP address, data stored in “Flash” cookies, and certain other types of technical information that may uniquely identify your browser.

You can make decisions about your privacy and the ads you receive. You can control whether companies serve you on-line behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website and using its opt-out: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>. The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser. If you are located in the European Union, visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s Your Online Choices opt-out tool here.

As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block browser cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and browser cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software.

##### Digital Marketing and Ad Networks

Third Parties May Collect Personal Data from Other Sources. Some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, on which it can display relevant advertisements.

#### SECURITY

We take reasonable administrative and technical steps to protect the Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction and, where feasible, systems that solicit or display personally-identifiable information are protected by authentication and authorization controls and Web-based experiences involving personal information are generally secured by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer protocol) with 128-bit encryption. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

#### RETENTION

We will keep your Personal Data pursuant to our retention schedules which authorize retention for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, while we have a legitimate business need to do so, or as required by law (e.g. for tax, legal, accounting or other purposes), whichever is the longer.

If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt out of receiving these communications and in accordance with our policies.

To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no longer Personal Data.

Legitimate Interest. “Legitimate interests” means our interests in conducting our business as an institution of higher education, and managing and delivering the best Services to you. This Privacy Policy describes when we process your Personal Data for our legitimate interests, what these interests are and your rights.

#### PUBLICLY POSTED INFORMATION

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you elect to post to any public areas of the Site. This includes, but is not limited to, comments to Northeastern University blogs or forums. Comments posted to public areas may be viewed, accessed and used by third parties subject to those third parties’ privacy practices and policies.

#### LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

Please read the privacy policies of these sites before you visit them to understand their privacy practices and policies.

#### DO NOT TRACK

Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Our website does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser.

#### FORWARDING EMAIL: STUDENTS’ PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS

If you forward email from your University-assigned email address to a private (non- Northeastern University) email address, we may send email to either or both addresses. We may also share your private email address with service providers inside and outside the University.
