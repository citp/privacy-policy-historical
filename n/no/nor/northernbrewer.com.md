# Privacy - Northern Brewer

**[](http://www.northernbrewer.com/)**

Northern Brewer knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting northernbrewer.com or interacting with Northern Brewer in any other way, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy notice.

**_What Personal Information About Customers Does Northern Brewer Gather?_**

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience. Here are the types of information we gather.

_Information You Give Us._  We receive and store any information you enter on our web site or give us in any other way.  You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.  We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.

You provide most such information when you search, buy, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide information when you search for a product or place an order through Northern Brewer; provide information in your account (and you might have more than one if you have used more than one e-mail address when shopping with us); communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; use our services such as Brewing TV; compile wish lists or other gift registries; participate in discussion boards or other community features; provide and rate reviews and specify a reminder. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, and phone numbers; credit card information; people to whom purchases have been shipped, including addresses and phone number; people (with addresses and phone numbers); e-mail addresses of your friends and other people; content of reviews and e-mails to us; and personal description and photograph in your account or profile.

_Automatic Information.  _We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many web sites, we use cookies  and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses northernbrewer.com or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Northern Brewer on other web sites.

Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to create features like top sellers; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call our 800 number. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our Web site for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. We may also collect technical information to help us identify your device for fraud prevention and diagnostic purposes.

_E-mail Communications._   If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please contact us and adjust your customer communication preferences.

_Information from Other Sources._  We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

This website uses social media plugins. Even without being a user of these social media sites, your IP-address is transmitted to the servers of the social media company.

Examples of information we receive from other sources include updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.

**_How does Northern Brewer Share the Information It Receives?_**

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we do not sell it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with parent companies that control us and subsidiaries we control that either are subject to this privacy notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this privacy notice.

_Third-Party Service Providers_.  We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail (catalogs, postcards, gift cards, etc) and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

_Business Transfers._  As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, business units or the entire business. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Northern Brewer or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. Please be aware that we may transfer your personal information to the [European Union] or to another country where privacy standards may not be equivalent to those in your country.

_Protection of Northern Brewer and Others._  We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Northern Brewer, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

_With Your Consent._  Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

**_How Secure Is Information About Me?_**

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

**_What Choices Do I Have?_**

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such features as your account, wish lists and customer reviews.

You can add or update certain information on pages such as your account. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.

If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please contact us to adjust your communication preferences though if you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of this website, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.

The help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Northern Brewer’s essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Northern Brewer products and services that require you to sign in.

**_Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions_**

If you choose to visit northernbrewer.com or interact with Northern Brewer in any other way, your visit and interaction and any dispute over privacy is subject to this notice and our conditions of use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the State of Minnesota. If you have any concern about privacy at Northern Brewer, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our privacy notice and the conditions of use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, but you should check our web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
