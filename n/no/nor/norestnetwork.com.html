 <strong>
  User Information
 </strong>
 </h5>
 <p>
 When you use this Site, including, for example, when you click on any of our links, we will collect and store in one or more of our databases, one or more of the following types of information ("Data"): your IP address (the domain name or other locator indicating your access to Internet); the IP address of the Website from which you linked to our site operating system; browser data; email address data; the date and time you access our Site and its functions, and any other accessible online user, biometric or device information. We will often collect Data at several points throughout the Site, its links and through related functionality.
 </p>
 <p>
 We use Data to measure the number of visitors, to provide our marketing partners, licensees, purchasers and successors in interest with accurate Data and to prevent fraud.
 </p>
 <p>
 Sometimes, we will ask you to provide, on a strictly optional basis, "Optional Information," such as your name, username, address, zip code or telephone number or other personal information.
 </p>
 <p>
 The only personally-identifying information we collect and store about you is the information you, voluntarily choose to provide to us, such as your name, e-mail address, address, zip code, telephone number, etc., in response to a specific prompt that requires you to initially enter the information. In addition, we, our agents, affiliates, Third Party Program Participants and others may ask you to voluntarily provide additional personal information for billing, shipping and other similar purposes.
 </p>
 <p>
 When a Site user, requests web pages from the Site's server, or otherwise uses the Site's services or other functionalities, we or our agents may automatically collect some information or data about the user and the user's Site use, including the IP address from which the Site is being accessed, the pages or links that were requested, the special preferences or requests of the user and cookie information received from the computer of the user. You agree that all such information and other Data may be collected and used by the Site and its agents.
 </p>

 </p>

 <strong>
  Cookies
 </strong>
 </h5>
 <p>
 We use cookies for your convenience. For example, we use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate and otherwise use our Site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can be used to "remember" what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move between and interact with Web pages and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. The Site also uses cookies to store and sometimes track information to make your online experience easier and more personalized and for other purposes related to your use of the Site and related services. For example, because a cookie can be linked to information you have inputted or which has otherwise been collected, the need to repetitively enter certain information, such as your username or email address, can be eliminated. The use of cookies also assists us in acquiring important Site usage Data. Cookies can also assist us in tracking and targeting the interests, preferences and desires of our Site users to present the most appropriate messages, offers and other communications to our users, and to generally enhance their experience at our Site.
 </p>
 <p>
 Currently, there are two general types of cookies commonly used in association with typical Web sites including our Site: "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies. A session or "session ID" cookie is functional only during the current "session" use of your browser, i.e., it ceases to function when you close you browser. A "persistent" cookie remains on your hard beyond the current browser session. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "Help" file. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
 </p>
 <p>
 Most major Web browsers are set up so that they will initially accept cookies, but you may modify your computers preferences to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to disable the ability of third parties to download a cookie to you. If you choose to reject cookies, or disable your computer's ability to receive or process them, there are areas of this Site, other related web sites and related services that may not function properly.
 </p>
 <p>
 You may obtain further information about "cookies" and how they function at: http://www.cookiecentral.com or http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm.

 <strong>
  Clear GIFs ("Web Beacons")
 </strong>
 </h5>
 </li>
 <p>
 Clear GIFs, otherwise known as "web beacons"or "single-pixel GIFs", are very small web page graphics that contain a unique digital identifying means. They function like cookies, in that they are often used to track and measure online actions taken by web site users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded into the graphics, text or other components of Web pages, including pop up windows, or in other digital documents that can support them, like email messages. We may also use Web Beacons to optimize search engine functionality. Clear GIFs are nearly invisible and are often only the size of small dot, such as a period at the end of a sentence. Also, like cookies, Clear GIFs, help us and our Third Party Program Participants measure and improve Site efficiency and effectiveness. For example, we may use web beacon technology to access your personally identifiable information or compile aggregated statistics about overall Site usage.
 </p>
 <p>
 Many of our Third Party Program Participants and advertisers also employ Clear GIFs on our Site and in related sites.

  Log Files
 </strong>
 </h5>
 <p>
 The Company and Third Party Program Participants, through the functionality of the Site, related sites and related services, gather Data and other information regarding Site navigation and Site use from cookies, clear GIFs and other means and store such information in log files and other databases. This Data and similar information includes date and time recordation data, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, Internet service provider (ISP) data, referring or exit pages, your computer's operating system and components, such as your browser type, and other data. While this information generally does not directly identify individual users, it does provide us with Data and other broad demographic information. We use this information for a number of purposes including Site usage analysis, analysis of Site navigation by users, determining and analyzing overall user preferences and user trends, Site administration, and general improvement and optimization of Site efficiency and effectiveness and user communications, including promotions to users. We may also provide third parties with some or all such information and other Data collected.

 </p>
 <p>

Some Offers may be presented to you with the option to express your preference by either clicking or entering "accept" (or alternatively, for example, "yes") or "decline" (alternatively "no") or "consent" or by indicating your preference regarding participation or non-participation by some other recordable means. By selecting accept, yes, consent, or some other affirmation of participation, you shall be deemed to agree that such action(s) shall constitute an "OPT-IN" to the Offer related to the action and that the you thereby agree and assent that your personal information, Data, Optional Information and other information in the Site's databases may be disclosed to the Company, the Company's affiliates, agents, Third Party Program Participants and other third-parties offerors.

 <p>
 "OPT-OUT" Rejection of Offers Otherwise Accepted. Some Offers may be presented with a pre-selected preference or choice. If you do not deselect the pre-selected preference of choice (i.e. "OPT-OUT" of the Offer) then the Site may transfer your personal information to the Company, its affiliates, agents, Third Party Program Participants, and any other third party making the Offer. If you deselect the pre-selected preference (i.e., reject the Offer) then no personal information relating to the Offer in the Site's database may be disclosed to a third party offeror of that particular Offer with respect to that particular Offer. Nothing herein shall limit information collection or transfer that you have previously authorized or subsequently authorize, including, without limitation any authorization regarding the third party offeror with respect to another Offer.
 </p>
 <p>

 <strong>
  Third Party Program Participants and Others
 </strong>
 </h5>
 <p>
 We may send you offers on behalf of Third Party Program Participants. Acceptance of some Offers through the Site may require you to provide personal information to Third Party Program Participants. These Companies may also independently send you Offers. If you would like to opt-out or cancel any such Offers or prevent Third Party Program Participants from independently communicating with you, you will need to inform them separately pursuant to their process for doing so.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Company shares aggregated demographic and Site navigation information, Data, Optional Information and other information with Third Party Program Participants, advertisers, analysts and others. We may also sell access to our mailing lists, including email lists, and other information to brokers and third party advertisers and we may transfer your information to such third parties. We may transfer some or all of your information to a purchaser of all or part of our Company or any successor in interest in the Company or the Site. We may also hire contractors or other third parties to perform any Company, Site or Site service function with or without notice to you. The Company and its agents may also aggregate demographic and other information about you and other Site users in databases and disclose, license or sell such information to Third Party Program Participants and other parties.
 </p>
 <p>
 By your use or continued use of the Site or acceptance of any Offer associated with the Site, you expressly agree that this Privacy Policy, all Data, Optional Information and other information collected by the Company, its agents, affiliates, Third Party Program Participants and all other third parties associated with the Company or the Site, all contractual rights and all rights arising under the Terms and Conditions may be freely and unconditionally transferred, assigned, sold, leased or licensed to any person or entity and that all Offers are subject to change and may be terminated by the Company or any third party initiating the Offer, with or without notice.

  Disclosure
 </strong>
 </h5>
 <p>
 The Company will not disclose or use any of your personally identifiable information except to the extent set forth in this Privacy Policy, or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Site's Terms and Conditions, defrauding the Company or any third party, including any Third Party Program Participant.
 </p>
 <p>
 The Company will disclose your personal information, without notice, to a party unrelated to the Company if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with the law, legal process served on the Company or a Third Party Program Participant, to protect the rights or property of the Company or a Third Party Program Participant, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public at large.
 </p>
 <p>
 All unsolicited information provided to the Company or any affiliated party, including, without limitation, any Third Party Program Participant, entirely on the initiative of a person providing the information or that person's agent, or any information which is provided independently of any request by the Company or its affiliates shall be deemed to be public information regarding which neither the Company nor any other person or entity has any duty to the information provider or any other person, and as such, the Company may use such unsolicited information in an unlimited manner.

In some circumstances you might be required to actively "accept" or "agree" to a new Privacy Policy or to new or modified provisions in the Privacy Policy in order to continue using the Site or services provided by the Company or Third Party Program Participants.
