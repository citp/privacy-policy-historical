> _If this sort of thing interests you_ , we would like your feedback on this Privacy Policy and our Terms & Conditions. My hope is that we will make changes as your use of the new version of nohashs evolves over the coming months. Feel free to email me directly with any questions, comments and suggestions. 

Nohashs knows that you care about how your personal data is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. How we do that is written in this Privacy Policy (the "Policy"). By visiting nohashss websites and nohashs's mobile applications and any other platforms nohashs owns or controls and makes available to you (collectively, the Services), and/or using any other linked pages or blogs, features, content (including any information, text, graphics, photos, lists of items complied by you, comments, reviews, links, or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on, or linked to the Services), or applications offered from time to time by nohashs in connection therewith (collectively the Content), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Policy and you give explicit consent to nohashs for the collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information by us, as described in this Policy. 

Any personal data provided to or gathered by the Services is controlled by nohashs LTD(" _nohashs_ "). 

####  1\. What Does This Policy Cover 

This Policy covers nohashss treatment of personal data that nohashs gathers when you access the Services and/or use the Content. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that nohashs does not own or control, or to individuals that nohashs does not employ or manage. 

####  2\. What Personal Information Does nohashs Collect 

The information we gather enables us to personalize and improve our services or complete a transaction on your behalf. 

We use the information to deliver the Services to you and, amongst other things, to: process payments, communicate with you about your orders, as well as products, services and promotional offers; administer your accounts and update our records; display Content such as "My nohashss" and recommend merchandise and services that might be of interest to you; improve our store and platform, prevent or detect abuses of our Services and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf. 

We retain personal information no longer than is legally permissible and delete personal information when it is no longer necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy. We collect the following types of information from our users: 

#####  i. Personal Data You Provide to Us 

We receive and store any information you enter on the Services or provide to us in any other way. The types of personal data collected include your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password, home and billing address, shipping address, credit card information and any other information necessary for us to provide the Services, including the usernames and passwords for your accounts and profiles on third-party sites with which the Services interoperates. You may also choose to provide us with a profile photo. 

We use the information we collect from you to provide the Services to you and improve the Services and the Content. The personal data you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, developing new products, completing transactions on your behalf, protecting nohashs and our users and communicating with you about nohashss products and services, including special and new features. 

We also use the information we collect to send you product news and updates (such as when items or brands you have told us that you following or are interested in become available), newsletters, marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you. For example, depending on your email notification settings, we may send you instant, daily or weekly "sale alert" updates that include new products you may like. You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating your account settings (or through other settings we may provide). 

We will collect details of transactions you carry out through our Services and of the fulfilment of your orders. Saved card details will never be shared with third parties unless we need to in order to process your order, and only using our secure systems. These details will be fully encrypted and only used to process card transactions which you have initiated. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third party business partners' to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of that personal data. 

If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. 

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features (see section 9 below for further information on the choices you have). 

#####  ii. Personal data Collected Automatically 

a. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use another feature of our Service. nohashs automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information (please see our Cookie Policy for further information, and the page you requested. 

b. More generally, our Services automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Services and its components, similar to user music preference data or to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. nohashs only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Services or another feature of the Content so that we can make the Services appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve the Content. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Content. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Content, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, nohashs never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, unless it needs to in order to complete a transaction on your behalf. nohashs only discloses information to third parties it trusts. 

#####  iii. E-mail Communications 

We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from nohashs if your computer supports this type of program. nohashs uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. 

#####  iv. Mobile Apps 

When you download or use apps created by nohashs or its affiliates or subsidiaries and, where applicable, have requested or consented to location services, we may receive information about your mobile device and your location, including a unique identifier for your device.
