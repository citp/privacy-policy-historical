# Privacy Policy

Last updated June 27, 2018

Not Doppler Pty Limited (ABN: 28 158 472 363)("Not Doppler") is committed to ensuring our website (www.notdoppler.com) is a fun and safe environment. Not Doppler does not actively run a user registration system, forum, chat or instant messaging function and thereby does not directly collect any personally identifiable information about our users except for persistent identifiers (cookies) used in our advertising and analytics operations as noted below. Some games featured or hosted on Not Doppler that are managed by third-party publishers may contain features such as user registration systems, forums, chat rooms and so forth; which are not managed by Not Doppler and are dictated by the privacy policy of the game's publisher.

Not Doppler does however collect some basic browsing related data for advertising and analytics purposes. Please consult the below privacy policy which contains further details:

**Cookies and data collected:**  
Not Doppler collects information about the way visitors and players are using our website through the use of Google Analytics and its related cookie(s). The goal of collecting this data is to make better informed decisions about what games our users are more likely to enjoy and to help improve the experience on Not Doppler. The type of information that Google Analytics collects includes browser and operating system type, country, pages visited, time spent on site, date/time stamp and broad demographic information. Google Analytics does not collect any sensitive information, and personally identifiable information is limited only to the cookie stored for tracking purposes. This data collected remains anonymous and is aggregated for any analysis.

Certain games on Not Doppler will create "Local shared objects" which allow the game to save game progress so that when you return you can pick up from where you left off. These save files are usually stored on your own computer and not shared with any third parties. However for games that are multi-player or include the use of a server with a user account system, this data may instead be stored in a cloud-based service. In this instance, storage and retrieval of such data is dictated by the privacy policy of such game publisher offering the service.

Please see Advertising section below for further details on cookies.

**Advertising:**  
Not Doppler is a free to use website and generates revenue through third-party advertising on the website. Without the support of this advertising Not Doppler would not be able to provide new games every Thursday. These third-party advertising companies may collect and use information about your visits to this and other websites to help determine which advertisements are most suited to your interests and measure performance of any advertising campaigns. In order to collect this information, the third-party may use a cookie or other such methods including javascript codes. Not Doppler has no influence over the policies of third-party advertising networks (except our ability to discontinue using their services).

The information they collect may be considered personally identifiable, or it could be considered personally identifiable in certain circumstances. This information is only ever used for our legitimate business interests and will never be sold or shared by us.

Nevertheless, the data is provided to us by third parties. While we use all reasonable commercial endeavours to ensure that they adhere to any applicable laws, we encourage you to familiarise yourself with their data policies.
