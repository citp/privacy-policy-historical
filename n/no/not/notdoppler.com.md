# Privacy Policy

Last updated June 16, 2015 Not Doppler Pty Limited ("Not Doppler") is committed to ensuring our website (www.notdoppler.com) and any published mobile apps (under the publisher name: Not Doppler or Not Doppler Pty Limited) are fun and safe environments. Not Doppler does not actively run a user registration system, forum, chat or instant messaging function and thereby does not directly collect any personally identifiable information about our users except for persistent identifiers (cookies) used in our advertising and analytics operations as noted below. Some games featured or hosted on Not Doppler that are managed by third-party publishers may contain features such as user registration systems, forums, chat rooms and so forth; which are not managed by Not Doppler and are dictated by the privacy policy of the game's publisher. 

Not Doppler does however collect some basic browsing related data for advertising and analytics purposes. Please consult the below privacy policy which contains further details: 

**Cookies and data collected:**  
Not Doppler collects information about the way visitors and players are using our website through the use of Google Analytics and its related cookie(s). The goal of collecting this data is to make better informed decisions about what games our users are more likely to enjoy and to help improve the experience on Not Doppler. The type of information that Google Analytics collects includes browser and operating system type, country, pages visited, time spent on site, date/time stamp and broad demographic information. Google Analytics does not collect any personally identifiable information about you on Not Doppler (such as name, address, email, phone number) and thus all data collected remains anonymous and aggregated for any analysis.

Certain games on Not Doppler will create "Local shared objects" which allow the game to save game progress so that when you return you can pick up from where you left off. These save files are usually stored on your own computer and not shared with any third parties. However for games that are multi-player or include the use of a server with a user account system, this data may instead be stored in a cloud-based service. In this instance, storage and retrieval of such data is dictated by the privacy policy of such game publisher offering the service.

Please see Advertising section below for further details on cookies. 

**Advertising:**  
Not Doppler is a free to use website and generates revenue through third-party advertising on the website. Without the support of this advertising Not Doppler would not be able to provide new games every Thursday. These third-party advertising companies may collect and use information about your visits to this and other websites to help determine which advertisements are most suited to your interests and measure performance of any advertising campaigns. In order to collect this information, the third-party may use a cookie or other such as javascript codes. Not Doppler has no influence over the policies of third-party advertising networks (except our ability to discontinue using their services).

If you would like more information about advertising practices and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, you can visit Google's Advertising and Privacy page: <http://www.google.com.au/policies/technologies/ads/>

**Opt Out of targeted advertising on Notdoppler.com:**  
Targeted advertising using browser behaviour is designed to ensure users see more relevant advertising based on their interests. If you prefer not to see targeted advertising from our advertising partners you can opt out of these services by following the below links:

**External Links:**

Not Doppler is designed for persons aged 13 over, and those under 13 should not browse the website without direct parental supervision. While Not Doppler does not offer any forums, chat rooms, user registration systems or similar mechanisms where information can be shared, if you have concern that information related to the privacy of children has been submitted to Not Doppler, please contact us at [contact@notdoppler.com](mailto:contact@notdoppler.com) **Help and Support:**

From time to time, Not Doppler also allows users to provide feedback or answer survey questions to help improve the quality of the website. Any information (including name or email address) that is submitted to Not Doppler via any means of communication will never be shared with a third party and will only be used to help answer any questions or troubleshoot any problems that are raised directly in the communication.  **Not Doppler on your Mobile:**  
Not Doppler also publishes and sells mobile games for the iOS and Android mobile platforms.
