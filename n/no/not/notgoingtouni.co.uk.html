<p>© Copyright 2008 Not going to uni Ltd. Please read our Privacy Policy. This website is published by Not going to uni Ltd, 4a Oakwood Parade, Oakwood Hill, Loughton, Essex, IG10 3EL and is registered in England No 06464163. VAT number 945064126</p>       
<h4>Why we collect your data?</h4>  
<p>By collecting your data, it allows us to understand what your needs and wants are, provide personalised content and match the most relevant adverts and services for you. It also allows us to provide targeted offers and services you may be interested to hear about.</p>
<h4>Data Protection Principles</h4>  
<p>Not going to uni Limited complies with the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. The eight principles relating to the processing of personal information are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fairly and lawfully processed</li>
  <li>Processed for a limited time</li>
  <li>Adequate, relevant &amp; not excessive</li>
  <li>Accurate</li>
  <li>Not kept longer than necessary</li>
  <li>Processed in accordance with your rights</li>
  <li>Secure</li>
  <li>Not transferred to countries without adequate protection</li>
</ul>
<p>Your privacy and security is of utmost importance to us. We will always follow these principles and ask you how you would like us (or our partners) to communicate with you. The Information Commissioner regulates compliance with the Data Protection Act.</p>
<h4>Marketing consent</h4>  
<p>By returning or submitting a form with your personal information to us or your continued use of our services, you consent to:</p>
<p>a) our processing your personal data for the above purposes; and</p>
<p>b) the transfer and processing of your information in countries outside of the European Economic Area which may not provide the same level of data protection as the UK. If we do make such a transfer or if your personal information will be processed outside of the European Economic Area, we will put a contract in place to ensure your information is protected or where applicable covered by the US "Safe Harbor Program".</p>
<h4>Marketing consent</h4>  
<p>If you are an existing customer we will keep you informed of product developments that relate to these products and services.</p>
<p>When you give us your personal information, we will give you an option to receive additional ongoing marketing communications from us which may include offers and news of alternative products and services.</p>
<p>We do not sell our customer data to other companies to use for their marketing purposes outside of notgoingtouni.</p>
<p>All of our marketing communications will have a method to unsubscribe.</p>
<p>Please note: Many products or services include personalised communications as part of their package; users will be given the opportunity to control the receipt wherever possible. In the event that the product or service consists entirely of communication (e.g editorial bulletins) this may take the form of unsubscribing from the specific communication.</p>
<p>If you purchase or redeem an offer with us, we may need to disclose your personal information to our partners, suppliers and subcontractors in order to process your order, fulfil deliveries, complete billing and invoicing transactions and to inform delivery and logistics planning.</p>
<p>We may supply personal data to trusted suppliers for analysis purposes. This will be done under agreement with us and will be in line with this policy.</p>
<p>We will work with other companies for promotional purposes where readers may be asked to opt in for future contact from that specific partner. With your permission we will transfer that customer data to the third party at which point it will fall under their own privacy and security controls. Not going to uni Ltd cannot be held liable for subsequent issues arising from third party usage of transferred data.</p>
<h4>Disclosure</h4>  
<p>Your personal information will be disclosed where we are obliged or permitted by law to do so. If you post or send offensive or objectionable content anywhere on or to any of our websites or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any of our websites, we can use the information that is available to us about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant third parties such as your employer and law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.</p>
<h4>Cookies and IP Addresses</h4> 
<p>When you visit one of our websites, we may send you a cookie. A cookie is a small file placed on your computer for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cookies help us to recognise you when you come back to our websites and to note the advertisements displayed to you. This helps us to choose adverts that we think are more relevant to you. We may use the services of third party ad servers for this purpose.

<h4>Payment and credit checks</h4> 
<p>Customer data will be used to take payment for products and services and may be used to verify credit details related to this payment. Permission to do so is implicit in providing financial details to process payment. Direct Debit information may be retained for ease of renewal of services.</p>
<p>If you apply for credit then to help us to make credit decisions about you, to prevent fraud, to check your identity and to prevent money laundering, we may search the files of credit reference agencies who will record any credit searches on your file. We may also disclose details of how you conduct your account to such agencies. The information will be used by other credit grantors for making credit decisions about you and the people with whom you are financially associated for fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and occasionally for tracing debtors.</p>
<h4>Personalised content</h4> 
<p>The content on our website/s and in our email communications may be adjusted depending on what we know about the content, products and services that you like. This means we can highlight content and articles that we believe will be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Advertising content may be adjusted depending on personal information. In some instances, this targeted advertising may be created by third parties and the information will be collected and held by these third parties outside not going to uni.</p>

<p>When you register online with our website's, you can see, review and change your personal information. Please ensure you update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.

It will then be securely deleted.</p>
<p>When readers enter into a conversation with any of our sites or other media, for example through the use of polls, comments, text messages, email, phone, radio or letters we reserve the right to display this content indefinitely in any relevant context subject to our editorial judgement.

As such, this personal data may be viewed, collected and used by third parties over whom we have no control. We are not responsible for either the information you submit/post or otherwise make available in such public areas or any use that may be made of such information by any third party.</p>
<p>When you give us information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them, to consent to the processing of their personal data, including sensitive personal data and to the transfer of their information abroad and to receive on their behalf any data protection notices.</p>

<p>When you request to have your profile removed from further marketing offers from us, you will be added to a suppression list to ensure your request is complied with. All personal data is processed in line with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 and The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.</p>
<h4>Information Requests</h4> 
<p>You have a right to ask for a copy of your personal information from us which we may hold about you (for which we charge a small processing fee) and to ask us to correct any inaccuracies in your personal information (which is free).</p>
<h4>Notification of changes</h4>
