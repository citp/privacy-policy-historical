# Privacy and Cookies - The University of Nottingham

References in this privacy policy to "The University", "we", "our", and "us", etc. are references to us, The University of Nottingham. 

The University is committed to protecting your privacy and respecting the confidentiality of information which you provide when you visit our website at <http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/>. At the same time, we want to try to ensure that you obtain full value from our website and from the services which you may want to receive via our website. 

The University is registered as a data controller under the Data Protection Act 1998 (the "1998 Act"). [The Data Protection Register](http://www.ico.gov.uk/ "The Data Protection Register") is open to view. We uphold the relevant data protection principles and process all personally identifiable information about you ("personal data") in accordance with the 1998 Act and other relevant legislation. This privacy policy explains what information we may collect about you when you visit our website and how we may use it. 

You should read this privacy policy in conjunction with the University's website [terms of use](https://web.archive.org/utilities/terms.aspx "terms of use"), of which this privacy policy forms a part. By agreeing to our terms of use, you are consenting to our processing of your personal data in accordance with this privacy policy. Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted on our web site and, where appropriate, notified to you by email. 

##  The information we collect 

It is possible to use our website without providing any personal data. However, the University may automatically collect certain information about you when you use our website, including by our use of "cookies" (see below), such as the IP address of your computer and the dates and times of your visits. 

In some areas of our website the University may ask you for personal data, such as your name, address and email details, that will enable us to make your site visit a more rewarding experience for you and/or to contact you after your visit. Examples of this might be where you complete an online form asking for a copy of a prospectus or to book a place on an open day with us, where you ask for information about a job vacancy, or where you subscribe to an online newsletter. 

In some other areas of our website, where you can register as an online user, the University may ask you for more detailed information about yourself. An example of this is Nottingham Alumni Online, which, amongst its various other services, enables former students to make contact with each other. In order to provide these types of services, it may be necessary for us to collect and process additional personal data, such as information about your educational history. 

##  How we may use this information 

Personal data which we collect about you via our website is held on and processed by computers situated at The University of Nottingham. The University will retain this data for a reasonable period or for as long as the law requires. 

The University will not disclose any of your personal data collected via our website to any third party, other than in circumstances set out in this privacy policy and/or where you have given us permission to do so, unless we are required to do so by law. 

The University may use personal data collected from you via our website to manage and monitor use of our website. Otherwise, we will only use this personal data for the purposes for which it was collected, unless you have given us permission to use it for other stated purposes. For example, if you supply us with your name and address so we can send you a prospectus for a particular department, and at the same time you agree that we may send you similar information in the future, we may subsequently invite you to an open day at that department. 

There may be circumstances in which the University will ask you to agree to us disclosing your personal data to certain third parties, or transferring it outside the United Kingdom. However, we will not do this without your permission. For example, if you use Nottingham Alumni Online, we may ask you to agree to us transferring your personal data to countries outside the United Kingdom, including those which do not have equivalent data protection legislation to the 1998 Act. This is because some alumni are likely to be located outside the United Kingdom, and the global nature of the Internet is such that making personal data available to others on our website is likely to involve the transfer of this personal data to other countries. However, before transferring your personal data in these circumstances, we will do our best to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy.  

If at any time you want to withdraw any permission you have given us to provide you with services, or to use your personal data in any other way, please inform us by [email](mailto:data-protection@nottingham.ac.uk "email").
