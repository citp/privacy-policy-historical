### Tracking Tools:  Cookies, Web Beacons and other Technologies

We may use tracking tools to serve you with interest-based advertising and to better understand your behaviors and browsing activities.  We might permit third parties to gather information through our websites, including for behavioral advertising purposes.  You can opt out of online behavioral advertising by going to [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

Cookies.  A cookie is a small file placed on your computer when you visit a site that can be understood by the site that issued the cookie.  We use cookies to monitor how our sites are used and to help personalize your online experience.  For example, when you register on our sites, we may store a unique code in a cookie on your computer.  The next time you come back to the site from that computer, our servers use the cookie to recognize you.  We can then use the information you provided when you registered, combined with your activities, on our sites to provide you advertising and offers of interest.  Most browsers automatically accept cookies.  Your browser gives you the ability to delete or reject browser cookies.  If you block cookies, certain features on our website may not work.  We do not store any sensitive personal information about you in the cookie.  If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.

Web Beacons.  Web beacons are small bits of code embedded in web pages or in emails.  We may use web beacons to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited a web page, and to understand usage patterns.  We also may include web beacons in e-mails to learn if messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

  * Web Session Variables.  Information that is passed from one web URL to another as you browse.
  * Brower plug-ins/add ons.  Additional web components that you may need to be installed to enable certain web features on our sites.  You have the option not to install these components.



### Information Sharing, Service Partners and Affiliates

Third-party service providers.  We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of services on our behalf.  In so doing, we may need to share your personal information with them.  Please note that we provide our service providers with only the personal information they need to perform their services and require that they protect this information and not use it for any other purpose.

For example, we may rely on a service provider to:

  * Host our sites and deliver our email messages.
  * Contact contest winners, manage payments or take other actions on our behalf.
  * Analyze data, sometimes combined with other sources, to send more targeted communications to you.
  * Conduct research and analyze data to improve our products, services and sites.



In addition, we may also rely on a service provider to:

  * Combine personal information about you that NBF has collected with personal information about you that our business partner has collected so that we can jointly send tailored promotional communications to you.  In such instances, our business partner will not have direct access to any information we share about you with the service provider, and only the service provider will be allowed to use the combined set of information to send you joint communications that we hope will be of interest to you.  If you prefer not to receive these joint communications, you can always opt out by following the instructions provided in any such communication or by logging in to your account on Nothingbundtcakes.com and changing your communication settings.
  * Perform other services that we request.



We provide these companies with the personal information they need to provide these services on our behalf.  We require these companies to protect this personal information and to not use the information for any other purpose,

Other situations.  We may disclose your personal information:

  * If NBF, a NBF entity or business is sold to another company
  * To protect and defend the rights and property of our customers, the public, or NBF (including enforcing our Terms and Conditions); and
  * When we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with law, regulatory requirements or requests from public authorities.



Aggregated and non-personal information.  We may share aggregated information that cannot identify you for general business analysis.  For example, we may disclose the number visitors to NBF sites or services.

### Information Security

We use technical, administrative, and procedural measures in an attempt to safeguard your personal and other information from unauthorized access or use.  No such measure is 100% effective though, so we do not guarantee that your personal and other information will be secure from theft, loss, or unauthorized access or use, and we make no representation as to the reasonableness, efficacy, or appropriateness of the measures we use to safeguard such information.  Users are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their own passwords.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us by contacting us at <https://www.nothingbundtcakes.com/contact-us>

Please note that email may not be encrypted and cannot be considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.  NBF will never ask you to submit your credit card information via email.

### Children’s Online Privacy

Like you, we have children of our own and are concerned about their safety when they use the internet.  We want you and your family to be safe while visiting our Site.  That is why, consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from any child.  We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children’s online activities.  No one under the age of 18 should submit any personal information to us without the consent of a parent or guardian.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We will post changes to this Privacy Policy and update the effective date when this Privacy Policy is updated.  The changes will take effect as soon as posted.  We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
