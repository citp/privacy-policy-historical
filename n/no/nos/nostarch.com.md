An identifiable individual is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an attribute such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. 

### You Have a Choice, Always

### How to Access and Control Your Data

We highly regard your right to access, control, correct, request deletion or request restriction of how we use your data as required by applicable law. Thus, we take necessary steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate and up to date. At all times, we will provide you with a copy of your personal information, update information when requested, inquire about the personal information we maintain on you, and will act immediately upon a request for deletion or restriction or your personal data.

When you subscribe to one of our email lists and give us permission to do so your name and email address may also be sent to and stored in another service such as Mailchimp or similar in order to send you news and advise you of special promotions. We send these out infrequently and you can unsubscribe at any time. (If you don’t see an Unsubscribe link in an email please email us at [info@nostarch.com](mailto:info@nostarch.com) and we will remove you promptly from our marketing lists.)

We use your personal information to establish and maintain your account, to provide you with certain features, and to email you regarding changes to this policy or other applicable policies.

### Disclosure of Personal Information

We will only disclose your personal information to third parties when you purchase something from our online store or when required to do so by law. When you place an order on our online store our shopping cart will pass your contact and order information to our payment processor and we will pass your contact details to our shipper if you order a physical product. 

We may disclose your personal information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) comply with the law, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (c) to protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, authors, or the public.

### Security of the Personal Information We Collect

Do not enter information at our site unless your browser indicates that the page you are using is secure by displaying a lock icon or similar in the address bar. We have implemented reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of personal information that we store and control, but no website can fully eliminate security risks. If there is a security breach of our site or a third party intercepts or accesses transmissions or private communications we will post a notice to our site.

Our site supports logins via OpenID but you should know that OpenID services may be vulnerable to DNS attacks, and use of OpenID may increase the risk of phishing. You’ll find a nice summary of the risks here: <https://sites.google.com/site/openidreview/issues>

We use Google Analytics and may use other third party analytics providers to help us collect and analyze non-personal browsing information for the same purpose. You may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Ad settings here: <https://www.google.com/settings/ads>

### No Access

We are able to log into your account on our site to review or adjust your orders, your access to eBooks, and similar, but we will not use this technical login ability for any other purpose unless required to by law.

### No Retention

### Notice

If we are required to provide a third party with your non-personal browsing information or to log in as you by law we will use reasonable means to notify you promptly of that event, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so or are otherwise advised not to by legal counsel. 

### Reorganization or Spin-Offs

We may transfer some or all of your personal and/or non-personal browsing information to a third party as a result of a reorganization, spin-off, or similar transaction. Upon such transfer, the acquirer’s privacy policy will apply. In such event, we will attempt to notify you and to ensure that at the time of the transfer the acquirer’s privacy policy is consistent with ours.
