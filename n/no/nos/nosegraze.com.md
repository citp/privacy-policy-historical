# Privacy Policy | Nose Graze Shop

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Nose Graze collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User”) of the https://www.nosegraze.com/ and https://shop.nosegraze.com/ websites (“Site”). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by Nose Graze.

## The quick version (summary)

Really you should read this whole thing, but I also know your time is valuable, so here’s a summary of the important bits:

If you sign up for my email list, of course I’ll be saving your email so I can contact you. If you make a purchase then I need to store your purchase details like billing address. Card details are not stored on my site—they are sent to a third party payment processor (SagePay / Stripe / PayPal). If you submit any forms on my site, such as comment or contact forms, then a copy is saved on my server.

Your details are only shared with relevant, trusted third parties, such as my payment processors and help desk software.

If you want to request a copy of your data or request erasure, contact support@nosegraze.com.

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Contact Forms

If you fill out a contact form on the site, the entire contents of the form along with your IP address are stored on the server as well as emailed to the site administrator. This is to ensure a copy of the form is always saved in case the email does not get delivered properly.

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.

### Newsletter

If you sign up for the newsletter, your name (if provided), email address, and IP address will be stored on the server, along with the list(s) you subscribed to and your subscription status. This is to ensure you can receive the emails you signed up for. MailGun is used for the actual email delivery, so your email address will be shared with MailGun just for the purpose of delivering the mail to you.
