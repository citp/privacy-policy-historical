      <p align="justify">At No1Reviews.com, we take your privacy seriously. We will never sell or disseminate any personal information about you or your business. Our privacy policy is outlined in full below... </p>
      <p class="style20">Information Collected</p>
      <p align="justify">No1Reviews.com will not collect any personal identifiable information from you unless you voluntarily submit such information, e.g. by signing up to our newsletter.</p>
      <p align="justify">In common with many other websites, No1Reviews.com does collect non-personally identifiable information for use in generating statistical data in order to help us market our recommended products more effectively. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style20">Our Newsletter</p>
      <p align="justify">When signing up to our newsletter/ecourse we will collect your name, e-mail address and any other preferences or personal information that you voluntarily submit to us. This information is used to send you our newsletter/ecourse and from time to time we may use this information to send you details of any special offers we may be promoting that we think you may be interested in. </p>
      <p align="justify">Our newsletters operate a double opt-in policy, meaning that in order to receive e-mails from us, you must first  enter your name and e-mail address on the subscription form on our website (usually located in the menu bar), and then you must confirm your subscription to our newsletter by clicking on a confirmation link that we send you. Only then will you be added to our mailing list. This prevents anyone else from maliciously adding your e-mail address to our mailing list. This double opt-in system is in compliance with current CAN SPAM laws and ensures that you will only receive mail from us if you yourself subscribe and confirm your subscription to our newsletter.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style20">Opt-out Policy</p>
      <p align="justify">Each and every e-mail you receive from us will have an opt-out link at the bottom, should you wish to unsubscribe from any of our newsletters. This is in compliance with current CAN SPAM laws. You can unsubscribe from our mailing lists at any time by clicking on this link. You will then be taken to another page which will ask you to confirm your wish to unsubscribe from our mailing list. If you choose to unsubscribe you will never receive any e-mails from us again. Should you choose to re-subscribe to any of our mailing lists then please subscribe again using the online form provided (usually located in the menu bar).</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style20">Use of Information</p>
      <p align="justify">Any personally identifiable information you send us (e.g. by subscribing to our newsletter, or by mailing us) will only be used by us. We will never sell, rent or otherwise disseminate your personal details to any other website, business or individuals. If you choose to unsubscribe from our mailing lists then you will never again receive notifications from us of any kind. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style20">Use of Cookies</p>
      <p align="justify">In common with many other websites, No1Reviews.com may use cookies to track your navigation around our site. These cookies are tiny text files that are placed on your hard drive and help us determine which keywords you used in the search engines that brought you to our site. Cookies, together with affiliate links, are also used to track your purchases from any of our recommended sites. The use of cookies (and the use of affiliate links) is completely harmless to you or your computer and is common practice on most websites.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style20">Third Party Sites</p>
      <p align="justify">No1Reviews.com links to many other sites as part of our effort to provide a service to our users. No1Reviews.com cannot be held responsible for the privacy policies of the other sites that we link to, and so we encourage our visitors to read these privacy policies before purchasing from or using the services offered by these third party websites.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style20">Policy Changes</p>
      <p align="justify">No1Reviews.com reserves the right to make changes to our privacy policy without notice. Users are encouraged to review this document regularly to stay informed of any policy changes. </p>
