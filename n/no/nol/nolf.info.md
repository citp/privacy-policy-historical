We may also obtain PII about you from a third party, whether in connection with some form of registration, contest, poll or otherwise. When we collect PII from you or obtain PII about you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us or a third party in order to participate in activities like contests, games, surveys, forums or some form of registration, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable sources of such information.
