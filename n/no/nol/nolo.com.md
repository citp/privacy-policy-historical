# Privacy Statement

Last Updated on 8/4/2005

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.nolo.com&sealid=101)Nolo is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. If you purchase an item directly from Nolo, or sign up to receive one or more of Nolo's email newsletters, you can be assured that we are committed to protecting your privacy. This commitment extends to all the personal information you provide when you purchase a product from our site. Nolo will not share, sell or disclose your information to third parties in any form, for any purpose, at any time unless we have your consent. This includes, but is not limited to, your email address. Information collected on this web site is available to certain business partners of Nolo who provide services to Nolo to facilitate fulfilling requested services to users. Each such business partner enters into a confidentiality agreement with Nolo. This insures that data we collect from our customers will not be sold, rented, or otherwise distributed to parties unknown to Nolo; nor used for purposes other then those expressly sanctioned by Nolo. Please note that all of our electronic mailings conform to an opt-in policy, which means you must elect to receive information from us. You will not receive unsolicited email from Nolo.

Nolo is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. This statement discloses the privacy practices for the Nolo site. When you visit a Web site displaying the [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/) trustmark, you can expect to be notified of what personally identifiable information of yours is collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. This Web site has agreed to participate in TRUSTe's formal resolution process. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us by e-mail at [privacy@nolo.com](mailto:privacy@nolo.com). If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe by clicking [here](http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from this site.

### Security

We work with LMi.net E-Commerce Solutions to make our site as secure as possible, helping you avoid e-fraud while using a top-of-the-line shopping cart system.

To protect the security of the information you give us when you order online, Nolo uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your information so that no one other than Nolo will be able to decode it. SSL establishes a secure connection between your computer and our computers, and that connection remains secure until you complete or cancel an order.

How will you know that your connection is secure? Simply check the lower right corner of your browser after placing a Nolo product in your shopping cart. If you see a closed lock or an unbroken key (depending on what browser you are using), your connection is secure and your information is safe.

### The Use of Cookies

Nolo's website places a session cookie on your computer. A cookie is a unique identifier that helps us understand how visitors navigate the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major websites employ them. Most browsers automatically accept cookies; however, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept the cookie.

The cookie itself does not identify you, your email address or any other personal information. We use the information it provides to help us improve the site and our service, and to provide our visitors with a better experience while on the site. Even without accepting a cookie you can still access most of the features on the site. There will, however, be limitations on your use of some site functions. For example, if you choose to disable cookies you will not be able to take advantage of promotional discounts in our outbound emails. In order for the links in our newsletters to work, the subsequent landing page we create for the promotion and in order have you receive the appropriate discount, your cookies will need to be enabled. The email itself does not contain a cookie, the landing page you come to via the email will use a cookie to apply the appropriate discount. There is no personal or aggregate data collected by these cookies.

### Log Files

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, and date/time stamp.
