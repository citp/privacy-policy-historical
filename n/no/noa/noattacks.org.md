Studies show that an estimated 70% of smoke from chimneys can actually reenter your home and your neighbor’s home. If you’re using a wood stove or fireplace and smell smoke in your home, it probably isn’t working as it should.  Contact a certified chimney sweep for help. **[www.epa.gov/burnwise](http://www.epa.gov/burnwise)**
