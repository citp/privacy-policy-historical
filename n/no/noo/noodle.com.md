This Privacy Policy applies to Noodle’s collection and use of personally identifiable information, which is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific person, such as a full name or email address, as well as our practices for handling non-personally identifiable information, such as user preferences and services usage information.

#### Cookies

Cookies are small bits of data that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer through your browser that enables the site or service provider to recognize your browser and remember certain information about you.

Third parties that support the Noodle Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate usage statistics, (e.g., [Google Analytics tracking](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and [Google AdWords](https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/bin/answer.py?answer=143465)) may also use these technologies to collect similar information. Noodle does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties using such technologies. Your browser may permit you to disable these technologies. However, doing so may prevent you from using certain parts of the Noodle Services.

Noodle works with many business partners who offer various products and services to consumers and other businesses, such as online courses, study abroad programs, tutoring and test preparation services. Noodle may share your Personal Information with our business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications consistent with your preferences and use of the Noodle Services and otherwise provide their services to you, and our business partners may share such information with their business partners. If you are a California resident, you have the right to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information of yours (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.

Please do not submit to us or post on the Noodle Services any personally identifiable information that you do not want us to collect. In particular, we ask that you not send us, and you not share, any sensitive information, such as social security numbers, on or through the Noodle Services. Please keep in mind that, although you are not required to provide any personally identifiable information that we request, in many cases, if you do not provide us with the requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services or respond to any questions you may have.

#### Receiving electronic communications from us

If you no longer want to receive emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in the email. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. However, we are not responsible for removing your personally identifiable information from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy or your consent.

#### Canceling your account

While your account is active, we retain your Personal Information. If you cancel your account by following the instructions set forth in the Terms of Service or if we terminate your account for any other reason, we may continue to retain your Personal Information for reasons including, but not limited to, complying with our legal obligations or our internal security policies, meeting regulatory requirements, for fraud detection, improving our site and services, or enforcing this Privacy Policy. Remember that even after your account is cancelled, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances, for example, where you have shared information with a third-party application or web site or where you have posted your Personal Information publicly on the Noodle Services. In addition, because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines. 

### SECURITY

The security of your information is very important to us. Noodle implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Information. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we take measures to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you send to us or that we store on our servers. Your use of the Noodle Services demonstrates your assumption of this risk.

### LINKED SERVICES

The Noodle Services may contain links to third-party services and sites, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. Noodle is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third-party services and sites and unaffiliated companies. Once you leave the Noodle Services or click an advertisement you will be bound by, and should review the applicable privacy policy of, the other site or service.

### SOCIAL MEDIA

The Noodle Services may contain links to our presence on various social media platforms. We do not operate or control these platforms. You should be aware that personally identifiable information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, social network or otherwise online may be viewed and used by others. We are unable to control these uses of your personally identifiable information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personally identifiable information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.

### OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION

#### Protection for Children

The Noodle Services are not targeted to children, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children younger than 13 years of age.
