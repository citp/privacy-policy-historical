Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 8/20/03

Third Sector New England (TSNE) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting [tsne.org](http://www.tsne.org/), [nonprofitquarterly.org](http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/), [diversityinitiative.org](http://www.diversityinitiative.org/) or any other domain name that TSNE owns, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

What Personal Information does TSNE Gather?

Information You Give Us

We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. For example: subscriptions to the Nonprofit Quarterly, purchasing a product such as the Executive Directors Guide, registering for a conference or submitting a form on our website. We ask for personal information so that we can fulfill your request and return your message. If you choose not to provide any of that information, we may not be able to fulfill your request or complete your order, but you will still be free to browse the other sections of our websites.

E-mail Communications

We publish the NPQ e-Newsletter on a monthly basis. The e-newsletter is distributed by email, although [back issues](http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/section/70.html) may also be viewed on our website. You may [subscribe to](http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/section/70.html) or [unsubscribe from](http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/section/282.html) the e-mail list at any time. Occasionally we send announcements about TSNE events or products to the mailing list. We do not rent our e-mail list, although we may occasionally send an announcement, event or product offering that we think may be of interest on behalf of a partner. If you wish to be excluded from these communications while remaining on the NPQ e-Newsletter list, you may send an email indicating this request to [options@lists.nonprofitquarterly.org](mailto:options@lists.nonprofitquarterly.org).

Automatic Information

When you visit any of our websites, our servers make a log of basic information corresponding to the sites and pages you have visited. This information is stored primarily to track the effectiveness of our websites and individual sections and pages within them. At this time our public websites do not **** use cookies (alphanumeric identifiers that can be stored by a visitor’s browser to identify them on a future visit, or during a single visit).

How Secure is Information About Me? 

All computers that receive or store personal information are secured by firewalls and other security measures. Additionally, sensitive data such as credit card numbers are encrypted using SSL or PGP, where possible, to provide an additional level of security. 

Conditions of Use and Revisions

If you have any concern about privacy at tsne.org or any of our websites please send us a description of your concern to [privacy@tsne.org](mailto:privacy@tsne.org) and we will try to resolve it. Changing business practices and circumstances may require that we make changes to this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this website.
