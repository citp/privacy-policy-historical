# Privacy Statement

This policy explains in detail how â€œNonstop2k.comâ€ along with its affiliated companies (hereinafter â€œweâ€, â€œusâ€, â€œourâ€, â€œNonstop2k.comâ€, â€œNonstop2kâ€) and phpBB (hereinafter â€œtheyâ€, â€œthemâ€, â€œtheirâ€, â€œphpBB softwareâ€, â€œwww.phpbb.comâ€, â€œphpBB Groupâ€, â€œphpBB Teamsâ€) use any information collected during any session of usage by you (hereinafter â€œyour informationâ€).

Your information is collected via two ways. Firstly, by browsing â€œNonstop2k.comâ€ will cause the phpBB software to create a number of cookies, which are small text files that are downloaded on to your computerâ€™s web browser temporary files. The first two cookies just contain a user identifier (hereinafter â€œuser-idâ€) and an anonymous session identifier (hereinafter â€œsession-idâ€), automatically assigned to you by the phpBB software. A third cookie will be created once you have browsed topics within â€œNonstop2k.comâ€ and is used to store which topics have been read, thereby improving your user experience.

We may also create cookies external to the phpBB software whilst browsing â€œNonstop2k.comâ€, though these are outside the scope of this document which is intended to only cover the pages created by the phpBB software. The second way in which we collect your information is by what you submit to us. This can be, and is not limited to: posting as an anonymous user (hereinafter â€œanonymous postsâ€), registering on â€œNonstop2k.comâ€ (hereinafter â€œyour accountâ€) and posts submitted by you after registration and whilst logged in (hereinafter â€œyour postsâ€).

Your account will at a bare minimum contain a uniquely identifiable name (hereinafter â€œyour user nameâ€), a personal password used for logging into your account (hereinafter â€œyour passwordâ€) and a personal, valid e-mail address (hereinafter â€œyour e-mailâ€). Your information for your account at â€œNonstop2k.comâ€ is protected by data-protection laws applicable in the country that hosts us. Any information beyond your user name, your password, and your e-mail address required by â€œNonstop2k.comâ€ during the registration process is either mandatory or optional, at the discretion of â€œNonstop2k.comâ€. In all cases, you have the option of what information in your account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated e-mails from the phpBB software.

Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure. However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of different websites. Your password is the means of accessing your account at â€œNonstop2k.comâ€, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated with â€œNonstop2k.comâ€, phpBB or another 3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the â€œI forgot my passwordâ€ feature provided by the phpBB software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and your e-mail, then the phpBB software will generate a new password to reclaim your account.

We also use third party advertisements on nonstop2k.com and all of its subdomains to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
