**_Use and Retention_**

We and others acting on our behalf may use the information that we collect or receive to operate our Website and Services, as described below:

**Operate and support our website and Services.** We use and process your personal information from your registration and usage of our Services (including your location information and your nonda Devices’ location information) to provide you with our object location services. For example, we use such information to help you track and find your nonda Devices which are in reach of your mobile device, to remember the last known location of your nonda devices, and/or to communicate to you the location of your nonda Devices in reach of other users’ mobile devices. We also use the location information of another user which has been tracked by your mobile device to help other users of the Services to find their lost nonda Device(s) by sending anonymous location updates to those other users when the nonda App on your mobile device “finds” their lost nonda Device(s).

**Other uses.** We may use and process your personal information (including your location information and your nonda Devices’ location information) to provide you with support and handle requests and complaints; to send you updates, notices, and additional information related to the Services; to create anonymous, statistical and aggregated data and reports (i.e., in a form where such data does not enable the identification of a specific user); to comply with any applicable law and assist law enforcement agencies under any applicable law, when we have a good faith belief that our cooperation with the law enforcement agencies is legally mandated or meets the applicable legal standards and procedures; and to prevent fraud, misappropriation, infringements, identity theft and other illegal activities and misuse of the Services.

**Our use and sharing of your nonda Device location information.** The Services are based on a community of all users of the Services sharing location information with us. Whenever a nonda App is activated on a user’s mobile device, we will collect detailed location information about any nonda Device(s) in reach of such mobile device, as collected and sent to us by the mobile device. Any location information we receive about nonda Device(s) located through a nonda App will be stored by us on our cloud server. Such information can be associated by us with the account for which the nonda Device(s) have been registered (by linking the unique nonda Device identifier with the account information), to help you to track your nonda Device(s) in reach of other users’ mobile devices with an activated nonda App. However, your location information will be completely anonymous to other users, unless you actively decide to share these data, e.g., by choosing to share access to your Services’ account with other people, or by using social networks. We will not identify you personally to other users or otherwise make your location information available to any third party in personal identifiable form without your prior consent.

**Your sharing of your personal information with social networks.** You may choose to share information between your Services’ account and some of your social network accounts (e.g. your Facebook account). Through this option, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you (e.g., the location of your nonda Device(s) and thus the location of your tracked items) available, transmitted and shared through the Services with your other social network account(s). By setting your Services’ account to integrate with social networks including by signing onto the Services using your social network account, you share your (personal) information between the Services and such social networks. The social network’s use of (personal) information is governed by that social network’s privacy policy and controlled by the social network, not by this Privacy Policy or us. When you connect to the social network account through the Services for the first time or otherwise make the Services interact with your social network account, you will be asked to permit the social network to share your personal information stored on such social network with the Services. We collect your information from your social network account only in accordance with the privacy settings you have set up under your social network accounts.

**Our use and sharing of aggregated information.** We use information about our users’ website activities and usage of our Services in anonymous, statistical or aggregated form, i.e., in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, to properly operate the Services, to improve the quality of the Services, to enhance your experience, to create new services and features, including customized services, to change or cancel existing content or service, and for further internal, commercial and statistical purposes. We also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected on the Services, in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information to users of the Services, or to our service providers or business partners.

**Prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraudulent or illegal activities.** We may use the information we collect to prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities; and to enforce our Privacy Notice, our Terms of Service or other policies.

**Other Contacts.** We may contact you through telephone, text, or chat for other purposes, as permitted by law. 

We retain your personal information as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations. In addition, we may retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with national laws, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our Terms of Service and take other actions permitted or required by applicable national laws. After it is no longer necessary for us to retain your personal information, we dispose of it in a secure manner according to our data retention and deletion policies.
