<p><strong></strong>Nonesuch Records ("Company," "we," "us"), a Warner Music Group company, is concerned about online privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below). This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through certain of our web sites, including the site from which you are linking to this Policy (the "Site"). This Policy does not govern our collection of information through any web site, or by any other means, other than through the Site; nor does this Policy govern the collection of information by any of our affiliates, including without limitation, Nonesuch Records, Warner Music Group, and Warner Bros. Records (collectively, "Affiliated Entities") or by third parties.</p>
<p> By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change this Policy without prior notice. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the "Last Updated" legend at the top of this page. Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect.</p>
<p> The Site is controlled and operated by Company from the United States, and is not intended to subject Company or any Affiliated Entity to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. Company does not represent or warrant that the Site, or any part thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. You are also subject to United States export controls in connection with your use of the Site and/or Site-related services, and are responsible for any violations of such controls, including without limitation any United States embargoes or other federal rules and regulations restricting exports. We may limit the Site's availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion. By using the Site and submitting any Personally Identifiable Information, visitors from outside of the United States acknowledge that the Site is subject to United States law and consent to the transfer of Personally Identifiable Information to the United States, which may provide a different level of data security than in their country of residence, and waive any claims that may arise under their own national laws.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Note Regarding the Use of the Site by Children: </strong>The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide Personally Identifiable Information through the Site. </p>
<p></p>
<ol class="number-list">
<li>
<p><strong>What 	Types of Information Does Company Collect From Me? </strong> 	</p>
<p></p>
<p>Company gathers two basic types of information through the Site: "Personally Identifiable Information" (or "PII") and "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" (or "Non-PII"). Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual; that is, your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other payment account number. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="alpha-list">
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Personally 		Identifiable Information. </strong></strong>You 		do not have to provide PII to use the Site. However, in order for 		you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through 		the Site (for example, to sign up for a newsletter or to view 		certain areas of the Site), we may require that you furnish PII. 		We collect PII from you through the Site only when you voluntarily 		provide it to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a name="OLE_LINK1" title="OLE_LINK1"></a><strong>Non-Personally 		Identifiable Information. </strong></strong>When 		you visit and interact with the Site, Company and third parties 		with whom Company has contracted to provide services to Company may 		collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you 		visit). Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from five 		different sources: server log files, environmental variables, 		cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies and information 		that you voluntarily provide.<strong> 		</strong></p>
<ol class="roman-list">
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Server 	Log Files. </strong></strong>Your 	Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically 	assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service 	Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically 	in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the 	time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use 	your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes 	such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems 	with the Site's servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP 	addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done 	automatically by many web sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Environmental 			Variables.</strong> 			 </strong>We and our service providers may also collect certain 			environmental variables, such as your MAC address, computer type 			(Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet 			browser, and Internet browser version. These environmental 			variables are collected by most browsers, and can be used to 			optimize your experience on the Site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Cookies. 			 </strong></strong>We 			and our service providers may use "cookies" on the Site. 			Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's 			computer for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are an industry 			standard used by most web sites, and can facilitate users' ongoing 			access to and use of a particular web site; cookies do not cause 			damage to your computer systems or files. If you do not want 			information collected through the use of cookies, there is a 			simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically 			decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or 			accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a 			particular web site, to your computer.<strong> 			</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Pixel 			Tags. </strong></strong>We 			and our service providers may also use so-called "pixel 			tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or 			similar means (collectively, "Pixel 			Tags") 			in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail 			messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics 			about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic 			image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible 			to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on the 			visitors' hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who 			have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded 			services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional 			or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail 			messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the 			e-mail has been opened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Information 			That You Voluntarily Provide.</strong> 			 </strong>Company also collects Non-PII (<em>e.g.</em>, 			your interests, your geographic location, etc.) when you 			voluntarily provide such information to us. When such information 			is not combined with any PII, such information is considered to be 			Non-PII, as it does not personally identify you or any other user. 			 Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the 			end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of 			the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of 			our users who like a particular artist. Such aggregate 			information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> 	<strong>How Does Company Use 	Information Collected From Me? </strong> 	</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol class="alpha-list">
<li>
<p><strong> 		<strong>Personally 		Identifiable Information. </strong></strong>We 		may use PII about you in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Fulfillment 	of Requests. </strong></strong>Company 	may use PII about you to fulfill 	the purpose for which such PII was provided 	(<em>e.g.</em>, 	to send newsletters to you or fulfill your purchase).<strong> 	</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Administrative 	Communications. </strong></strong> 	From time 	to time, in our sole discretion, we may use PII about you to send to you 	important information regarding the Site, or changes to our terms, 	conditions, and policies. Because this information may be important 	to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such 	communications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Other 	Communications. </strong></strong>If 	you affirmatively opt-in to receive marketing messages from Company and the Affiliated Entities, Company and the Affiliated Entities 	may use PII about you to inform you of products, 	programs, 	services and promotions that 	we believe may be of interest to you. If you would prefer not to 	receive marketing-related e-mail 	messages, 	please refer to Section 3.e ("<em>Opt-Out</em>") 	below.<strong> 	</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Third 	Party Communications.</strong> 	 </strong>If you affirmatively opt-in to Company sharing PII about you with third parties for their marketing purposes, we 	may share PII about you with third parties to allow them to contact you 	regarding products, 	programs, 	services and promotions that they believe may be of interest to you. 	 If you would like to later opt-out of receiving marketing-related 	e-mail 	messages from such third parties, please utilize any opt-out 	mechanisms set forth in such third parties' marketing-related 	e-mail 	messages and/or privacy policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a name="OLE_LINK2" title="OLE_LINK2"></a><strong>Disclosures 	to Artists.</strong> 	 </strong>One of the reasons we operate the Site is to provide you with news 	and information about Warner 	Bros. Records and 	our artists. 	 As such, if you affirmatively opt-in to Company sharing PII about you with our artists, we may share PII about you with 	such 	artists 	and their representatives (collectively, "Artist(s)") 	so that such Artists have information on users of the Site, and such 	Artists may use this information to contact you regarding products, 	programs, services and promotions that such Artists believe may be 	of interest to you. Although we seek to have Artists agree to abide 	by this Policy, we do not control, and are not responsible for, 	Artists' use of PII about you. If you would prefer not to receive 	marketing-related e-mail messages from Artist(s), please see the 	"<em>Opt-Out</em>" 	section below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Purchases. 	 </strong></strong>When 	you make a purchase through the Site, we may collect your credit 	card number or other payment account number (for example, your 	wireless account number), billing address and other information 	related to such purchase (collectively, "Payment 	Information") 	from you, and may use such Payment Information in order to fulfill 	your purchase. We may also provide such Payment Information, or 	other PII provided by you, to third parties as necessary to complete 	your purchase (for example, to process your credit card or payment 	account number). To the extent that Payment Information includes 	Non-PII, use of such Non-PII is governed by Section 2.b below.<strong> 	 	</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>E-mails 	to Friends. </strong></strong>We 	may provide functionality to permit you to send messages regarding 	Site-related content (such as music clips or artist information) to 	a friend through the Site. If you wish to use this feature, you may 	provide us with your friend's e-mail address so that we can 	facilitate your sending of such message to your friend. To do so, 	any PII you provide in connection with sending your friend such 	message, such as your name and your e-mail address, will, of course, 	be disclosed to your friend.<strong> 	</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Promotions. 	 </strong></strong>Company, 	Artist(s) or the Affiliated Entities may operate sweepstakes, 	contests and other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") 	through the Site. We typically ask you for certain PII when you 	enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. We reserve the right to 	share this PII with third parties sponsors of such Promotions 	(irrespective of whether such Promotions are hosted by us), or 	otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such Promotion. 	 You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in 	which you participate through the Site, as they may contain 	additional important information about Company's, a sponsor's or 	other third parties' use of PII about you. To the extent that the 	terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of PII about you conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such 	rules shall control.<strong> 	</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Internal 	Business Purposes.</strong> 	 </strong>We may also use PII about you for our internal business purposes, such 	as data analysis, audits and so forth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Third 	Party Service Providers. </strong></strong>We 	work with third parties who provide services including but not 	limited to data analysis, order fulfillment and other services of an 	administrative nature. We reserve the right to share PII about you with 	such third parties for the purpose of enabling these third parties 	to provide such services (for example, if you choose to buy wireless 	products or services from us, we may share your personally 	identifiable information with your wireless carrier and our third 	party service providers so that such products and/or services can be 	delivered to you and/or your mobile device).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Assignment. 	 </strong></strong>We 	reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we 	collect from Site users to an Affiliated Entity or a third party in 	the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, 	assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of 	Company's business, assets or stock (including without limitation in 	connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). 	Additionally, 	please note that if any Artist is no longer affiliated with Company, 	we may transfer or provide a copy of any and all information that we 	collect from Site users to such Artist.<strong> 	</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Law 	enforcement; emergencies; compliance.</strong> 	 </strong>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, 	we reserve the right to disclose PII about you to others as we believe to 	be appropriate (a) under applicable law; (b) to comply with legal 	process (c) to respond to governmental requests; (d) to enforce our 	Terms and Conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of 	any Affiliated Entities or our artists; (f) to protect the rights, 	privacy, safety or property of Company, the Affiliated Entities, our 	artists, you or others; and (g) to permit us to pursue available 	remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. For example, we 	may, to the fullest extent the law allows, disclose PII about you to 	law enforcement agencies to assist them in identifying individuals 	who have been or may be engaged in unlawful activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Non-Personally 		Identifiable Information. </strong></strong>Because 		Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such 		information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to 		share such Non PII, which does not personally identify you, 		with Affiliated Entities and other third parties, for any purpose.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as combining your name with your geographic location). If we do combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII hereunder as long as it is so combined (see Section 2.a above).<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong> 	<strong>Other Important 	Notices Regarding Our Privacy Practices.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol class="alpha-list">
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Profiles.</strong> 	 </strong>We may provide functionality on the Site that allows you to create 	a "profile page" (your "Profile") 	and post certain information and materials on your Profile. Please 	note that your Profile, including all PII available in your Profile, 	may be accessible to other users. We urge you to exercise 	discretion and caution when deciding to disclose PII about you, or any 	other information, in your Profile. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 	USE BY OTHERS OF ANY PII YOU DISCLOSE IN YOUR PROFILE.<strong> 	</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><strong>Information 	Posted by Visitors. </strong></strong>Company 	may make available through the Site services (for example, message 	boards, chat functionality and blogs, among other services) to which 	you are able to post information and materials. Please note that 	any information you disclose through such services or otherwise on 	the Site becomes public information, and may be available to 	visitors to the Site and to the general public. In addition, when 	you choose to make a posting on such services, certain PII (for 	example, a link to your Profile that contains PII), will be 	available for other users to view. We urge you to exercise 	discretion and caution when deciding to disclose PII about you, or any 	other information, on the Site.

Security measures and tools, such 	as firewalls, are in place to help protect against the loss, misuse 	and alteration of the information under our control. Unfortunately, 	no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be 	guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to 	protect PII about you, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any 	information you transmit to us through or in connection with the 	Site or 	that is stored by us. We 	also seek to strike a balance between the security of your data and 	your convenience. We do this because we believe that our customers 	attach value to both. As a result, we will often use a method of 	communication that is less secure than other, less convenient 	alternatives. For example, certain data you send us, including PII, 	may be sent to us in unencrypted form. You 	acknowledge and agree that any information you transmit through the 	Site is so transmitted at your own risk. If 	you are concerned that PII about you may be transmitted over the Internet 	in unencrypted form, please do not provide us with any PII. 	 If 	you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no 	longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any 	account you might have with us has been compromised), you must 	immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance 	with Section 3.f (<em>"Contacting 	Us,")</em> 	below (note that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this 	will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).<strong> 	</strong></p>

<p><strong><strong>Opt-Out. 	 </strong></strong>If 	you would prefer not to receive marketing-related 	e-mail 	messages from Company or any particular Affiliated Entity, you 	may opt-out of receiving such messages by following the 	"unsubscribe" instructions in the latest such message you have 	received from 	Company or such Affiliated Entity, respectively. 	 Please note that following such "unsubscribe" instructions will 	opt you out of receiving marketing-related e-mail 	messages 	from the sender of the particular message from which you initiated 	the opt-out process, but will not opt you out of receiving such 	messages from other senders (including, as applicable, Company, 	Artist(s) or other Affiliated Entities).</p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong></p>
<p> Additionally, if you would like to opt-out of receiving marketing-related e-mail messages from Artist(s) or other third parties with whom we have shared PII about you hereunder, please utilize any opt-out mechanisms set forth in such third parties' or Artist(s) marketing-related e-mail messages and/or privacy policies, if any.</p>
