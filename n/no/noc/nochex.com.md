## Required Information

To open an account you must tell us certain personal information such as your name, email address, date of birth and postal address.

For security, you must also submit a password and answer security questions. 

For some transactions you need to provide financial data such as your debit card details. We only collect data required by regulation and law for us to process your transactions securely and protect you from fraud.
