# Privacy Policy | Clinton Foundation

##### Effective: 04/29/16

The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation (the “Foundation”) Privacy Policy (“Policy”) was created to help you understand how the Foundation collects and uses information that is collected online through the Foundation’s websites: clintonfoundation.org, clintonglobalinitiative.org, clintonpresidentialcenter.org, noceilings.org, dineatfortytwo.com and clintonmuseumstore.com (each, a “Site”) or that you submit to the Foundation when making a donation. The Foundation is committed to protecting your privacy. By using this Site, you agree to be legally bound by this Policy and the [Terms of Use](https://www.clintonfoundation.org/terms-use), as they may be amended from time to time. If you do not agree to this Policy or cannot form a legally binding contract, you are not permitted to use this Site.

This Policy may also cover information collected and used by the Foundation via third party social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.

##### Information Collected

We aggregate and analyze this usage information and use it for operational and administrative purposes, including to identify levels and area of interest in our website, and to improve and refine the Site. We may also share this aggregated, anonymous data with our business partners on an as-needed basis.

 **Personal Information**

The Foundation also collects information that may identify you (“Personal Information”) that you provide when making a donation to the Foundation (whether online, by mail or other physical means) or participating in any activity on a Site that requires your voluntarily submitted information, including completing any of our Site’s forms, for example, donation forms, registration forms, contact forms, online surveys, merchandise transactions, and position applications, such as:
