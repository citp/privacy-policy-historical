We do collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail and those who indicate their e-mail address when placing an order or joining our mailing list. We also collect aggregate information on what pages visitors access and information volunteered by visitors, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

We use the information we collect to more effectively communicate with our users and website visitors and for marketing purposes. At times we also share the information with other reputable organizations for marketing purposes.

At times we also share the information with other reputable organizations so that they may offer products or services that we believe will be attractive to those people who have either purchased Nova products or who have elected to subscribe to our mailing list.

With respect to Cookies: We use cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record session information, such as the country in which they live (for purposes of calculating shipping costs, for example) and the items they add to their shopping carts.

With respect to Ad Servers: We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.

We do not provide site visitors with access to information that we have collected and that we maintain about them. However, consumers can have this type of information corrected by calling or writing us at our corporate office at:
