**Information we collect when you register and how we use it**  
Novatech are seriously commited to the privacy and security of your personal information. When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, delivery address, the credit or debit card number, card's expiry date and the card's registered address. This allows us to process your orders and to notify you of the status of your order. We also ask for your telephone number so that we can contact you if there is a problem with your order. If there is a delivery problem we sometimes give the number to our carriers so they can contact you to arrange delivery. 

When you enter a Novatech competition, we may ask you for your name, address and e-mail address so that we can administer the competition and notify winners. Whilst we may post the name and town of any winners on our site, we would never divulge any of their other details. 

We may also use the information we collect to send you our monthly catalogue and e-mail you special offers, changes to the website and other valuable information. If you would rather not recieve our catalogue please call our main telephone number or uncheck the 'catalogue' box in your User Profile. If you do not wish to receive our e-mail promotions please uncheck the 'E-Weekly E-mails' box in your My Personal Details page when logged in, or use the unsubscribe link on any marketing e-mail you receive. 

**Will Novatech disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**  
We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. We may choose to do so in the future with reputable third parties, but you can tell us not to by sending a blank e-mail message to [nocontact@novatech.co.uk](mailto:nocontact@novatech.co.uk). (If you use more than one email address to shop with us, send this message from each e-mail account you use.) Novatech may also provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

**How do we protect customer information?**  
Novatech use many different industry standard security techniques to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. When you place orders or access your account information, you are connected to our secure server. We encrypt your information using SSL (secure socket layers) secure server software before it is sent to us. This ensures that your information can only be read by our secure server and cannot be unscrambled by any outside party. 

Your information is then stored on another secure server, which is not directly connected to the Internet. Furthermore, all information is collected lawfully and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1988, registration no: PZ6599797. None of the thousands of customers who have purchased from Novatech have reported fraudulent use of their debit or credit cards as a result of purchasing from our website.
