    * affiliate networks through whom you have accessed our website;


  * to any third party to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
  * to protect our customers and website from fraud and theft, we may share personal data that is required to make identity checks and personal data that we obtain from making identity checks (including data relating to name and location), together with account information, with organisations (including law enforcement agencies), involved in fraud prevention and detection and credit risk reduction.

**Marketing Preferences**

We may send you marketing communications and promotional offers:

  * by email if you have signed up for email newsletters;
  * if you have provided us with your details when you entered a competition and you have consented to receive such marketing

We will ask you for your preferences in relation to receiving marketing communications by email, post, telephone, SMS and other communication channels.

From time to time we may also include with your order, inserts advertising goods, services or offers from other third-party companies that you may be interested in.

You will always have full control of your marketing preferences. If you do not wish to continue receiving marketing information from us (or any third party, if applicable) at any time:

  * account holders may withdraw their consent by simply logging in to [My Account](http://www.boohoo.com/myaccount) and editing your ‘Contact Preferences’.



We will process all opt-out requests as soon as possible, but please note that due to the nature of our IT systems and servers it may take a few days for any opt-out request to be implemented. 

**Online advertisements**

We use online advertising to keep you aware of what we’re up to and to help you find our products. 

Like many companies, we may target Novatech banners and ads to you when you use other websites and apps, based on your Contact, Technical and Marketing data. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and a range of advertising technologies such as web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers, as well as specific services offered by some sites and social networks, such as Facebook’s Custom Audience Service.

**Our use of analytics and targeted advertising tools**

We use a range of analytics and targeted advertising tools to display relevant website content on our website and online advertisements on other websites and apps (as described above) to you, deliver relevant content to you in marketing communications (where applicable), and to measure the effectiveness of the advertising provided. For example, we use tools such as Google Analytics to analyse Google's interest-based advertising data and/or third-party audience data (such as age, marital status, life event, gender and interests) to target and improve our marketing campaigns, marketing strategies and website content. We may also use tools provided by other third parties, such as Facebook and Bing to perform similar tasks, using your contact, purchase and technical data.

If you would like any further information about the data collected by these third parties or the way in which the data is used, please contact us.

**  
Cookies**

Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website and to keep track of your visits. They help us to provide you with the very best experience when you browse our website and to make improvements to our website. They also help us and our advertising networks to make advertising relevant to you and your interests. 

You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that our website will not function properly.

For detailed information on the cookies which we and our third-party providers use and the reasons why we use them, please refer to our Cookie Policy

### Cookies for Site Performance and Site Analytics.

#### Cookies Policy

We use a session cookie to remember your log-in details for you. We deem this strictly necessary to the working of this website and if these are disabled then various functionality of the site will be broken and you will be unable to place any orders.

#### Persistent Cookies. 

We use persistent cookies to remember items you have placed in your shopping basket and items you have recently viewed. Again, we deem these strictly necessary for the working of the site and if these are disabled you would be unable to place an order.

#### Affiliates and the Partner Program.

The affiliate schemes and partner program that we run requires cookies to record the fact that you have either come to our site through an affiliate or are a member of our partner program. Without this tracking we would be unable to record who placed orders through affiliate schemes or the partner program and we would be unable to pay commission or record partner points. As such these are also deemed necessary to the working of the site and if disabled would break this functionality.

#### Google Analytics.

We use this to understand how the site is being used in order to improve the user experience. User data is all anonymous. You can find out more about Google’s position on privacy as regards its analytics service at <https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html>

#### Social Buttons.

On many of the pages of the site you will see 'social buttons'. These enable users to share or bookmark certain pages. There are buttons for: Twitter, Google +1, Facebook ‘Like’ and HotUKDeals. In order to implement these buttons, and connect them to the relevant social networks and external sites, there are scripts from domains outside of Novatech. You should be aware that these sites are likely to be collecting information about what you are doing all around the internet, including on Novatech’s site. So if you click on any of these buttons, these sites will be registering that action and may use that information. In some cases these sites will be registering the fact that you are visiting Novatech, and the specific pages you are on, even if you don’t click on the button if you are logged into their services, like Google and Facebook. You should check the respective policies of each of these sites to see how exactly they use your information and to find out how to opt out, or delete, such information.

#### External Web Services.

We may occasionally use a number of external web services on the Novatech site, mostly to display content within our web pages. For example, to display videos we use YouTube. This is not an exhaustive or complete list of the services we use, or might use in the future, when embedding content, but are the most common. As with the social buttons we cannot prevent these sites, or external domains, from collecting information on your usage of this embedded content. If you are not logged in to these external services then they will not know who you are but are likely to gather anonymous usage information e.g. number of views, plays, loads etc.

#### Email Tracking.

Some emails that we send you have in tracking so that we can tell how much traffic those emails send to our site. We use this information to understand open and click rates on our emails to try and improve them. You can opt out of receiving these emails, should you wish to, via the "My Personal Details" page when logged in.

#### Blog Comments & Reviews.

In order to leave a comment on our Blog or review a product you have to give us your Name and Email address. We require name and email addresses for quality control purposes.

#### Safe Shopping Guarantee

As a security guarantee, Novatech will cover the first £50 of any fraudulent use of your credit or debit card that results through no fault of your own from purchases made on the Novatech website. Your card company should limit any liability to yourself to £50 maximum.

**

Our website may include links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates, or to social media platforms. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to their websites.

****Data Retention**

Novatech must comply with a number of statutory and regulatory requirements in relation to the retention of data. Your personal data must be retained for a period of no less than six years following the closure of your account with us, or six years from the date of the last transaction, whichever is the latter. We do not sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for marketing purposes.

We will periodically review your personal information to ensure that we do not keep it for longer than is permitted by law.
