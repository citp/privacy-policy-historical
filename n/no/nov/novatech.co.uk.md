When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, delivery address, the credit or debit card number, card's expiry date and the card's registered address. This allows us to process your orders and to notify you of the status of your order.  
|  |

When you enter a Novatech competition, we may ask you for your name, address and e-mail address so that we can administer the competition and notify winners. Whilst we may post the name and town of any winners on our site, we would never divulge any of their other details.  
  
We may also use the information we collect to send you our monthly catalogue and e-mail you special offers, changes to the website and other valuable information.
