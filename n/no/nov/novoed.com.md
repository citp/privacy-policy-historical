Cookies are small text files that are downloaded by the browser that you use to reach and use our service. These cookies collect, store, and share data of your activities across websites. They are mainly used to learn about your actions when you interact with the sites and services and “remember” you and your preferences, such as your preferred browser or language, either for a single visit (via a ‘session cookie’) or for multiple visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).

We use both session-based and persistent cookies. Here’s what they are:

  * Session cookies are temporary and last only while your browser is open. They are deleted from your device when you leave the service.
  * Persistent cookies remain in your browser or device for a much longer time mostly until your browser deletes them or when they reach their expiry date, depending on the cookie. They are unique and allow us to perform site analytics and customization, among other similar things.



Cookies may be set by either the site that you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or by third parties, such as those who use our services (‘third party cookies’). More information on cookies can be found at [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

The table below explains the types of cookies we use on our websites and why we use them.

**Necessary** | These cookies are strictly necessary to perform important activities such as allowing registered users to authenticate themselves to secure areas and perform account related functions.  
**Preference**    | These cookies allow our services to recognize you and remember your preferences when using our services. This enables us to personalize our content for you and provide you with a more personal experience without you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Services.

Likewise, we may also use cookies to restrict you from accessing certain content or features, protect our sites and services, and to carry out the requests that you make. 

NovoEd uses third-party applications to provide better service to all our users. These apps and services make use of persistent cookies to improve user experience, analyze user behavior, and manage content.  

You have the right to decide whether or not to accept cookies and similar technologies. If, however, you choose to disable cookies, it may affect the availability and functionality of some components or features of NovoEd.

Most browsers accept cookies, by default. However, they provide ways that allow you to change cookie settings in order to make the browser refuse certain types of cookies or at least inform you before accepting cookies. You can make these changes either through the browser’s inbuilt settings or through external plugins. The procedure for changing cookie settings is different for different browsers. You can go to the help page of your browser to learn more.
