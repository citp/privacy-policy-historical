				<h2>Novell Online Privacy Policy<br>Effective on: 11 Aug 2004</h2>

				<p><a href="https://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.novell.com" target="_blank"><img src="/company/policies/privacy/img/clickseal.gif" align="left" height="73" width="91" border="0" alt="TRUSTe: Click to Verify"></a></p>

				<p>We at Novell value the relationship we have with our customers and web site visitors, and are committed to responsible information handling practices.  We take the privacy of our customers very seriously and want you to feel comfortable whenever you visit our web sites, access our online services, or participate in our online offerings.  Although our web sites have unique services and offerings, they share a similar privacy philosophy. Therefore, we drafted this corporate online privacy policy to represent Novell's general privacy approach to the information practices of our web sites. In addition to this privacy policy, you can find specific web site privacy statements that provide more detailed information about the web site data handling practices-see links below:</p>

				<h3>Novell privacy principles</h3>
					
				<p>Our approach to responsible information handling is founded on the basis of the Fair Information Practices, the cornerstone of which is providing notice of our information practices and other privacy aspects in order to allow individuals to make informed decisions regarding personally identifiable information.
