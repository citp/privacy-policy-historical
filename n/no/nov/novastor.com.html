                          <p style="padding-left:10px">NovaStor is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement applies to data collected by NovaStor through its websites and product registration forms. </p>
                          <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px">Collection of Your Personal Information</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;">In order to access services provided by NovaStor, you will be asked to sign in with an email address and a password. We define this data as your NovaStor credentials.
                            
                            At some NovaStor sites, we ask you to provide additional personal information, such as your name, home or work address, or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, and interests. If you choose to make a purchase, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address, which is used to create a NovaStor billing account.
                            We may collect further information about your interaction with NovaStor sites, including information about the pages you viewed, hyperlinks used as well as other actions related to your visit of our website. Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring website addresses.</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> In order to evaluate this information, we may send it to Omniture, a service that analyzes websites. On behalf of NovaStor, Omniture SiteCatalyst uses cookies to examine your interaction with NovaStor websites. </p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;">When you receive newsletters or promotional email from NovaStor, we may use web beacons, customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications or other information.</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with NovaStor, information collected through one NovaStor service may be combined with information obtained through other NovaStor services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.
                            
                            When you download or order products on NovaStor websites, we may use web beacons provided by affiliate networks.</p>
                          <p style="padding-left:10px">Use of Your Personal Information</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> NovaStor collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and services. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;">We may also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. We may send regular newsletters that we view as part of our customer service. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from NovaStor and its affiliates. </p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;">Personal information collected on NovaStor sites and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which NovaStor or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. By using our web site or a NovaStor service, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to any country in which NovaStor or its affiliates, subsidiaries or distribution partners maintain facilities.</p>
                          <p style="padding-left:10px">Sharing of Your Personal Information</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of NovaStor and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent.</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;">We reserve the right to provide your personal information to NovaStor distribution partners solely in order to allow them to offer advice and/or sell NovaStor products and services. Our distribution partners are prohibited from using your personal information unless the use is directly related to NovaStor.</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> We may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of NovaStor or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of NovaStor employees, customers or the public.</p>
                          <p style="padding-left:10px">Accessing Your Personal Information</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;">You may have the ability to view or edit your personal information online. In order to help prevent your personal information from being viewed by others, you will be required to sign in with your NovaStor credentials (email address and password). The appropriate method(s) for accessing your personal information will depend on which sites or services you have used. </p>
                          <p style="padding-left:10px">Communication Preferences</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> You can stop the delivery of future promotional email from NovaStor sites and services by following the specific instructions in the email you receive.</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> You may also have the option of proactively making choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail from particular NovaStor sites or services by visiting and signing into the respective pages.
                            
                            These choices do not apply to the receipt of mandatory service communications that are considered part of certain NovaStor services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the service.</p>
                          <p style="padding-left:10px">Security of Your Personal Information</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> NovaStor is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
                            
                            If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users. Also, we recommend that you do not save your password in a so-called password manager.</p>
                          <p style="padding-left:10px">Use of Cookies</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> NovaStor websites use "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> One of the primary purposes of cookies is to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized content on your later visits to these sites. </p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;">You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use interactive features of NovaStor sites and services that depend on cookies.</p>
                          <p style="padding-left:10px">Use of Web Beacons</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> NovaStor websites may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages.
                            
                            We may include web beacons in promotional email messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
                            
                            NovaStor may also employ web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of our sites. We prohibit web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information.</p>
                          <p style="padding-left:10px">Use of Omniture SiteCatalyst</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> The NovaStor websites listed below use Omniture SiteCatalyst, a service provided by Omniture Inc. („Omniture") that analyzes websites.

                          <p style="padding-left:10px">Controlling Unsolicited Email ("Spam")</p>
                          <p style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left:10px; text-align: justify;"> NovaStor is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial email, or "spam." NovaStor will not sell, lease or rent its email subscriber lists to third parties. While NovaStor continues to actively review and implement new technology, such as expanded filtering features, there is no currently available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited email. Using junk email tools and being cautious about the sharing of your email address while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited email you receive.</p>
