<p>4.1 We may hold a variety of personal information about you, including your name, date of birth, your current and previous addresses, your phone number, e-mail address, and certain details about your personal interests.</p>

<p>4.3 If you choose not to give personal information to us, we may not be able to provide you with access to some or all of the web sites or to our other products and services.</p>
<p><strong>5 How we collect personal information</strong></p>
<p>5.1 We may collect personal information from you in a number of ways, including:</p>
<ul>

<p>6.1 We may also collect personal information about you when you use and access our web sites.</p>
<p>6.2 One of the ways we may collect information about you is through the use of “cookie”. A cookie is a small text file that the web site may place on your computer.

<p>6.3 You can adjust your Internet browser to disable cookies or to warn you when cookies are being used. However, if you disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas of our web sites or take advantage of the improved web site experience that cookies offer.</p>
<p>6.4 When you visit our web sites, our web servers may record other information about or relating to you, such as the time and date of your visit or the IP address assigned to the computer you are using to access the web site. In many cases, we cannot and do not use this information to identify you personally - rather, we simply use this information to track and improve the performance of the web sites.</p>
<p><strong>7 How we use your personal information</strong></p>

<p><strong>8 When we disclose your personal information</strong></p>
<p>8.1 We may disclose your personal information to each other, to our related companies and to various outside organisations (some of which may be located in foreign countries). &nbsp;Except as permitted under the National Privacy Principles, we will only disclose your personal information for one of the purposes set out in part 7.1 above.</p>
<p>8.2 Some of the outside organisations we may disclose your personal information to include:</p>

</ul>
<p>8.3 If any of these organisations are located outside Australia, you expressly consent to us disclosing your personal information to those organisations.</p>
<p>8.4 We take reasonable steps to ensure that each organisation that we disclose your personal information to is committed to protecting your privacy.</p>
<p>8.5 When you register as a member of any of our web sites, some information about your account (such as your user name) may be publicly available on our web sites when you contribute content to our web sites, or participate in any of our web site forums or chat rooms.&nbsp; If you choose to include any personal information about yourself in any content that you contribute to any of our web sites, that information will be available and accessible to other users of our web sites anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>8.6 You must not include any personal information about other people in any content that you contribute to any of our web sites, unless such people have expressly consented to you including their personal information in such content and to you providing the content to us for use on our web sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9 Help us to ensure we hold accurate information</strong></p>
<p>9.1 We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date. &nbsp;However, the accuracy of the information we hold depends to a large extent on the information you provide.</p>
<p>9.2 Please help us by:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; letting us know if there are any errors in the information we hold about you; and</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; keeping us up to date with changes to your information, such as changes to your name or address.</p>

<p>12.1 Our web sites may contain links to other Internet web sites. &nbsp;These links are provided solely for your convenience.</p>
<p>12.2 If you submit personal information to or via any linked site, the privacy principles applying to that information will be outside our control. &nbsp;You should therefore check the privacy statement of the linked site before submitting information to or via that site.</p>
