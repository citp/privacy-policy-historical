NOVAGRAAF processes personal data in order to comply with its legal obligations. Those legal obligations are defined in national and/or international law and in national rules issued by the competent national supervisory authorities and can include maintaining records, compliance checks, or screening and recording for tax, social, or security objectives.



## 3\. Sharing of personal data

As a global law firm, NOVAGRAAF may share the personal data it collects via its website internally with its offices in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States.

NOVAGRAAF may employ the services of third parties to support us with certain tasks, such as internet technical support or marketing automation. In order to do so, we may also share your data with our third-party service providers, so that they can perform services on our behalf.

NOVAGRAAF uses service providers (e.g. translators, designers, website developers, etc.) who may also need to process the personal data strictly necessary to carry out the services we ask of them (assignment, electronic and postal dissemination, logistics, etc.).

NOVAGRAAF does not sell, lease, share, or otherwise transfer your personal data to third parties.

## 4\. Keeping your personal data secure

NOVAGRAAF takes care to protect and secure your personal data in order to ensure that they are kept confidential, and to prevent them from being distorted, damaged, destroyed or disclosed to unauthorised third parties.

Under the applicable European rules, in the event that a personal data breach is found which is capable of causing a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, NOVAGRAAF will notify that breach to the competent national supervisory authority and, where required by the European rules, to the data subjects (individually or collectively depending on the circumstances).

NOVAGRAAF keeps your personal data for the time necessary to perform the agreed purposes, subject to its legal rights to archive some data, its obligations to keep certain data and/or to the fact that it can anonymise data.

In addition, the firm's website may offer links to third-party websites which may be of interest to you. NOVAGRAAF has no control over the contents of those third-party websites or what those third parties do with any personal data they may gather. NOVAGRAAF therefore cannot be held liable for the processing of your personal data by those third parties, which is not subject to the privacy statement. You are responsible for finding out about those third parties' data protection policies.

## 5\. Your rights

Under Regulation (EU) No 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, from the time it comes into force on 25 May 2018, you will have rights of access, amendment, opposition and erasure over information about you, and the right to know and receive that information. You can exercise your rights by emailing [info@novagraaf.com](mailto:info@novagraaf.com) or writing to

Novagraaf Nederland B.V.  
PO Box 22722 1100 DE AMSTERDAM

**specifying in the subject line of the email or letter "Personal rights"** and enclosing a copy of your identity document. You can also object to your data being processed and to your data being used for marketing purposes.

NOVAGRAAF undertakes to respond as soon as possible, and in any event within one month from receiving your request.

When necessary, that period may be extended by two months, having regard for the number and complexity of requests sent to NOVAGRAAF. Where that occurs, you will be informed of that extension and the reasons for it.

If NOVAGRAAF does not act on your request, it will inform you of the reasons for doing nothing and you will be entitled to make a complaint to a supervisory authority and/or to bring court proceedings.

  * _**Right to information about the processing of your personal data**_



NOVAGRAAF endeavours to provide you with concise, comprehensible and easily accessible information in clear and simple terms about how your personal data are processed.

  * _**Right of access, rectification and erasure of your personal data**_



The right of access enables you to obtain confirmation from NOVAGRAAF that your personal data are or are not processed, and where they are, to access them or obtain a copy of them.

You are also entitled to have NOVAGRAAF rectify your personal data, within 30 days.

Lastly, subject to the exceptions under the applicable law (e.g. retention of data necessary to comply with a legal obligation), you are entitled to request NOVAGRAAF to erase your personal data as soon as possible, where one of the following grounds applies:

  * Your personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;
  * You wish to withdraw your consent where that consent was the basis for processing your personal data when there is no other basis justifying that processing;
  * You believe and are able to show that your personal data have been processed unlawfully;
  * Your personal data must be erased pursuant to a legal obligation.


  * _**Right to personal data portability**_



Where processing is based on your consent or on a contract, the portability right enables you to receive the personal data you have provided to NOVAGRAAF in a structured, commonly used format and to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from NOVAGRAAF.

Where it is technically possible to do so, you can request that those personal data be transmitted directly by NOVAGRAAF to another data controller.

  * _**Right to withdraw consent to the processing of personal data**_



Where NOVAGRAAF processes your personal data on the basis of your consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time using the means made available to you for that purpose. Under the applicable law, however, withdrawing your consent is not retrospective and cannot therefore affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal.

  * _**Right to make a complaint to a supervisory authority**_



_**​​​​​​​**_ If, notwithstanding NOVAGRAAF's efforts to keep your personal data confidential, you believe that your rights have not been complied with, you have a right to make a complaint to a supervisory authority. You can find a list of supervisory authorities on [the European Commission's website](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/index_en.htm).
