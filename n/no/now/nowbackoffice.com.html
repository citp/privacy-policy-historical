        <h2>Privacy Statement</h2>

        <p>Your privacy is very important to us, and we will treat your data with care and respect. We know that you care how information and data about you is collected, used and shared.

We reserve the right change this Statement at any time and urge you to review our Statment regulary to familiarize yourself with any changes.</p>
        <p><b>By visiting our website, using our online products/services, downloading/installing and/or using our application on a mobile phone, and/or by voluntarily submitting information to us via online forms, advertisement responses, mobile applications, and/or electronic mail, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement.</b></p>
        
        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>Now Communications has developed and licenses a system software product called Now Communications which allows Network Marketers to promote a legal and ethical network marketing opportunity and/or Client program and/or opportunities or programs of their choice.  The Now Communications system is designed to be used exclusively to promote the products and Services offered by the system.  However, due to the fact that each Now Communications account is controlled by an independent representative, we cannot guarantee how the system and privacy information will be managed by these representatives.</p>
        <p>Now Communications operates and manages the Now Communications System to assist network marketers in the building of their business on the Web.  Individuals that subscribe to the Now Communications System do so in one of two forms: prospects (sometimes referred to as Pre-Enrollees), and Members. Individual subscriptions to the Now Communications System are referred to as a "Member" in the Now Communications System.</p>
        <p>To cater to both you (the Customer) and our Members, we may be required to collect, use, and share certain information.  The type of information we collect, together with a description of how we use and/or share it, is described below.</p>

        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

        <h4>Information Collection</h4>
        <p>Now Communications, our partners, and the independent representative who are Members are the owners of the information collected on nowbackoffice.com.</p>
        
        <h4>Registration</h4>
        <p>In order to use this Web site, a user MAY first complete the registration form.  During registration a user [is required to] give[s] contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest.  It is optional optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as, username and password), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. If a person or company chooses to enroll in our network marketing business opportunity, we are require to collect the persons/user's social security number and if a company, we are required to collect their EIN number. These numbers are required to comply with IRS requirements and to provide this information to our associated network marketing business.</p>
        
        <h3>Order</h3>
        <p>We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders.  In addition, this information is given to the network marketing company for the purpose of enrollment and processing orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.</p>
        
        <h3>Information Use</h3> 
        <p>We will use personal information that we gather about you to provide the services that you have requested. In addition, if you have a free trial account with Now Communications, then we will use the information gathered about you to share more information about our business in an attempt to convince you to make a purchase from us or our associated companies.  Now Communications and the person/affiliate who sent you to this site will be granted access to your personal contact (name, phone number, and email)  information so that they can communicate with you in an attempt to "sell" various products, services, and memberships to you.</p>

        <h4>Profile</h4>
        <p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users.  A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences.  Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user.s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do share your profile with other third parties.  Your profile is shared together with your personally identifiable information.  YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION, SOCIAL SECURITY OR EIN NUMBER IS NEVER SHARED FOR ANY REASON WITH ANY OUTSIDE THIRD PARTY UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, EXCEPT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENROLLMENT IN OUR MLM OPPORTUNITES.</p>

        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user.s computer tied to information about the user.  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.  A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p> 

        <p>By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.  See the .Profile. section.</p> 

        <p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising</p>

        <h4>Log Files</h4>
        <p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.  IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service.</p>

        <h4>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons, Web Bugs, CSS, and similar functionality)</h4>
        <p>We employ or our third party advertising company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to users. personally identifiable information.</p> 
        <p>Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company.  That means, for example, that if a person visited .www.companyX.com., which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web site or advertising company would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the advertising company or Web site.</p> 
        <p>In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section. </p>

        <h3>Communications from the Site</h3>

        <h4>Special Offers and Updates</h4>

        <h4>Service Announcements</h4>
        <p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, we strive to ensure that their information is protected both online and off-line. However, please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
        <p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just "surfing".</p> 

        <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users. information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users. information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a secure facility.</p> 

        <p>If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to support@nowbackoffice.com.</p>

        <h3>Enhancement of Marketing Profile</h3>
        <p>We purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our users would be interested in.  We use this information to enhance or overlay the .profile. of individual users. This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to the users. personally identifiable information. See also the Profile.</p> 

        <h3>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
        <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), if a user no longer wishes to use our service, or otherwises wishes to review the user's personally identifiable information, a user may review, correct, update, or delete/deactivate the user's personally identifiable information by logging in to the user's account, or for additional assistance, by contacting support at support@nowbackoffice.com</p>

        <p>If, however, we are going to use users. personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.
