# Privacy Policy | Examiner.com

**Scope of This Privacy Policy**  
Thank you for visiting Examiner.com. The Examiner.com website, including any online environments made available by Examiner.com (collectively, the "Site") is operated by Clarity Digital Group LLC d/b/a Examiner.com ("Examiner.com"). Your privacy on the Internet is extremely important to us, and we want to make your experience on our Site satisfying and safe. This Privacy Policy applies to information about you collected through our Site. This Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into the [**Terms of Use**](http://www.examiner.com/terms_of_use) for our Site.

**Types of Information**  
We collect two types of information through our Site. " **PII** " means "personally identifiable information," which is information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us (including without limitation your name, address, email address, telephone number, age, background, or other personal information). " **Non-PII** " means "non-personally identifiable information" or information which alone does not identify you (however, in some circumstances Non-PII may be combined with PII in order to identify a specific individual).

**Your Consent to This Privacy Policy**  
By using our Site, you are agreeing to the collection, use, and disclosure of your PII and Non-PII as described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please email us at [legal@examiner.com](mailto:legal@examiner.com).

**Information Examiner.com Gathers and Tracks**  
In order to access or use certain services and capabilities on our Site or to participate in certain programs, you may be required to voluntarily submit certain PII through our Site. The use of these services or capabilities or participation in these programs is purely optional, so you are not required to submit any PII to Examiner.com if you do not wish to do so. For example, you may wish to provide PII to Examiner.com in connection with applying to become an Examiner on our Site (or providing further information once you are an Examiner, such as information in an Examiner's "bio"); creating a profile on our Site; applying to become an advertiser or sponsor on our Site; sharing content from our Site; participation in online forums, commenting features, communities, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, referral programs or other promotions; registration on our Site for any other reason; or submitting feedback to us. This information may include your name, address, email address, and other information you voluntarily provide to us, as well as information we may track regarding the articles you have viewed on our Site.

We also collect Non-PII through our Site. The Non-PII collected does not by itself identify you personally. However, if you have registered on the Site, it may be possible for us to link certain Non-PII to information that identifies you personally. Non-PII collected by Examiner.com includes: information sent to us automatically by your web browser such as your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed our Site, information on your operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari); the date and time of your visit; user traffic patterns and content accessed throughout our Site; and search terms you may enter in our Search function. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand our audience.

We track additional information regarding certain actions by Examiners on or through our Site, such as usage of various environments and tools offered to Examiners, participation in our educational offerings for Examiners, participation in loyalty programs offered to Examiners, posting of content on our Site, and other actions on our Site. Certain third party service providers also track Non-PII of users who visit our Site. This is described further below.

**How Information is Gathered**  
In order to improve your experience when using our Site, we, our third party service providers or advertisers may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer, which stores your preferences and may be used to help personalize your experience. We, our third party service providers or advertisers may also use "web beacons,” “pixel tags” or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor behavior and collect certain data regarding the actions of our users online. These cookies and other technologies may be used to track user traffic patterns, to enhance your experience when using our Site, to persist information through your session, to personalize the Site for you based on your preferences and selections, to target advertising or content to you as described further below, and to collect Non-PII about you and your visit to our Site for other marketing and business purposes. You can adjust your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. Disabling cookies may result in a less complete experience while using the Site.

**Third Party Advertising; Targeting of Ads and Content**  
We use third party companies to serve ads on our Site, to provide us with data collection, ad response measurement, ad or content targeting, and other marketing or related services. We have granted permission to these companies (some of which are listed below) and certain advertisers or customers of these companies to use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags or similar technologies in order to collect Non-PII about our users (subject to their own privacy guidelines) for purposes of generating advertisements and other content targeted to your interests, and for other data collection, response measurement, marketing and related business purposes.

Examiner.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their interests. We will not intentionally collect (nor intentionally provide to an advertiser or sponsor) information that a personally-identified user clicked on any particular ad. However, by clicking on, otherwise interacting with or viewing an ad, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad, and this may lead to similar ads being targeted to you on our Site and potentially on other Sites.

**Sharing of Information**  
We may share your PII with: (i) our current or future affiliates, subsidiaries, parent company, or other related entities (" **Examiner.com Entities** "); (ii) companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf (such as data storage, web hosting, Examiner application processing, or other services); and (iii) carefully selected third parties for purposes relating to content creation or distribution deals, selected Examiner.com or third party promotions we believe would be of interest to you, reward programs (such as the "Examiner Perks" program offered to current Examiners), marketing activities, ad targeting as described above, or other purposes relevant to the business of Examiner.com. PII submitted by purchasers of advertisements on our Site may be shared with companies processing such orders, and companies otherwise enabling such advertisements on behalf of Examiner.com.

An Examiner’s participation in the Examiner referral program represents the referring Examiner’s consent to the disclosure of that Examiner’s name to any person he or she refers who inquires as to the source of the referral.

We may also disclose the PII and Non-PII we collect through our Site when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or legal process (including a court order or subpoena); to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce the Examiner.com [Terms of Use](http://www.examiner.com/terms_of_use) or other agreements that you have entered into with Examiner.com Entities or that govern your use of our Site; to protect the rights, property or safety of Examiner.com, our users or others; or to protect your vital interests.

We may share analyses of our server logs, including details regarding Site usage and general information about our audience, with current or potential advertisers or business partners. Such disclosures will refer only to general, aggregate usage data from these analyses - never specific identifying information.

Information submitted to our Site is an asset of Examiner.com and will become part of our normal business records. Your PII may be transferred to another company that acquires the stock or assets of Examiner.com, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company's use of your PII will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and any privacy choices you selected in your online profile on our Site.

Please be aware that although we may request your consent for some disclosures described in this section, by using our Site you are deemed to have accepted and agreed to the sharing of your information collected through our Site in the manner described in this Privacy Policy, and we will not be required to obtain your consent for any disclosures described in this Privacy Policy.
