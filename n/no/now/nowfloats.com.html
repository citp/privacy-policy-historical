                <div class="general-content">
                    Before we start speaking legalese below, let's talk to you one on one. Our privacy policy basically states that we do not share your information, be it your business information or your updates with any third party, unless it is to better the service we can provide back to you.
					<br>
                    <br>
                    NowFloats takes your privacy very seriously, however, we also wish to explain that creating a website to be found, means you want to expose data to the world. Whereas this may include your customers, it also includes many other publics - who might not be excluded from viewing what you are talking about, just because you wish it so.
					<br>
                    <br>
                    We list below what information we get from you and how we use it or may use it in the future. So with a pinch of realism and a whole lot of tech-safety measures, let's jump straight into the Tech-Legalities 101.

                    Granting us permission to use your information not only allows us to provide NowFloats as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.
					<br>
                    <br>
                    While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share information we receive about you with others unless we have:
					<br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Received your permission;
                        </li>
                        <li>Given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or
                        </li>
                        <li>Removed your name and any other personally identifying information from it.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Of course, for information others share about you, they control how it is shared. We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above.
					<br>
                    <br>
                    Typically, information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted. For certain categories of data, we may also tell you about specific data retention practices. We may enable access to public information that has been shared through our services. We may allow service providers to access information so they can help us provide services.

                    If you want to stop using your service with NowFloats, you can get in touch with us to either deactivate or delete it.

                    <ul>
                        <li>

                            <br>
                            Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. People searching for it online will no longer find it, but we do not delete any of your information. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future.
                        </li>
                        <br>

                            When you delete your account, it is permanently deleted from NowFloats. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 180 days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it. Certain information is needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>                    
                    In case you have any issues with the product, the same should be reported during the demo period during business hours. No refund requests will be entertained after moving to a paid subscription and invoice being sent. Customer support will be available for the duration of the subscription of the paid product.
                    <br><br>
                    Any product of NowFloats does not guarantee:
                    <br><br>

                        <li>
                            A specific amount of business.

                        <li>
                            A specific position on any search engines in a specific amount of time.

                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    NowFloats is a marketing tool that helps your business get discovered online on search engines and get more business. It does not guarantee a specific search engine position or amount of business.
