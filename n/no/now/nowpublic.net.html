  <p>This Privacy Policy sets out the policies and practices of NowPublic Technologies Inc. ("NowPublic") with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of information, including personal information, collected through nowpublic.com (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy is part of, and incorporated into, the <a href="http://my.nowpublic.com/help/terms_and_conditions">Terms of Use</a> for our Site. </p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us, including without limitation your name, address, email address, telephone number, age, background, photos of yourself, or other personal information, as further defined under applicable laws.</p>
<p><b>Your Consent to This Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p>By using our Site, you are agreeing to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy, you may not use our Site.</p>
<p><b>This Privacy Policy May Change</b></p><b>
</b><p><b></b></p>
<p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of this Privacy Policy on the Site. Your use of the Site following any such change constitutes your agreement that all Personal Information collected from, or about, you through the Site after the revised Privacy Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>We may also email you and ask for your consent to use Personal Information previously collected in accordance with a newer version of this Privacy Policy. You may access the current version of this Privacy Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked "Privacy Policy" at the bottom of each page of our Site. </p>
<p><b>Collection and Use of Personal Information</b></p><b>
</b><p><b></b></p>
<p>NowPublic collects the following types of information from visitors to our Site:</p>
<p><b>Optional Voluntary Information</b></p><b>
</b><p><b></b></p>
<p>In order to access or use certain services and capabilities on our Site, or to participate in certain programs, you may be required to voluntarily submit Personal Information through our Site. The use of these services or capabilities, or participation in these programs, is purely optional - you are not required to submit any Personal Information to our Site if you do not wish to use or participate. </p>
<p>For example, you may wish to provide Personal Information in connection with:</p>
<ul>

<li>participating in referral programs or other promotions; </li>

<li>submitting feedback. </li></ul>

<p>Please note that if you use our Site to send content from our Site to a friend, we do not collect or store your friend's email or mobile device number, and the applicable message is considered to have been sent by you rather than NowPublic. </p>
<p><b>Usage Tracking</b></p><b>
</b><p><b></b></p>
<p>We may track user traffic patterns and content accessed throughout our Site, as well as use of various environments and tools offered to contributors within or through the Site.  We sometimes track and catalog the search terms users of our Site enter in our Search function, but this tracking is not associated with individual users. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers better understand our audience.  </p>
<p><b>Cookies and Advertising </b></p><b>
</b><p><b></b></p>
<p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it may enable us to relate your use of this Site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We generally use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when users visit the Site. </p>
<p>In the course of serving advertisements to this Site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These companies may use information (not including a user’s name, address, email address or telephone number) about user visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to our users. </p>
<p>If you would like more information about this practice or to prevent this information being used by these companies, visit <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx" target="_blank"> DoubleClick</a>, or our <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">online advertising networks</a>. </p>
<p>NowPublic may use cookies to track user traffic patterns, to enhance your experience when using our Site, to deliver information through your session, and to personalize the Site for you based on your preferences and selections. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. Disabling cookies may result in errors while using the Site.</p>
<p><b>Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser</b></p>
<p>We may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser, such as your IP address, the address of the Web page you were visiting when you accessed our Web Site, information on your operating system and browser, and the date and time of your visit. Such information does not identify you personally. </p>
<p>However, if you have registered on the Site, it may be possible for us to link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we might share our server logs - which may contain visitors’ IP addresses - with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals. </p>
<p><b>Publications on our Site</b></p><b>
</b><p><b></b></p>
<p>This Site allows you to publish Personal Information about yourself and others, including videos and photos. By publishing your Personal Information on such pages, you consent to the publication of such Personal Information. By publishing Personal Information about another individual, you represent that you have, where required by applicable privacy laws, obtained the consent of such individuals to publish such Personal Information.</p>

</ul>
<p>We may also use Personal Information sent to us by your web browser or by cookies to perform statistical analyses of our server logs in order to study the use and popularity of various areas of our Site, and we review IP addresses to analyze our audience source. </p>
<p>NowPublic may create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. However, we will not collect (nor provide to an advertiser) information about a specific identifiable user who clicked on a particular ad.</p>
<p><b>Sharing Personal Information </b></p><b>
</b><p><b></b></p>
<p>We may inform current or potential advertisers or business partners of the results of our analysis of our server logs, including details regarding Site usage and general information about our audience, however, such disclosures will refer only to general, aggregate usage data from this analysis - never specific identifying information. </p>
<p>We may share your Personal Information with: </p>
<ol>
<li>our current or future affiliates, subsidiaries, parent company, or other related entities ("Related Entities"); </li>
<li> companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf, for example, companies that provide support services to us (such as data storage and web hosting services); </li>
<li>and carefully selected third parties for purposes relating to content creation or distribution deals, joint promotions, marketing or other purposes to which you may consent.  </li>
</ol>
<p>We may also disclose the Personal Information we collect through our Site when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to:</p>

<li>prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; </li>
<li>enforce our Site’s <a href="http://my.nowpublic.com/help/terms_and_conditions">Terms of Use</a> or other agreements that you have entered into with Related Entities or that govern your use of our Site; </li>
<li>protect the rights, property or safety of NowPublic, our users or others; </li>
<li>or to protect your vital interests. </li>
</ul>
<p>Information submitted to our Site is an asset of NowPublic and will become part of our normal business records.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be transferred to another company that has acquired the stock or assets of NowPublic or our Related Entities, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company's use of your Personal Information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and the privacy preferences you have expressed.</p>
<p><b>International Transfer of Information </b></p><b>
</b><p><b></b></p>
<p>You acknowledge that although NowPublic is located in Canada, our parent company, Clarity Digital Group, LLC and certain other Related Entities are located in the United States.

<p>If you are located in a country other than the United States, you should note that, at present, the laws of the United States and certain other countries have not been approved by the European Commission or privacy authorities in certain other countries re providing "adequate protection" for personal information in the definition of the EU Data Protection Directive or applicable laws of other countries. </p>
<p>Please know, however, that no matter where your personal information is collected, used, transferred or stored, if it was collected through our Site, it will be protected by the terms of this Privacy Policy. <b>YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO THE USE AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN CANADA, THE UNITED STATES, OR IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE MANNER SET FORTH HEREIN. </b></p>
<p><b>Third Party Sites </b></p><b>
