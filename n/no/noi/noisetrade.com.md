In terms of being contacted for marketing purposes NoiseTrade LLC asks for your consent as you sign up for service.

### Will NoiseTrade LLC share my personal data with anyone else?

We may pass your personal data on to third-party service providers contracted to NoiseTrade LLC in the course of dealing with you. Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only to fulfil the service they provide you on our behalf. This may include order processing, shipment processing, customer support, analytics, and/or email marketing. When they no longer need your data to fulfil this service, they will dispose of the details in line with NoiseTrade LLC’s procedures. If we wish to pass your sensitive personal data onto a third party we will only do so once we have obtained your consent, unless we are legally required to do otherwise.
