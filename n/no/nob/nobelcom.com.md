Thank you for visiting NobelCom.com, a [Nobel Ltd. Company](http://www.nobelglobe.com/). NobelCom.com is committed to honoring the privacy of our members and visitors. 

**What information does NobelCom.com receive and how do we use it?** When you register as a Nobelcom customer and start purchasing our [calling cards](http://www.nobelcom.com/nobelcom/jsp/advisor/phone_card_advisor.jsp), we ask you for your name, contact information (telephone number, email), preferences, and certain demographic information. This information lets us provide personalized services for you in order to improve our level of service and to better meet your need for international phone services. 

Like most websites, we use small bits of data called cookies, stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us "remember" information about your preferences and passwords and allow you to move within our website without reintroducing yourself. Recent versions of browsers let you easily see and control cookies.

**May I choose what information I disclose?** While we need certain information to register you as a unique user and let you access personalized services, such as Recommended Products and My Accounts, other requested information is optional and may be given at your discretion.

**May I choose what communications I receive?** We occasionally send an email newsletter to NobelCom.com members to highlight features of our service. You can elect not to receive communications from us, either when you register or by noting your preference in response to communications from us.

**What if I need to review or change the personal information I previously disclosed?** We encourage NobelCom.com members to update and edit their personal information and keep it current. You can easily correct or update your personal information at any time via [My Account](http://www.nobelcom.com/nobelcom/jsp/accounts/account_prefs.jsp).

**What kind of security is used to protect my information?** We store all user information in secure databases protected by a variety of access controls. This data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement.

**Who has access to my information?** We do not share personally identifiable data with other companies, except as necessary to fulfill a transaction you have requested (i.e. your credit card company). NobelCom.com may be required by law to share such information in response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena.

**What about children's information?** Children may not register for NobelCom.com or use any NobelCom.com services that require personally identifiable information.
