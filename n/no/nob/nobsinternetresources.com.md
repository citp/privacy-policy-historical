### Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle Privacy Statement

Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle takes individual privacy very seriously. We are also aware of the threats to your security and privacy on the Internet. Please take a few moments to review the steps that Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle takes to ensure your privacy and security while giving you the best possible customer service as you use our web sites.

### Ordering Online

Any data you submit to us through an online order form is transferred to us via a Secure Sockets Layer—an encryption protocol—and is kept in databases that cannot be accessed from outside our firewall.

In other words, any data you send us is encrypted, so in the unlikely event a hacker intercepts your data, it cannot be easily read. Our firewall is a mechanism that prevents access to our servers by anyone outside of the company.

Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle does not sell or rent your name to anyone. That means that only authorized employees of Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle ever have access to any information you submit. We may use your name and address to send you information on other Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle products that may suit your interests. And, although we disagree with it, we must turn over any pertinent information to any law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it.

If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing list, please contact our customer service department by clicking the unsubscribe link included in every email we send out.

### E-mail

If you subscribe to Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle, your name and e-mail address will be placed in a database. As with all other personal information, only employees of Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle have access to this data. We do not give Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle addresses to outside companies. We will also never rent or sell our email address.

Any e-mail you send to Glazer-Kennedy Insider’s Circle is completely confidential. We will not add your name to our e-mail list without your permission. For security reasons, if your inquiry is about one of your subscriptions, we may ask you to submit some additional information only to verify your identity. Remember, in this case we are only asking you to confirm information you have already given us.
