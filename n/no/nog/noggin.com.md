### Information-Collection Policies

NickJr.com's target audience is parents of preschoolers (excluding the Playtime area, which is intended for preschoolers and their parents and which is governed by special information-collection policies--please see below for more on the Playtime area). NickJr.com's design, content, and language, as well as our activities, target a parent audience. We do request personally identifiable information from parents who choose to participate in certain activities available on NickJr.com, as described below. If we were to discover that a child submitted personally identifiable information, NickJr.com would delete the information immediately.

### Registered Membership

NickJr.com provides registered membership for our parent audience. In order to participate in our registered member activities, we ask users to submit personal information (e.g. full name, e-mail address, zip code, birthday). All such personal information is collected for the purpose of providing our users access to NickJr.com's registered members activities. Once registered, users can participate in registered member activities such as newsletters, message boards, NickJr.com advisory board (where members will be contacted by NickJr.com for feedback and opinions on various subjects), registered member sweepstakes (refers to those sweepstakes that are open only to registered members; for sweepstakes that are open to all grown-up users, please see "General Activities: Contests and Online Sweepstakes" section below) and "Third Party" offers (the opportunity for registered members to receive information concerning special offers and promotions sent by either NickJr.com on behalf of or in partnership with other third party businesses selected by NickJr.com or directly by such third parties). At any time after the registration process, registered members can choose to discontinue participating in some of the registered member activities (e.g. newsletters, NickJr.com advisory board, "Third Party" offers) or altogether unregister by electing to unsubscribe to such activity, which option can be found at the end of every NickJr.com correspondence sent to users.

### Use of Registered Members Information

All information collected during the registration process is used for the purpose of providing our users access to NickJr.com's registered members activities. For instance, if the registered member selected to receive newsletters, special announcements, offers and promotions from Nickelodeon, we use the information provided by such registered member to send them the requested information which we may send by e-mail and occasionally, by postal mail, for those who have provided us with mailing addresses. The information provided by registered members may also be shared with third parties as more fully described below in "Use and Disclosure of Information" and in the following manner. In connection with registered members who have indicated that they would like to receive "Third Party" offers, NickJr.com may sometimes share and transfer the personal information collected from our registered members with and to third party business partners selected by NickJr.com to promote, sponsor and/or fulfill our "Third Party" offers who will use such information to directly contact and send registered members special offers and promotions provided by the third party business partner. Other times, we on behalf of the third party business partner may send registered members third party special offers and promotions, but only if the registered member has requested such "Third Party" offers.

Once customers have successfully entered a valid credit card number/expiration date and completed the order process, an account will be created and maintained for customers.

We also may use this information to send our customers a print catalog based on the information provided.

As such, we do not share any personal information about our users in the Playtime area with any third parties. In addition, we do not condition a kid's participation in any games or other online activities contained in the Playtime area on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. Lastly, we provide a "bumper page" at certain points in the Playtime area of our site to let users know when they are entering an area that is limited to parents and we also provide a "bumper page" when linking from the Playtime area to an advertiser's site or other websites, which may have their own information practices that are different from ours, in order to let users know they are going to an advertiser's site or other websites.
