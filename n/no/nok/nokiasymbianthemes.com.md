# Privacy Policy of Nokia Symbian Themes Blog | Nokia Symbian Themes

COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY

This site is owned and operated by [Ishtiaq Saddam](http://www.nokiasymbianthemes.com/about). Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Nokia Symbian Themes, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.

Because we sometimes gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

INFORMATION NOKIA SYMBIAN THEMES GATHERS AND TRACKS

Nokia Symbian Themes gathers two types of information about users:

  * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our post comments, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys:
  * Information Nokia Symbian Themes gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers’ needs and which in turn help our potential advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because Nokia Symbian Themes derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does Nokia Symbian Themes divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.

Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.

3\. “E-mail this to a friend” policy

Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking “Share This”. The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose and you are really thanked by me if you do it.

4\. Polling

We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. I may use a system to “tag” users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.

5\. Surveys

I may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target my content to my audience. I sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with my sponsors, advertisers and partners. I never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.

Children

Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

Usage tracking

I try to track user traffic patterns throughout the site. However, I do not correlate this information with data about individual users. I do not break down overall usage statistics according to a user’s domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user’s browser).

I sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. I use tracking information to determine which areas of my site users like and don’t like based on traffic to those areas. I do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps me continue to build a better site for you.

Cookies

Nokia Symbian Themes may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer (like when you leave a comment and leave the site, in the future when you go to leave the comment then your name and details are automatically there in the comment box). The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.

Of course you can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.

##  _Privacy Policy Use_

USE OF INFORMATION

Nokia Symbian Themes uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience inside Nokia Symbian Themes, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users (like better customized themes).

As stated above, I use information that users voluntarily provide in order to better understand the needs of yours and to enable you to participate in comments, polls, surveys etc. I might send newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and might also send out special editions when I think subscribers might be particularly interested in something I am doing. Nokia Symbian Themes never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.

When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don’t like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don’t track which terms a particular user enters.

Nokia Symbian Themes creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don’t track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

SHARING OF THE INFORMATION

I use the above-described information to tailor my content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand my audience’s demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We will not share information about individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

SECURITY

I operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.

OPT-OUT POLICY

I always give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:

  *  **Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.** ****
  * **Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users**



YOUR CONSENT

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Nokia Symbian Themes. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
