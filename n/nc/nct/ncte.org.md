# Privacy Policy

UPDATED:  September 07, 2003 

The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) respects your privacy.  We will make every reasonable effort to ensure that any personal information you provide to us is used only for the purposes stated below.  While the policy presented here concentrates on information collected by the NCTE website, it also applies to personal information submitted by other means (mail, fax, phone, sign-up sheets, and so on). Several areas of the NCTE website require that you send us personal information:

  * Membership application
  * Convention registration
  * Convention session applications
  * Information requests
  * Award, grant, and contest applications
  * Store purchases
  * Professional portals (i.e. CoLearn and the My NCTE Page)



This information is received offline as well (mail, fax, phone). NCTE uses the demographic and professional information collected on membership, convention, and other forms for aggregate analysis, to personalize our member records for better service, and to create targeted mailing lists. This information is also included in convention attendee lists supplied to convention exhibitors and other responsible third parties. 

In addition to the primary purpose stated or implied at the time the information is collected, we may use your postal mailing address to send you information about NCTE programs or products, surveys, etc.  We provide our convention attendee data (including e-mail address, if supplied) to convention exhibitors and make it available to others.  We also make our member data available to companies offering NCTE member benefits and to other responsible third parties. 

If you supply an e-mail address, we use it to confirm your order, follow up on a request, etc., as the context determines. We may also use it to keep you informed about NCTE programs and initiatives. On occasion we may use your e-mail address for a purpose indirectly related to the original context (e.g., e-mailing a customer satisfaction survey to those who have made purchases from the NCTE catalog or in the NCTE online store).  With the exception of the convention attendee data, NCTE does not make its e-mail lists available to any third party. 

Personal information is also collected in the following areas, but is not reused in any form for any "secondary" purpose: 

  * Participation in special programs 
  * E-mail newsletter (Inbox) sent to nonmembers 



## NCTE members

Because of the special relationship we seek to maintain with our members, NCTE sends them periodic updates and announcements by e-mail.  We may also make an occasional phone call (e.g., to clear up a problem or inquire about a lapsed membership).  NCTE members have their own online profile page (within the My NCTE Page) where they can specify their preferred phone number and mailing address. 

## "Anonymous" information collected online

Generally speaking, you can visit the NCTE website without revealing any personal information about yourself.  We do keep a record of all server activity, which means that every page, image, or other type of file requested by your browser is written into a log file.  Each entry in the log contains, among other things, information about the computer you're using to connect to the Internet (its "IP address") and about your browser (e.g., which version of Internet Explorer you're using).  It does not, however, tell us anything about you personally.  We use aggregate data from the web logs to determine how the site's resources are being used and to refine its navigational structure. If the need arises, we may use the logs to trace the source of abusive or illicit activity. We do not share our web logs with any outside party. 

## Cookies

A "cookie" is a text file, stored on your computer, that includes information that identifies that computer and can be retrieved by our server to create a seamless browsing session.  Most cookies used on the NCTE site are deleted when your browser is shut down or in a fixed amount of time, whichever occurs sooner.  Members-only pages and other restricted areas use this type of cookie.Several areas of the NCTE website use so-called "persistent" cookies.  These files are retained on the user's hard drive after the browser is shut down.  For example, the online store uses persistent cookies that contain some personal information that a user has supplied (e.g., first and last name) and shopping cart data (to allow one to resume an interrupted shopping session).  Most browsers accept cookies by default.  If you set your browser to reject all cookies, these areas and others may not function properly.  Most browsers have a setting whereby the browser alerts you when a server attempts to place a cookie on your hard drive; you are given the option of accepting or rejecting it. 

NCTE's web server also places a persistent cookie used by our web log analysis software to identify returning visitors (actually, returning computers - see "Anonymous information collected" above).  This is valuable to us in assessing the website's effectiveness. 

For more information on cookies, visit this US government site. 

## Material submitted online

Some areas of the NCTE website allow you to submit questions (i.e., contact NCTE) or express your opinions (i.e., the NCTE-Talk Discussion Board).  All submissions become the property of NCTE.  Keep in mind that any information you post on any of the NCTE Discussion Boards are immediately available to anyone with a web browser.  Don't give out more information than what you would like everyone in the world to know.  You can, of course, edit or delete the messages you post there.  It should be noted that the e-mail address you submit as part of the registration process for the Discussion Board is not visible and cannot be retrieved by a member of the public.  That person can e-mail you, but the system hides your e-mail address; in fact, you will learn that person's e-mail address without revealing yours. 

## Links to other websites

The NCTE website contains links to other websites.  NCTE is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites.  Check the privacy policy of a website before revealing any personal information. 

## Exceptions

In certain circumstances, and as an exception to this privacy policy, we may, without notice to you, release information to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order, or in other special cases, such as, for example, suspected fraudulent or criminal activity, or an attempt to breach the security of NCTE or its website.

Privacy policy updates

We have tried to create a privacy policy that is comprehensive, readable, and durable.  Despite our best efforts, we may find it necessary to revise it.  Any changes will be made without prior notice. The current NCTE privacy policy will continue to be posted at this address ([www.ncte.org/privacy](http://www.ncte.org/privacy)).  If you have questions or comments about our privacy policy, please use [the contact us form](https://web.archive.org/forms/contactus).
