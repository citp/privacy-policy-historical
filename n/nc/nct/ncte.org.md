**Information We Collect about You and How We Collect It**. We collect several types of information from and about users of our Website, including information:

All User Contributions become the property of NCTE. Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Don't give out more information than what you would like everyone in the world to know. You can, of course, edit or delete the messages you post there.

  * Information about your computer and Internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, and browser type. 



Generally speaking, you can visit the NCTE Website without revealing any personal information about yourself. We use aggregate data that we collect automatically to help us to improve our Website and to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to:

  * Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Website according to your individual interests; 


  * Speed up your searches; 


  * Recognize you when you return to our Website. 



If the need arises, we may use the logs to trace the source of abusive or illicit activity. We do not share our web logs with any outside party. 

The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include: 

  * **Cookies (or browser cookies).** A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website. 


  * **Flash Cookies.** Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on our Website. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. 


  * **Web Beacons.** Pages of the Website and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit NCTE, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related Website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain Website content and verifying system and server integrity). 



We do not collect personal information automatically, but we may tie this information to personal information about you that we collect from other sources or you provide to us. 

**How We Use Your Information**. We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:

  * To present our Website and its contents to you. 


  * To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us. 


  * To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it. 


  * To provide you with notices about your membership, including expiration and renewal notices, and opportunities to engage with the organization on a wide variety of levels. 


  * To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection. 


  * To notify you about changes to our Website or any products or services we offer or provide though it. 


  * To allow you to participate in interactive features on our Website. 


  * In any other way we may describe when you provide the information. 


  * For any other purpose with your consent. 



Because of the special relationship we seek to maintain with our members, NCTE also sends them periodic updates and announcements by email. We may also make an occasional phone call (e.g., to clear up a problem or inquire about a lapsed membership). NCTE members have their own online profile page (within the My NCTE Page) where they can specify their preferred phone number and mailing address. 

We may also use your information to contact you about third-parties' goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

**Disclosure of Your Information**. We may disclose de-identified, aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. We may also disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy: 

  * To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business, who are obligated not to share the information with others. 


  * To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of NCTE's assets, in which personal information held by NCTE about our Website users is among the assets transferred. 


  * To third parties to market their products or services to you if you have consented to these disclosures, for example, as part of your convention registration. 


  * To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it; 


  * For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information. 


  * With your consent. 



Please be aware that NCTE does not share member data with other members, except in situations in which the member has given express permission to do so. If any member takes actions to attempt to use technological means to access information of other members through the website in contravention of this policy, NCTE reserves the right to terminate that member. 

The NCTE uses demographic and professional information collected on membership, convention, and other forms for de-identified aggregate analysis, to personalize our member records for better service, and to create targeted mailing lists. This information is also included in convention attendee lists supplied to convention exhibitors and other responsible third parties. In addition to the primary purpose stated or implied at the time the information is collected, we may use your postal mailing address to send you information about NCTE programs or products, surveys, etc. If you supply personal information, such as an email address, we use it to confirm any orders you may place through the Website, follow up on a request, or other such actions as the context determines. We may also use it to keep you informed about NCTE programs and initiatives. On occasion, we may use your e-mail address for a purpose indirectly related to the original context (e.g., e-mailing a customer satisfaction survey to those who have made purchases from the NCTE catalog or in the NCTE online store). 

It is important to note that we provide our convention attendee information, including certain personally identifiable information about you, to convention exhibitors and may make it available to others under certain circumstances. We also make our member data available to companies offering NCTE member benefits and other responsible third parties. With the exception of the convention attendee data, NCTE does not make its e-mail lists available to any third party, including other members of NCTE. Personal information is also collected in the following areas, but is not reused in any form for any "secondary" purpose: 

  * Participation in special programs 


  * E-mail newsletter sent to nonmembers 



For information about how you may, at no cost, opt-out of disclosures of your personal information, see the “Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information” section below. 

We may also disclose your personal information: 

  * To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request. 


  * To enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes. 


  * If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of NCTE, our customers, or others. 



**Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information**. We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information: 

  * **Tracking Technologies and Advertising.** You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe's website. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.

Proper access and use of information provided on the Website, including User Contributions, is governed by our Terms of Use. 

**Data Security**. We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.
