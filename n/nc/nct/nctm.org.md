# Privacy Policy - National Council of Teachers of Mathematics

_Updated August 2015_

The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (“NCTM”) has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for NCTM.org and all other NCTM-affiliated websites and Web and mobile applications (collectively, “NCTM websites”). 

##   
General Principles

  * We only use information collected on NCTM websites for NCTM purposes.
  * We deploy technology to protect the information you send us.
  * Cookies are used to keep track of information to allow a better user experience and this information is kept confidential within NCTM.
  * We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website.

  


## Content and Applications for School-Aged Children

If you are under 13, please have your parents/guardians read this policy and approve your use of the NCTM website or application. If you are under 13 and you participate in services requiring account registration, please have your teacher or parent register you for participation. When registering for an account for a Web or mobile application, we ask for a limited amount of personal information (such as your email address and an account password) to save and track your progress within the application. For NCTM websites and applications intended primarily for school-aged children, we do not ask for names or addresses and **strongly encourage use of a screen name that does not reveal any information about identity or location**.

  


## The NCTM Store and Conference Registration

NCTM websites use forms for members and other users to request information, products, and services and to register online for various programs, including conferences. We collect visitors’ contact information (such as email addresses), financial information (such as accounts or credit card numbers), and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). Contact information from order forms or surveys is used to send orders and information about NCTM to our members and other customers and to analyze website use. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications and bill the user for products and services. 

NCTM websites use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. We also use cookies to save and verify your password information if you choose to remain logged in over multiple visits.

  


## Third Party Websites

NCTM websites contain links to other sites. In the event you choose to access such third party websites, NCTM is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. We recommend that you check the applicable privacy policy of third parties before submitting any information to them.

  


## Security

NCTM websites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We will continue to employ reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.

  


## About This Privacy Policy

The foregoing is the current privacy policy of NCTM websites. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time without notice. Any changes to this policy will be posted on this webpage. Our policy does not create a contract or any legal rights.

This privacy policy applies solely to the information you provide while visiting NCTM websites. The terms of this privacy policy do not govern personal information furnished through other means, such as via telephone or postal mail.
