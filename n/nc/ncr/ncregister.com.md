# National Catholic Register Privacy Policy

This web site is owned and operated by EWTN News, Inc., a public charity based in the United States that supports the Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN). 

We recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. This Privacy Policy addresses those concerns and our commitment to protecting your privacy on this web site. The information we collect from you is used to improve the content of our web site and to provide you with information, products or other services available to you through EWTN News. This Privacy Policy may be changed or updated from time to time and we recommend that you review these terms periodically.

**Our Policy**

EWTN News respects and protects the privacy of our online visitors and donors. EWTN News does not disclose, give, sell or transfer to third parties any personal information about our visitors without their permission, unless required by law.

Throughout its history, EWTN News has never shared its donor mailing lists or personal information with third parties. It remains EWTN News's policy that mailing lists, both postal and electronic, are never sold or exchanged with third parties.

EWTN News is part of the EWTN family.  EWTN, EWTN Religious Catalogue, and EWTN News are related public charities that work together. Because EWTN News is a supporting organization of EWTN, EWTN is not a third party to this policy and we may share information between the public charities. 

**Some Information is Necessary to Complete a Donation or Fulfill an Order**

If you place an order with EWTN News, some of your personal information is required for us to process your payment, and ship the order to you.  We collect your name, address(es), phone number, email address, and payment information.  This information is used to fulfill your order and communicate with you about your order or donation.  EWTN News may telephone, send postal mail, or email you about the order and transaction. 

In order to detect fraud or security issues, the information you provide, and other information such as information automatically collected from website visitors may be analyzed by the devices we use in our infrastructure to detect fraud or security issues.

**Credit Card and Other Personal Information**

EWTN News uses industry standard efforts such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL) to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We make every reasonable effort to prevent the loss, misuse or theft of the information under our control. 

We care about the safety and security of online transactions. We use the industry standard high grade encryption and security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This method makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you send to us.

When handling your payment information, EWTN News uses security practices and technology that meets or exceeds Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) and requires the same of the payment gateways that process your payment card or banking information.

**Our Commitment to Accuracy**

In addition to maintaining privacy and security controls for information you share with us, EWTN News uses error checking procedures to accurately and completely process your transaction information. Our staff is available Monday through Friday from 9am to 6pm (US Eastern Time) to answer questions by phone at 1-205-271-2989 or by email at [viewer@ewtn.com](mailto:viewer@ewtn.com).

Changes are made to our error checking procedures as necessary to improve our system and independent external audits are periodically conducted to ensure the appropriate processing of your information from our web site.
