If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact Alex Yakovlev, Vice President, Information Technology, by [E-mail](https://web.archive.org/web/20081220155028id_/http%3A//www.nccn.org/about/emailform.asp?ID=3) or telephone (215.690.0258). 

## Information Collection and Use

#### Information Collection

NCCN is the sole owner of the information collected on www.nccn.org. NCCN collects information from our users at several different points on this web site. 

**NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology™ , NCCN Drugs and Biologics Compendium™, and NCCN Chemotherapy Order Templates™ Registration**

NCCN requests information from users of its NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology™, NCCN Drugs and Biologics Compendium™, and NCCN Chemotherapy Order Templates™. NCCN uses this information to contact the user about safety updates and/or services on our site for which they have expressed interest and to advise users about future updates to this site. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as specialty or year of graduation), but encouraged so NCCN can provide a more personalized experience on its site. 

**NCCN Conference and Symposia Registration**

NCCN requests information from the user on our annual conference registration form. Here a user must provide contact information (such as name and mailing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes for conference registration fees and/or hotel deposits. If NCCN cannot process an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. NCCN also requests contact information from users registering for regional guidelines symposia. This information is used to confirm registration data. Users do not need to provide financial information to register for regional guidelines symposia.

**NCCN Interactive CME Registration**

NCCN requires visitors to register to use NCCN Interactive CME archived presentations. Required information includes first and last name, degree, title, organization, mailing address, username, password and e-mail address. NCCN uses this information to process CME credit, to contact the user about services on this site for which he has expressed interest, and to advise users about future updates to this site. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as specialty or year of graduation), but encouraged so NCCN can provide a more personalized experience on its site. 

**Orders for NCCN Resources**

NCCN requires information from users who order NCCN informational resources through our on-line ordering system. Required information includes first and last name, shipping address, and e-mail address. This information is used to fill requesters’ orders. If NCCN cannot process an order, the information is used to contact the user. 

**NCCN Online Surveys**

From time-to-time, NCCN may provide you the opportunity participate in surveys on our web site. NCCN does not require information from users to complete these periodic online surveys about NCCN programs, services, and resources. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as specialty or year of graduation), but encouraged so NCCN can enhance its programs, services and resources. 

NCCN often uses a third party service provider to conduct these surveys; that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

**“Refer A Colleague”**

If you choose to use NCCN’s referral service to tell colleagues about this site or NCCN programs, services, or resources, NCCN will ask for your colleagues’ names and e-mail addresses. NCCN will automatically send a one-time e-mail inviting your colleague(s) to visit the site. Those whom you refer may contact NCCN to request that we remove this information from our database.

_Legal Disclaimer_

_Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)_

NCCN shares aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. For example, NCCN may describe the number of users by geography or medical specialty. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. NCCN encourages users to be aware when they leave the NCCN site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

#### Security

This web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When NCCN’s registration forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the industry-standard encryption software - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such as a registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just “surfing.” 

While NCCN uses SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, NCCN also does everything in its power to protect user information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in NCCN offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure, locked environment. 

If users have any questions about the security at www.nccn.org, they can [send an e-mail](https://web.archive.org/web/20081220155028id_/http%3A//www.nccn.org/about/emailform.asp?ID=4). 

#### Supplementation of Information 

For this web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users, it is necessary for NCCN to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. 

**Address Verification**

NCCN uses PCCharge Pro for credit card processing services to verify a user’s address for credit card processing. 

#### Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, NCCN provides a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by [E-mailing](https://web.archive.org/web/20081220155028id_/http%3A//www.nccn.org/about/emailform.asp?department=website) our User Support. 

#### Notification of Changes

If NCCN decides to change its privacy policy, NCCN will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places deemed appropriate so our users are always aware of what information NCCN collects, how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, NCCN discloses it. NCCN will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, NCCN is going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, NCCN will notify users via e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not NCCN uses their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if NCCN makes any material changes in its privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, NCCN will post a prominent notice on its web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where NCCN posts a notice we will also e-mail users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. 

#### Contact Information

If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20081220155028id_/http%3A//www.nccn.org/about/emailform.asp?department=website).
