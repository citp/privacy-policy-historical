						<p><strong>Bankrate, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Bankrate”), owns and 
								operates this Web site and portions of other Web pages and Web content through 
								which you have accessed this Privacy Policy (collectively, this 
								“Site”). By visiting, using and/or submitting information to this 
								Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the 
								terms and conditions of Bankrate’s Agreement of Terms of Use located at 
								the URL <a href="http://www.ncsreporting.com/TermOfUse.aspx">http://www.ncsreporting.com/TermOfUse.aspx
								</a>(the “Terms of Use”). </strong>
						</p>
						<p>Bankrate takes your privacy seriously, and has published this Privacy Policy to 
							explain how Bankrate treats all information you may submit to this Site, except 
							that information which is submitted pursuant to a sweepstakes entry. Refer to 
							the Official Rules and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for 
							Bankrate's specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure 
							pursuant to sweepstakes entry.
						</p>
						<p>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information<br>
							<strong>
								<br>
							</strong>Many of the features of this Site are available to you without your 
							providing personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable 
							information generally includes information that could be used to determine your 
							identity, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and birth 
							date. The following are certain situations in which Bankrate may collect 
							personally identifiable information from you:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Registration for Newsletters and Sweepstakes. </strong>Bankrate 
								collects personally identifiable information from you if you register online 
								for one of Bankrate’s newsletters and when you enter Bankrate’s 
								sweepstakes. When you register online with Bankrate, Bankrate asks for 
								personally identifiable information like your name, e-mail address, birth date, 
								gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, personal interests and other 
								demographic information.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Use of Forums. </strong>If you choose to transmit, submit or post 
								information through Bankrate’s chat rooms, bulletin boards or other 
								forums (the “Forums”), Bankrate will collect that information you 
								provide. Bankrate retains this information as necessary to resolve disputes, 
								provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law and 
								pursuant to Bankrate’s Terms of Use.</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Forms.</strong> Bankrate may collect personally identifiable 
								information from you if you choose to fill out any forms, profiles, or surveys 
								on this Site.</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Correspondence. </strong>If you send Bankrate personal correspondence, 
								such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send Bankrate 
								correspondence about your activities or postings on this Site, Bankrate may 
								choose to collect such information into a file specific to you.</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Business Partners. </strong>Bankrate may receive your personally 
								identifiable information from one of Bankrate’s business partners.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Use of Personally Identifiable Information
						</p>
						<p>Bankrate uses your personally identifiable information as follows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								to improve Bankrate’s marketing and promotional efforts, analyze site 
								usage, improve Bankrate’s content and product offerings, and customize 
								Bankrate's content, layout, and services;</li>
							<li>
								to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted 
								to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative 
								notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of this 
								Site;</li>
							<li>
								to fulfill your requests for certain products and services;</li>
							<li>
								for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and 
								protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity, to enforce 
								Bankrate’s Terms of Use, for other internal purposes, and as otherwise 
								described to you at the time of collection; and</li>
							<li>
								as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You expressly agree to Bankrate's use of your personally identifiable 
							information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.
						</p>
						<p>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</p>
						<p>Unless you are entering one of Bankrate’s sweepstakes, Bankrate does not 
							currently sell your personally identifiable information. The following 
							describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be 
							disclosed in the normal scope of business:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Advertisers</strong>. Bankrate may aggregate personally identifiable 
								information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable 
								manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and 
								promotional purposes. For example, Bankrate may aggregate personally 
								identifiable information and disclose it to network advertisers in a 
								non-personally identifiable manner as set forth in the section entitled 
								"Network Advertisers," set forth below. <u>Bankrate does not disclose 
									your information in a personally identifiable manner to such third party 
									advertisers without your consent</u>.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>External Service Providers.</strong> There are a number of separate 
								services offered by third parties, including, without limitation, 
								Bankrate’s affiliates, that Bankrate refers to as external service 
								providers that may be complementary to your use of this Site (e.g. credit card 
								issuers and financial institutions). If you choose to use these separate 
								services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant 
								them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your 
								information is governed by their privacy policy. With your consent, Bankrate 
								may provide some of your personal information to the external service provider 
								offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent Bankrate’s 
								disclosure of your personally identifiable information to an external service 
								provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. You 
								should evaluate the practices of external services providers before deciding to 
								use their services.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>NOTE: If you click to apply for a credit card on this Site, you may be 
								linked to an external service provider’s Web site. If you choose to apply 
								for an external service provider’s credit card, then all information you 
								disclose will be governed by the external service provider’s privacy 
								policy. Such links to external service providers are not an endorsement by 
								Bankrate of those external service providers and/or the products or services 
								offered there. Bankrate is not responsible for the privacy practices of 
								external service providers and encourages you to check the privacy policy of 
								external service providers. </strong>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Internal Service Providers</strong>. Bankrate may use third parties 
								that Bankrate refers to as internal service providers to facilitate or 
								outsource one or more aspects of Bankrate’s business, product and service 
								operations that Bankrate provides to you (e.g., technology, Forums, 
								newsletters/alerts, analytical tools, advertising campaign management) and 
								therefore Bankrate may provide some of your personal information directly to 
								these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject 
								to confidentiality agreements with Bankrate or other legal restrictions that 
								prohibit their use of the information Bankrate provides them for any other 
								purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced Bankrate related 
								operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to 
								them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may 
								collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of 
								the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional 
								information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to 
								you. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider 
								directly, then their use of your personally identifiable information is 
								governed by their applicable privacy policy.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bankrate reserves the right (and you authorize 
							Bankrate) to share or disclose your personally identifiable information when 
							Bankrate determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of your 
							personally identifiable information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring 
							legal action against you if:</p>
						<ul type="disc">
							<li>
								you are or may be violating this Privacy Policy or Bankrate’s Terms of 
								Use;</li>
						</ul>
						<ul type="disc">
							<li>
								you are interfering with another's rights or property, including, without 
								limitation, Bankrate's rights or property;
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul type="disc">
							<li>
								you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation;
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul type="disc">
							<li>
								necessary or required by any applicable law, rule or regulation; and/or
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul type="disc">
							<li>
								requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of 
								local, regional or national emergency.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Personally identifiable information and other personal information collected 
							from you may also be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, 
							acquisition, merger, reorganization, other transfer or bankruptcy (a 
							“Transfer”) involving Bankrate and/or its affiliates. Bankrate 
							specifically reserves the right to transfer personally identifiable information 
							collected from this Site, and any of its databases, together with any 
							personally identifiable information contained therein, to a third party in 
							connection with a Transfer, and nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to 
							interfere with the ability of Bankrate to transfer all or part of its business 
							and/or assets (including this Site) to an affiliate or independent third party 
							at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.</p>
						<p>In addition, due to the existing regulatory environment, Bankrate cannot ensure 
							that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable 
							information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this 
							Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), Bankrate 
							may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third 
							parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept 
							or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although Bankrate 
							uses industry standard practices to protect your privacy, Bankrate does not 
							promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable 
							information or private communications will always remain private.
						</p>
						<p>NOTE: If you are submitting personally identifiable information pursuant to 
							sweepstakes entry, Bankrate reserves the right to share, loan, rent and/or sell 
							the personally identifiable information that you submit with its affiliates and 
							other third parties. Please refer to the Official Rules and Privacy Policy for 
							each individual sweepstakes for the specific guidelines regarding information 
							sharing and disclosure.</p>
						<p>Network Advertising</p>
						<p>Bankrate may use third-party advertising companies for marketing, advertising 
							and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Using 
							third-party advertising companies helps us and third-party advertisers better 
							determine which advertisements or content to serve to you. For example, the 
							third-party advertisers may use information regarding your visits to this Site 
							and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and 
							services, that third party advertisers believe will be of interest to you.
						</p>
						<p>The types of information that may be collected by third-party advertising 
							companies include the following:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								the type of Internet browser you use;
							</li>
							<li>
								the type of computer operating system you use;
							</li>
							<li>
								the domain name of a Web site you visit, as well as information related to Web 
								sites and Web pages you are viewing when an advertisement is requested;
							</li>
							<li>
								whether or not you visit specific pages of this Site or other Web sites;</li>
							<li>
								the location of your Internet service provider's point of presence;
							</li>
							<li>
								the date and time of a visit to a Web site;</li>
							<li>
								search keywords passed from another server;
							</li>
							<li>
								the number of times you have clicked on an advertisement; and</li>
							<li>
								other interactions between you and a Web site.</li>
						</ul>

							information, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">click 
								here</a>. If you would like more information about this practice and to 
							know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/">
								click here</a>.

						<p>Newsletters and CAN-SPAM Compliance<br>
							<br>
							Bankrate sends only verified, double-opt-in e-mail newsletters, specifically 
							requested by Bankrate subscribers. Subscriptions to Bankrate newsletters are 
							verified by sending an e-mail confirmation to your e-mail address, which 
							requires a positive response before an e-mail address is added to 
							Bankrate’s list. Bankrate is fully compliant with the Controlling the 
							Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003.</p>
						<p>Cookie technology<br>
							<br>
							"Cookies" are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that 
							are inserted and stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive. 
							Bankrate, its external service providers, internal service providers, and 
							third-party advertising companies, may set and access cookies on your computer 
							to track and store preferential information about you. Bankrate, and its 
							external service providers, internal service providers, and third-party 
							advertising companies gather anonymous information about you through cookie 
							technology on an aggregate level only. For example, a third-party advertising 
							company may assign a cookie (and a Web beacon, described below) to you, to 
							limit the amount of times you see a particular advertisement or to help better 
							determine which advertisements to serve to you. Please note that most Internet 
							browsers will allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and 
							to delete cookies stored on your computer.</p>
						<p>Web beacons<br>
							<br>
							”Web beacons”, also called single-pixels (1x1) or clear GIFs, are 
							electronic images that allow a Web site to access cookies and help track 
							marketing campaigns and general usage patterns of visitors to those Web sites. 
							Web beacons can recognize certain types of information, such as cookie numbers, 
							time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web 
							beacon is placed. <em>No personally identifiable information about you is shared 
								with third parties through the use of Web beacons.</em>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Internal use of Web beacons.</strong> Bankrate may use Web beacons 
								internally to count users and recognize users through cookies. Access to 
								cookies helps Bankrate personalize your experience when you visit the Site.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Email.</strong> Bankrate may include Web beacons in HTML-formatted 
								email messages that Bankrate or its affiliates or agents send. Including Web 
								beacons in email messages helps Bankrate determine your interest in and the 
								effectiveness of such emails.</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>External use of Web beacons.</strong> Bankrate may also use Web beacons 
								externally. For example, Bankrate may report aggregate information about this 
								Site’s users, such as demographic and usage information, to its partners 
								and other third parties. Bankrate may also include other company’s Web 
								beacons within this Site.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Security<br>
							<strong>
								<br>
							</strong>Personally identifiable information you submit to Bankrate is 
							password-protected for your privacy and security. In certain areas Bankrate 
							uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. In the 
							unlikely event that an unauthorized third party compromises Bankrate security 
							measures, Bankrate will not be responsible for any damages directly or 
							indirectly caused by an unauthorized third party's ability to view, use or 
							disseminate such information.</p>
						<p>Links to Other Web sites<br>
							<br>
							This Site may include links to other third party Web sites. Such links are not 
							an endorsement by Bankrate of those Web sites and/or the products or services 
							offered there. Third party Web sites may have different privacy policies and 
							Bankrate is not responsible for the privacy practices of those third party Web 
							sites. If you click on a link to a third party Web site, Bankrate encourages 
							you to check the privacy policy of that Web site, as it may differ 
							substantially from that of this Privacy Policy.</p>

							</strong>This Site is intended to be accessed and used only by adults and is 
							not directed to children under the age of 18. Bankrate does not knowingly 
							permit registration or submission of personally identifiable information by

							Privacy Policy at any time in its sole discretion and without notice. Updates

							Policy. You are encouraged to revisit this Privacy Policy from time to time in

						<p>Governing Law; Arbitration<br>
							<strong>
								<br>
							</strong>This Privacy Policy is to be governed by and construed in accordance 
							with the internal laws of the State of Florida, without regard for principles 
							of conflicts of laws. Any civil action, claim, dispute or proceeding arising 
							out of, or relating to, this Privacy Policy shall be referred to final and 
							binding arbitration, before a single arbitrator, under the commercial 
							arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in Palm Beach County, 
							Florida. You and Bankrate shall select the arbitrator, and if you and Bankrate 
							are unable to reach agreement on selection of the arbitrator within thirty (30) 
							days after the notice of arbitration is served, then the American Arbitration 
							Association shall select the arbitrator. Arbitration shall not commence until 
							the party requesting it has deposited One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) with the 
							arbitrator as a retainer for the arbitrator's fees and costs. The party 
							requesting arbitration shall advance such sums as are required from time to 
							time by the arbitrator to pay the arbitrator's fees and costs until the 
							prevailing party is determined or the parties have agreed in writing to an 
							alternate allocation of fees and costs.</p>
						<p>Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and 
							conclusive upon you and Bankrate, and your and Bankrate's respective 
							administrators, executors, legal representatives, successors and assigns, and 
							may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the 
							previous sentence, in no event shall either you or Bankrate be entitled to 
							punitive, special, indirect or consequential damages, and both you and Bankrate 
							hereby waive your rights to any punitive, special, indirect or consequential 
							damages, including, but not limited to, damages for any loss of profit, revenue 
							or business.</p>
						<p>Miscellaneous<br>
							<br>
							If any portion of this Privacy Policy is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable 
							by any arbitrator, this Privacy Policy as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, 
							void or unenforceable, but only that portion of this Privacy Policy that is 
							unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from this Privacy Policy.</p>
						<p>The headings contained in this Privacy Policy are for convenience of reference 
							only, are not to be considered a part of this Privacy Policy, and shall not 
							limit or otherwise affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this 
							Privacy Policy.<br>
							<br>
							All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in this Privacy 
							Policy, as may be amended by Bankrate from time to time, shall survive your 
							acceptance of this Privacy Policy.</p>
						<p>This Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use represent the entire understanding and 
							agreement between you and Bankrate regarding the subject matter of the same, 
							and supersede all other previous agreements, understandings and/or 
							representations regarding the same.</p>
