## How the Information is Used

The North Carolina Educational Lottery, as the developer and manager of its websites, has taken several steps to safeguard the integrity of its data and prevent unauthorized access to information maintained. These measures are designed and intended to prevent corruption of data, block unknown or unauthorized access to our systems and information, and to provide reasonable protection of private information in the Lottery’s possession and within the Lottery’s control. When collecting private data from you, the Lottery utilizes Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input and prevents unauthorized viewing.

Typically, the information automatically collected and voluntarily submitted is used to provide website visitors with a more personal experience and to present them with information that is most pertinent to their specific needs. We also use the information to operate and improve our website, to gather and provide information about our products and services, and to gather user and customer information.

Reasonable care will be utilized to ensure that files and data contained therein which may personally identify you are kept in a secured location. However, please be aware that, except as protected by law, such information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to the North Carolina Public Records Act, N.C.G.S. §132-1 et seq. At the discretion of the NCEL, such files and/or data may also be routinely purged.
