# NCBuy: Service Center - Privacy Policy

|  | 

Your privacy is important to both of us, and we keep your details confidential. Mum's the Word!   
  
---|---  
  
NetCent Communications has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: NCBuy. Prior to disclosing how specific information is used, there are some terms that should be defined: 

TERMINOLOGY:

  * **AGGREGATE BASIS:** \- When information is shared with third parties on an _aggregate basis_ , said third parties can not link this information to any one specific person. This is broad demographic information. For example, a third party may know that 63% of visitors to NCBuy are women, but they do not know who these people are. 
  * **OPT-IN POLICY:** \- By definition, an _opt-in policy_ implies that a user must specifically ask to join a mailing list or a newsletter before they are added. Users are not subscribed to these listings by default. Users that specifically request a subscription may remove themselves at a later date. 
  * **DOUBLE OPT-IN POLICY:** \- By definition, a _double opt-in policy_ implies that a user must specifically ask to join a mailing list or a newsletter before they are added. After submitting a subscription request, a message is sent to the user requesting confirmation. If the user does NOT confirm their request, their subscription requests are not processed. The process of _double opt-in_ prevents one user from subscribing another user without their consent. Subscribers can remove themselves at a later date. 



LIST AND NEWS SUBSCRIPTIONS:

  * Through registration and contest entries forms, we provide users with the opportunity to subscribe to news and announcement listings. Listings are managed under a **double opt-in policy.**
  * Personal and demographic details gathered through subscription requests are shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. We do not share, sell, or rent listings that would disclose the personal details of an individual. 



COMPUTER INFORMATION:

  * We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. 
  * Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and is you to maintain your preferences for the site in some sections. 
  * Using normal Web server logs, we keep track of the types of Web browsers that users are accessing our site with. This information is used to determine which types of browser-specific services we should be launching. This information is not tied to any personal data. 



REGISTRATION FORMS:

  * Our site's registration forms require users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). This information is used to contact you only when necessary. Demographic and profile data collected at our site is considered personal and confidential. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis only. 
  * This site contains links to other sites. NCBuy is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.



ORDER FORMS:

  * Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. We do not share information regarding customer buying patterns. 
  * Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Information collected from surveys is used to contact the user, only when absolutely necessary, and with advertisers on an aggregate basis. 



CONTESTS AND SWEEPSTAKES:

  * We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our contests to notify winners. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. 



BANNER ADVERTISEMENTS:

  * We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. 



PUBLIC CHAT AND MESSAGE BOARDS:

  * This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 
  * By disclosing your personal information in a message board or chat room, you do so at your own risk. NetCent Communications cannot guarantee how other users in the message boards and chat rooms will use the information that you choose to disclose publicly.
