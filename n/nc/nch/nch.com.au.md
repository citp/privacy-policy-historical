## Introduction

We at NCH Swift Sound are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. NCH Swift Sound has established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information. 

For the purposes of this statement, "Personal Information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home. In general, you can visit NCH Swift Sound's Web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. 

If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Web, we may transfer that Information within NCH Swift Sound or to NCH Swift Sound's third-party service providers, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. 

NCH Swift Sound strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, NCH Swift Sound intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.

## Choice

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to NCH Swift Sound. The notice we intend to provide where NCH Swift Sound collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of NCH Swift Sound's Web sites, but you may be unable to download or purchase our software. If you chose to have a relationship with us, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.

## Security

Wherever your Personal Information may be held within NCH Swift Sound, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. Our site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. More specifically, our server uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security protection by encrypting all of your personal information including credit card number, name and address to prevent individuals from reading this information as it travels over the Internet.
