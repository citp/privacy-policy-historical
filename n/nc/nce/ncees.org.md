### Introduction

The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (“NCEES” or “we” or “us”) respects your privacy. We are committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who use NCEES products and services.

The purpose of this privacy policy is to assist end users in understanding NCEES’ use of personally identifiable information (PII) collected through ncees.org. It explains the types of information we collect, how and why we use it, the choices you have regarding the use of your information, and under what circumstances we may disclose it.

This policy covers ncees.org and all other NCEES-affiliated sites that link to this policy.

Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand our policies and practices related to your personal information. By using the NCEES website, you agree to the NCEES Terms of Use [hyperlink] agreement and this privacy policy. If you do not agree with this privacy policy and/or our terms of use, you should not visit the NCEES website.

### Information we collect

We collect and use your personally identifiable information (PII) to facilitate the licensure process with our member boards, which are the engineering and surveying licensing boards in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

### Personal Information

On our website, you may have the opportunity to register for an online account to access exam-related materials and information, register for and schedule an exam, and/or complete information required for an NCEES Record, Credentials Evaluation, or continuing professional competency (CPC) tracking. Many of these activities and services require you to provide personal information such as education, work experience, employers, supervisors, and work performance. We may also ask you to provide additional information such as name, postal address, telephone numbers, email address, date of birth, and country of citizenship.

### Technical information gathered automatically

While browsing our website or accessing any of our products and services, we may also collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs, may be used to count users who have visited those pages, to count users who have opened an email, and to compile other related website statistics. We may also use third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) that collect information about use of services and user traffic. The information we collect by automated means may include, without limitation, information about the devices you use to access NCEES websites, products, and services (such as the IP address, browser type, operating system, and type of device); dates, times, and duration of use (including whether you are a repeat or first-time visitor); and information on actions taken (such as page views and website navigation patterns).

Our sites may also contain links whose related cookies may collect data and track your movement and behavior on other sites. We are not responsible for these links, as they are not controlled by NCEES.
