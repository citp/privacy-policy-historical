What does the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision mean to my privacy at NCF?

The Supreme Court ruled in [R v Spencer](http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14233/index.do) that requesting the user information associated with an IP address constitutes a search which requires a valid search warrant to disclose. This means that ISPs such as NCF can only provide this information when a valid search warrant is furnished by the agency seeking the information. This has always been our policy and now has been endorsed by the Supreme Court.
