Northcentral University is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Statement of Privacy applies to the NCU family of Web sites and governs data collection and usage at all NCU sites and services. Please read the complete Statement of Privacy below to learn additional details about how some of these sites and services protect your personal information.

### Collection of your Personal Information

At some sites, NCU collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. At other sites, anonymous demographic information is collected, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, and preferences. Some sites collect a combination of the two types of information. Information collected at one University Web site may be shared within the NCU family of Web sites.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through NCU Chats, Communities, or other public online forums, this information may be collected and used by others. Your NCU Chat conversations, messages, e-mails, and Web Site Accesses are completely confidential.

Northcentral University encourages you to review the privacy statements of other Web sites that you visit so that you can understand how those sites collect, use and share your information. If you choose to follow links from NCU Web pages to other “external” Web domains, please note that NCU is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on sites other than those within the NCU family of web sites.

There may also be information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Northcentral University and may be shared with other Web sites within the NCU family of web sites. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the University Web sites.

### Use of your Personal Information

NCU Web sites and their operational service partners collect and use your personal information to operate University Web sites and deliver the services you have requested.  University sites also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from NCU and its affiliates. NCU may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

Northcentral University does not sell, rent or lease its lead, applicant, Learner, or mentor lists to third parties.  The University may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, NCU may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to NCU, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

Northcentral University keeps track of the Web sites and pages that its leads, applicants, Learners, and mentors visit within the University, in order to determine what sites and services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within the University to leads, applicants, Learners, or mentors whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

Northcentral University Web sites will not disclose your personal information, except if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on NCU or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of NCU, or an NCU Web site; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of NCU, its web sites, or the public.

Under the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 a Learner’s academic and financial files at the University will not be released to any third party without the written consent of the Learner.

### Use of Cookies

Many of the Northcentral University Web sites use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Northcentral University's pages, or register with University sites or services, a cookie helps the University to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same NCU Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the NCU services or Web sites you visit.

### Use of Web Beacons

Northcentral University Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow the University to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. NCU may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or University Newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on the NCU network of sites and services; they are a technique use to compile aggregated statistics about University Web site usage.

Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Northcentral University Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by our advertising partner, Avenue A, to help the University determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns.

### Control your Personal Information

Northcentral University offers its Learners choices for the collection, use and sharing of personal information. You may go to the Profile page to proactively make choices about the use and sharing of your personal information.

You may also stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from Northcentral University Web sites by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive. The instructions explain how to stop receiving such e-mails.

### Security of your Personal Information

Northcentral University secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. NCU secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted protection.

### Changes to this Statement

Northcentral University will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and leads, applicants, Learners, or mentors feedback. When NCU posts changes to this Statement, you will see the word "updated" next to the Privacy Statement link on the front page of Northcentral University. If there are material changes to this Statement or in how Northcentral University will use your personally identifiable information, the University will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. Northcentral University encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how NCU is protecting your information.
