      <h1>NGA.NET Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>TheNGA.NET Pty Ltd ("NGA.NET") website is owned and controlled by NGA.NET 
        located at Level 2 No 17 Raglan Street, South Melbourne Victoria 3205, 
        Australia.</p>
      <p>NGA.NET is committed to protecting user privacy and complying with the 
        Australian National Privacy Principles and other internationally accepted 
        privacy protocols.</p>
      <p>We understand and appreciate that visitors and users of this website 
        are concerned about their privacy, and the confidentiality and security 
        of any information that may be provided to us. This Privacy Statement 
        is designed to tell you about our practices in relation to the collection, 
        use, and storage of information that you may provide via this website. 
        Please be sure to read the entire Privacy Statement and Terms of Use before 
        using or submitting information to this website.</p>
      <h2>What information do we collect</h2>
      <p>NGA.NET does not collect Personal Information about you when you visit 
        the site. You can generally visit the site without revealing Personal 
        Information, unless you choose to provide such information. Information 
        you provide NGA.NET with directly will be collected, such as through subscribing 
        to our newsletter or completing an online application form. The only Personal 
        Information we collect is what you tell us about yourself.</p>
      <p>If you decide to complete an online application form, the information 
        you enter into the online form will only be collected by us if you submit 
        your online application. If at any stage you cancel your application or 
        log out prior to submitting your application, the information you have 
        entered up to that point will be automatically deleted.</p>
      <h2>Security of Information</h2>
      <p>NGA.NET take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable 
        information as you transmit your information from your computer to our 
        website and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorised 
        access, use, modification, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
      <p>However, you should keep in mind that the transmission of information 
        over the Internet is not completely secure or error-free. In particular, 
        e-mail sent to or from this website may not be secure, and you should 
        therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us 
        via e-mail.</p>
      <p>Personal data will not be transferred outside Australia unless we reasonably 
        believe that the information will remain subject to principles for fair 
        handling of the information which are substantially similar to the National 
        Privacy Principles and will not be collected, held, used or disclosed 
        by the recipients of the information in a manner inconsistent with this 
        policy.</p>
      <h2>Passive Information Collection</h2>
      <p>When visiting NGA.NET's web site, the site server makes a record of the 
        visit and logs the following information for statistical and administrative 
        purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the user's server address - to consider the user's who use the site 
          regularly and tailor the site to their interests and requirements;</li>
        <li>the date and time of the visit to the site - this is important for 
          identifying the website's busy times and ensuring maintenance on the 
          site is conducted outside these periods;</li>
        <li>pages accessed and documents downloaded - this indicates to NGA.NET 
          which pages or documents are most important to users and also helps 
          identify important information that may be difficult to find;</li>
        <li>duration of the visit - this indicates to us how interesting and informative 
          the NGA.NET site is to candidates; the type of browser used - this is 
          important for browser specific coding</li>
      </ul>

        your browser when you access information at that site. Cookies are either 
        stored in memory (session cookies) or placed on your hard disk (persistent 
        cookies). The NGA.NET Web site does not use persistent cookies. Upon closing
