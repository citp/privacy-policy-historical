NGINX, Inc. understands the importance of protecting your information. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to use it in a responsible manner. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, store, and use the information you provide. As our services change or expand, this policy might change; in the event of a change you will be notified promptly. 

**What information do we gather?**

When you visit our website and access information you remain anonymous. However, when you engage in certain activities on the site, such as requesting product information, downloading software, or entering contests, we might ask you to provide information about yourself such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and other personally identifying information. 

**How do we use the information we gather?**

We use the personal information we collect to provide you with information that you request or to record and support your participation in the activities you select. Any personal information we request is only used to assist in providing the highest level of customer care, including regular newsletters. To unsubscribe from such newsletters, click the “unsubscribe” link that appears at the bottom of the email.

**Do we share your personal information with third parties, such as service providers or consultants?**

All information you provide to NGINX, Inc. is kept confidential and never rented or sold. Information you submit might be shared with our distribution and reseller partners. However, if you prefer that your information not be shared with third parties, you can “opt out” of future sharing by emailing [nginx-inquiries@nginx.com](mailto:nginx-inquiries@nginx.com).

Cookies can also be used in the selection of the advertisements that appear on a Google search results page, or at a site in the Google Display Network (that is, ad content might be based on which pages you viewed during past visits to the NGINX, Inc. website). You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you on their [Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/) page. You can opt out of interest-based advertising by changing cookie settings in your browser or by using a [browser plug-in](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**Can you view, correct, or delete your personal information?**

To update or delete personal information you previously provided, please email [nginx-inquiries@nginx.com](mailto:nginx-inquiries@nginx.com).
