# Privacy Policy - Next Gen Web Solutions

**Privacy Statement**

This Privacy Statement applies to the website located at http://www.ngwebsolutions.com/ (the “Website”) which is owned and operated by NextGen Web Solutions, LLC (“Next Gen”). By using our Website, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to the terms set forth in this Privacy Statement, you may not use our Website.

**Information Governed by this Privacy Statement**

This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected through our Website, and it does not govern any information you may provide to us by phone or otherwise. “PII” means “personally identifiable information,” which is information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us (including without limitation you name, address, email address, telephone number, or other personal information). “Non-PII” means “non-personally identifiable information” or other information which alone does not identify you (however, in some circumstances it may be possible for Non-PII to be combined with PII in order to identify a specific individual). We sometimes refer to both PII and Non-PII in this Privacy Statement as “Information.”

**Collection of Your Information**

_Optional Voluntary Information_. In order to request a demo, request information about our products and services, or otherwise contact us through our Website, you may be required to voluntarily submit certain PII such as your name, school or university name, company name, and email address. The use of these functions through our Website is purely optional, so you are not required to submit any PII through our Website if you do not wish to contact us for these or other purposes.

_Usage Data_. Next Gen may track user traffic patterns and content accessed throughout our Website. This information allows us to better tailor our content to our users’ needs and to help our affiliated companies, advertisers and property owners to better understand our audience.

Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser. We may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser, such as your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed our Website, information on your operating system and browser, and the date and time of your visit. Such information does not by itself identify you personally. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network.

**Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies**

In order to improve your experience when using our Site, we or our current or future service providers may place a text file called a “cookie” on your computer, which may store preferences or other information, and may be used to help personalize your experience when using our Website. We use cookies to learn the source of traffic to our Website (including the site you were visiting before you came to our Website), and we may also use cookies to store your other preferences when using our Website. We or our third party service providers may also use other technologies to collect certain data regarding the actions of our users online, which may including “pixel tags,” which are small pieces of code embedded in emails sent to users. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. Disabling cookies may result in errors while using the Website. Because there is not yet a common standard regarding how to interpret web browser based “do not track” signals, our Website does not currently respond to undefined “do not track” signals. Our Website does not contain cookies or mechanisms to track users across their use of other websites.

**How We Use Information Collected on our Website**

Next Gen uses PII you have provided on our Website to deliver the information, product demonstrations, and services you have requested through our Website. If you request information on a product, or request a demonstration through our Website, one of our sales representatives will contact you with the information you have requested, and you will also be placed in our database to receive information regarding any of Next Gen’s products and services. We may send you emails from time to time with information on the products in which you expressed interest, information on other Next Gen products, or information regarding third party products or services we believe may be of interest to you. Next Gen may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
