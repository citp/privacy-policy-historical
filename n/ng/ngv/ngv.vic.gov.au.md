## Detecting and preventing cookies 

Many web surfers object to having files, like cookies, placed onto their hard drive without their permission. There are various things you can do to avoid cookies if you do not trust them, these include: 

  * Setting the browser cookie file to be Read Only. Whether you can do this or not may depend on what sort of Operating System (OS) or browser you are using. But if you can do this then the cookies will only last for as long as your browser is running. 
  * Setting up your computer to delete the cookies file whenever you start your browser. 
  * Many browsers allow you to set them up so that you are notified when a cookie is to be written to your computer. However there may be instances where there are so many cookies that it becomes annoying to reject them all. 
  * Installing a software product which will reject or manage cookies for you, these include Cookie Crusher, Cookie Pal and Cookie Cruncher. You can perform an internet search to find them. 



Disabling the cookies will impact on your ability to undertake the cookie related services listed above. 

_Web beacons_ are a means of determining who accessed a certain web page and when he or she did so. Web beacons are not used on this website and no third party collects information from this website. 

## Detecting and preventing Web beacons 

A Web beacon can be detected by viewing the source code of a Web page and looking for any IMG tags that load from a different server than the rest of the site. 

Turning off the browser's cookies will prevent Web beacons from tracking the user's activity. The Web beacon will still account for an anonymous visit, but the user's unique information will not be recorded.
