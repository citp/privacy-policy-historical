# 8thwonder - Privacy Policy

**About 8thwonder and the Information We Collect**

8thwonder is an online social networking community that connects people through networks of friends for dating or making new friends. To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles which are shown to the people in their personal network. A personal network consists of a user?s friends as well as the extended group of people that a user is connected to via chains of mutual friends. To fulfill the purpose of this site, some personal information we ask for is displayed to people within these personal networks.

8thwonder collects user-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify users and send notifications related to the use of the service. 8thwonder also collects user-submitted profile information such as gender, age, occupation, location, etc.

This is information we collect that is not personally identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all users to the site. 

**Use of Information Obtained by 8thwonder**

Information users submit to 8thwonder 

Profile information as well as first name and photos are displayed to people in a user's personal network, to support the function of the site as social networking community where users can meet new people through their friends. Email address and full name are used when a user invites a friend via email to join the service, when a user requests to add another user to their friend list, and when we send notifications to a user related to their use of the service. Except when inviting or adding friends, a user's email address is not shared or displayed with people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on 8thwonder with each other through the 8thwonder service, without disclosing email addresses. We may also use a user's email address to send weekly updates or news regarding our site, but the user may choose not to receive email of this type by accessing their Account Info.

We use your server, IP address, and browser-type related information in the general administration of our website.   
Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks 

Except where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law or for the protection of your membership.

**Use of Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Cookies are used to manage sessions on our site.

Users must enable cookies to use our site. Also, users may optionally use a cookie to remember their password in order to automatically log in to our site. We do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user which they did not intentionally submit to us. 

**Correcting/Updating or Removing Information**

8thwonder users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time by logging into their account and accessing features such as Edit Profile and Account Info. 

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**

If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. 

**Invite a Friend**

If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. 8thwonder will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. 8thwonder stores this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondant to the friends list of the user sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation. 8thwonder does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. The friend may contact 8thwonder to request the removal of this information from our database. 

**Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums**

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
