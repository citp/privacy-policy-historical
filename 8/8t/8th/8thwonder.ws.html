			<b>About 8thwonder and the Information We Collect </b><br>
			<br>
			8thwonder is an online social networking community that connects 
			people through networks of friends for dating or making new friends. 
			To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles which are 
			shown to the people in their personal network. A personal network 
			consists of a user?s friends as well as the extended group of people 
			that a user is connected to via chains of mutual friends. To fulfill 
			the purpose of this site, some personal information we ask for is 
			displayed to people within these personal networks. <br>
			Information Collected/Tracked by 8thwonder <br>
			Information submitted to 8thwonder <br>
			<br>
			8thwonder collects user-submitted account information such as name 
			and email address to identify users and send notifications related 
			to the use of the service. 8thwonder also collects user-submitted 
			profile information such as gender, age, occupation, location, etc.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Information not Directly Submitted by Users to 8thwonder </b><br>
			<br>
			This is information we collect that is not personally identifiable, 
			such as browser type and IP address. This information is gathered 
			for all users to the site. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Use of Information Obtained by 8thwonder </b><br>
			<br>
			Information users submit to 8thwonder <br>
			<br>
			Profile information as well as first name and photos are displayed 
			to people in a user's personal network, to support the function of 
			the site as social networking community where users can meet new 
			people through their friends. Email address and full name are used 
			when a user invites a friend via email to join the service, when a 
			user requests to add another user to their friend list, and when we 
			send notifications to a user related to their use of the service. 
			Except when inviting or adding friends, a user's email address is 
			not shared or displayed with people within a user's personal 
			network. Users within a personal network communicate on 8thwonder 
			with each other through the 8thwonder service, without disclosing 
			email addresses. We may also use a user's email address to send 
			weekly updates or news regarding our site, but the user may choose 
			not to receive email of this type by accessing their Account Info.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Information that users do not submit to us </b><br>
			<br>
			We use your server, IP address, and browser-type related information 
			in the general administration of our website. <br>
			Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks <br>
			<br>
			Except where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, 
			rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information 
			unless required by law or for the protection of your membership. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Links </b><br>
			<br>
			This site may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that 
			8thwonder is not responsible for the privacy practices of other Web 
			sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site 
			and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that 
			collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement 
			applies solely to information collected by this Web site. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Use of Cookies </b><br>
			<br>
			A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to 
			information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and 
			persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the 
			browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a 
			small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended 
			period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following 
			Internet browser help file directions. Cookies are used to manage 
			sessions on our site.<br>
			<br>
			Users must enable cookies to use our site. Also, users may 
			optionally use a cookie to remember their password in order to 
			automatically log in to our site. We do not and will not use cookies 
			to collect private information from any user which they did not 
			intentionally submit to us. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Correcting/Updating or Removing Information </b><br>
			<br>
			8thwonder users may modify or remove any of their personal 
			information at any time by logging into their account and accessing 
			features such as Edit Profile and Account Info. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</b> <br>
			<br>
			If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our 
			web site so our users are always aware of what information we 
			collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we 
			disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable 
			information in a manner different from that stated at the time of 
			collection we will notify users via email. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Invite a Friend</b> <br>
			<br>
			If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our 
			site, we ask them for the friend's email address. 8thwonder will 
			automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the 
			site. 8thwonder stores this email address for the purpose of 
			automatically adding the respondant to the friends list of the user 
			sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the 
			invitation. 8thwonder does not sell these email addresses or use 
			them to send any other communication besides invitations and 
			invitation reminders. The friend may contact 8thwonder to request 
			the removal of this information from our database. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums</b> <br>
			<br>
			Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
			information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, 
			or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by 
			others. In short, by posting personal information online that is 
			publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other 
			parties in return. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Security</b> <br>
			<br>
			Your 8thwonder account is password-protected. This web site takes 
			every precaution to protect our users' information. We use industry 
			standard measures to protect your information that is stored within 
			our database. We limit the access to your information to those 
			employees who need access to perform their job function such as our 
			customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the 
			security at our website, please contact us. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Email Choice/Opt-out</b> <br>
			<br>
			Users who no longer wish to receive our weekly updates or news may 
			opt-out of receiving these communications by following the 
			instructions contained in the email or by logging-in and changing 
			their settings in the Account Info section of the site. <br>
			<br>
			<b>Third Party Advertising</b> <br>
			<br>
			The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by our Web 
			advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. 
			Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each 
			time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks 
			may compile information about where you, or others who are using 
			your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are 
			clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver 
			targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest 
			to you. 8thwonder does not have access to or control of the cookies 
			that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks This 
			privacy statement covers the use of cookies by 8thwonder and does 
			not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. <br>
