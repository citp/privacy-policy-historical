**Last Revised: December 7 th, 2017**

The 8tracks Platform, including the website [http://8tracks.com](http://8tracks.com/), is owned and operated by 8tracks, Inc. (" **8tracks** " or " **We** "). We understand you value your privacy. At 8tracks, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. This statement governs information you provide to us or we learn from your use of the 8tracks Platform and tells you how we may collect, use and, in some instances, share this information.

_The Information 8tracks Collects_

  * **_Information You Provide_** : You may provide to 8tracks what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, age, zip code, email address, credit card number, postal mailing address, and telephone numbers) if you use certain services or products from the 8tracks Platform or otherwise use the features and functionality of the 8tracks Platform. 
  * _"_ ** _Automatically Collected_** _" Information:_ When you access the 8tracks Platform (including through your computer or your mobile device) or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, version of software installed, system type, your listening preferences, the content and pages that you access on the 8tracks Platform, and the dates and times that you visit the 8tracks Platform.
  * __
  * _"_ ** _Cookies_** _" Information_ : When you access the 8tracks Platform, we may send one or more cookies — small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer. 8tracks may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the 8tracks Platform in order to improve your experience, as explained in B below. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings.
  * __
  * _Your User ID_ : Your User ID is displayed throughout the 8tracks Platform and is therefore available to the public. Other people can see your feedback, ratings and associated comments, etc. Therefore, if you associate your actual name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your activities on the 8tracks Platform.



**_The Way 8tracks Uses Information_**. 8tracks uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the 8tracks Platform as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.

  * We may use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major 8tracks Platform updates, for customer service purposes, and to send privacy or security related notices. 
  * 8tracks uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the 8tracks Platform works and looks, and to create new features and functionality. 
  * 8tracks may use "Automatically Collected" information and "Cookies" information to: (a) automatically update the 8tracks application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the 8tracks Platform; (c) provide customized third-party advertisements, content and information both on and off the 8tracks Platform; (d) monitor and report on the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (e) monitor and report aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (d) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities; and (e) track and enforce any programming limitations adopted by the Service, including by way of example and not limitation, how frequently you may listen to a particular playlist within a defined time period.



**_When 8tracks Discloses Information_**. Please be aware that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the 8tracks Platform — such as when you publish contact information to complete your profile information — becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction. 

  * 8tracks may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate and/or anonymous non-personally-identifiable information (such as IP addresses, anonymous User usage data, listening preferences, referring or exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks) with interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality on the 8tracks Platform. 
  * We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide website hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist 8tracks in improving the 8tracks Platform and creating new services features. We contractually require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.
  * 8tracks may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. copyright or trademark law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.
  * 8tracks also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our Terms of Use; protect 8tracks from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the 8tracks Platform; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of 8tracks, our Users, or others.



**_Advertisers & Tracking – Choice Mechanisms_**. We may use third-party advertising companies to collect data and/or serve ads when you visit our Sites.
