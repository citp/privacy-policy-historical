<ul><h1>Privacy Policy</h1></ul>
<ul>
<h3>Introduction</h3></ul>
<p>The brands on this  website (the "Website") are owned by <strong>888ladies Bingo</strong> (the "Brand Owner"). The Website and the services offered on it are  powered by a software belonging to Brigend Limited ("Brigend") and  operated by Cassava Enterprises (Gibraltar) Limited ("Cassava"),  which are both within the same corporate group and registered under the laws of  Gibraltar to provide such services.<br>
  As such, all  personal data and customer funds are transferred to and stored by Cassava on  its servers in Gibraltar. Cassava is happy to provide you with online bingo  services under its remote gambling license issued by the Government of  Gibraltar, and is committed, along with the Brand Owner, (collectively the  "Company", "we" or "us"), to preserving the  privacy of all visitors to the Website.<br>
  When you use the  Company's&nbsp; services, you shall be asked  to provide personal identifiable information ("PII") to the Company.<br>
  The Company, as  mentioned above, is committed to respecting your privacy and to complying with  applicable data protection and privacy laws and we have therefore provided this  Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard your  PII for the purpose of offering you online bingo services. If you do not  understand the Privacy Policy or how we handle or use the PII which you provide  to us then you are invited to send in your questions to <a href="mailto:support@888ladies.com">support@888ladies.com</a> and we will do  our best to answer your questions in full as quickly as possible.</p>
<ul><h3>Personal Identifiable Information Collection</h3></ul>
<p>We collect PII  when you register and use our bingo services, make customer inquiries, register  for information or other services from the Company (including through Facebook  applications), or when you respond to communications from us (such as  questionnaires or surveys). The PII we will collect from you may include, for  example, your name, email address, home address, telephone number, debit/credit  card data and date of birth and other information collected on registration or  through surveys which the Company shall undertake.<br>
  </p><ul><h3>How Your Information is Processed  ("Purposes")</h3></ul>
<p>The PII which you  provide to us will be processed for one or more of the following Purposes: (i)  to allow us to provide you with bingo services; (ii) to process any of your  requests for information; (iii) to provide member support services to you; (iv)  to market our services or products or those of other entities existing within  the same group of companies in which Cassava exists (the "Cassava  Group") or those of the Brand Owner or any of their business partners and  affiliates ; (v) to notify you about updates to our software and/or services;  and (vi) to support any of the intended purposes specifically stated at the  time at which you provided the PII. </p>
<ul><h3>To Whom Your Information is Disclosed  ("Recipients")</h3></ul>
<p>Your PII may, for  the Purposes, be disclosed for processing to any of the following Recipients:  (i) to any companies within the Cassava Group and their employees who have a  need to know such information; (ii) to any third parties which provide services  to the Company in order to allow or enable us to provide you with bingo  services, including by way of example affiliate networks, payment processors  and data verifiers; (iii) to any auditors, contractors or other advisers  auditing any of Cassava Group's business processes; and (iv) to any potential  purchasers or investors in any company within the Cassava Group. Any processing  performed by any Recipients will, where required by law, be governed by a data  processing agreement in the form required by law, preserving any and all of  your statutory data protection rights and obligating the Recipients to respect  the PII and handle it in accordance with the relevant laws. <br>
  We ensure that  your information will not be disclosed to government institutions or  authorities except if required by law. <br>
  </p><ul><h3>Your Choice − Direct Marketing</h3></ul>
<p>Out of respect for  your right to privacy we are happy to provide you with an easy means to decline  receiving email/SMS offers from us. At any time, you may request to discontinue  receiving these offers by sending a blank message with the word  "Remove" in the subject area to <a href="mailto:support@888ladies.com">support@888ladies.com</a>.  If you would like to stop receiving our mail/SMS or telemarketing offers,  please call 0808 101 4776 or write to <a href="mailto:support@888ladies.com">support@888ladies.com</a></p>
<ul><h3>Your Rights in relation to your PII</h3></ul>
<p>You can write to  us at any time to obtain a copy of your PII and to have any inaccuracies  corrected. Where appropriate, you may have your PII rectified, amended or  completed. Please email <a href="mailto:support@888ladies.com">support@888ladies.com</a>.  We may levy a small charge to cover the cost of administration. </p>
<ul><h3>Security</h3></ul>
<p>We have  implemented suitable security policies, rules and technical measures to protect  and safeguard all the PII under our control from unauthorized access, improper  use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction or  accidental loss. All our employees and data processors who have access to, and  are associated with the processing of your PII, are obliged to respect your  privacy. </p>
<ul><h3>Cookies </h3></ul>
<p>We may send you a  permanent cookie when you register with us. A cookie is a small file that can  be placed on your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can  help us to recognize you when you next visit our website, note the  advertisements you click on and the other sites you enter via a link from our  website. This allows us to tailor the service we provide to your preferences.  We may also use the data generated from cookies to compile statistical data on  your use of our website. Our website uses four types of cookies: (i) 'session  cookies' which are stored only temporarily during a browsing session in order  to allow normal use of the system and are deleted from your device when the browser  is closed; (ii) 'first party cookies' / 'persistent cookies' which are set and  read only by our website, saved on your computer for a fixed period (usually a  year or longer) and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Such cookies  are used where we need to know who you are for repeat visits, for example to  allow us to store your preferences for the next login (such as user name and/or  password); (iii) 'third party cookies' which are set by other websites who run  content on the page you are viewing, for example by third party analytics  companies who monitor and analyze our web access; and (iv) 'flash cookies'  which are saved during game play to allow quicker and better gaming experience.  You are not obliged to accept a cookie from us or from any other website. You  can modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies. Please consult the  "Help" section of your browser for instructions on how to do so  correctly. However, for legitimate security reasons, we may refuse access to  specific website content unless you accept the use of a cookie or similar  device.</p>
<ul><h3>Advertisements</h3></ul>
<p>We use a  third−party advertising technology to serve advertisements when you visit our  websites. This technology uses information about your visits to our websites  (not including your name, address, or other personal information), to serve our  advertisements to you. In the course of delivering our advertisements to you, a  unique third−party 'cookie' may be placed or recognized on your browser. We  also transmit website usage information about visitors to our websites to the  servers of a reputable third party for the purpose of targeting our Internet  banner advertisements on the Website and other sites. To do this, we use 'Web  beacons' and 'cookies' provided by our third−party advertisement server on our  sites. The information that is collected and logged on our behalf through this  technology is not personally identifiable. If you do not want your non−personal  information used to target advertisements to you, please visit  www.networkadvertising.org and follow the "opt−out" instructions.</p>
<ul><h3>Protection of Minors</h3></ul>
<p>The services  provided by the Company are not intended for or directed to minors or persons  under the age of legal consent. Any person who provides us with PII represents  to us that they are 18 years of age or over the age of legal consent in their  jurisdiction. We reserve the right to access and verify any PII submitted by or  collected from you. If we become aware that a minor has attempted to or has  submitted PII, we may not accept this information and may take steps to remove  such information from our records.</p>
<ul><h3>International Transfer</h3></ul>
<p>Since we operate  globally, it may be necessary to transfer your PII to other companies within  the Cassava Group or to service providers of the Company and the Cassava Group  ("Service Providers") located in countries outside the European  Union. This may happen if our servers, the Service Providers, or such companies  are based outside the European Union, if you use our services and products  while visiting countries outside the European Union or if we transfer your PII  to such companies and Service Providers, and you hereby consent to said  transfer of your PII. The data protection and other laws of these countries may  not be as comprehensive as those in the European Union − in these instances we  will take steps to ensure that a similar level of protection is given to your  PII. </p>
<ul><h3>Retention</h3></ul>
<p>Your PII will not  be stored for any longer period than is necessary for the purposes for which it  was collected.</p>
<ul><h3>Information about us</h3></ul>

  This Privacy  Policy is subject to change, so please check it regularly. We reserve the right  to amend or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and in response to changes  in applicable data protection and privacy legislation. In the event the  Purposes change, we will notify you as soon as possible and, where required,  seek your consent where such notification relates to a new additional purpose  for processing. <br>
