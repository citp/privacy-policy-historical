## Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), the legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.

The Centre for Effective Altruism may process your Personal Data because:

  * We need to perform a contract with you
  * You have given us permission to do so
  * The processing is in our legitimate interests and it’s not overridden by your rights
  * We need to comply with the law



Where we rely on legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing your Personal Data, these interests are:

  * To keep our records updated and to study how our Service is used
  * To administer and protect the charity and web presence (including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, system maintenance, support, reporting and hosting)
  * To inform our marketing strategies
  * To best serve our charitable aims in the most efficient manner possible



## Retention of Data

The Centre for Effective Altruism will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Centre for Effective Altruism will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

## Transfer of Data

Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.

If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to United States and process it there.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

The Centre for Effective Altruism will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.

If any websites now owned by the Centre for Effective Altruism transfer ownership, for example because they spin off to become a separate project or are acquired by another nonprofit, your information may be transferred to the new owner.

## Disclosure of Data

### Disclosure for Law Enforcement

Under certain circumstances, The Centre for Effective Altruism may be required to disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).

The security of your Personal Data is important to us. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the data we collect. It is important to remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and therefore we cannot 100% guarantee the security of the Personal Data we collect.
