  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.

## Non-Personally Identifying Information

800Link collects non-personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 800Link’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how 800Link’s visitors use its website. From time to time, 800Link may release non-personally identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

## Potentially Personally Identifying Information

800Link also collects potentially personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. 800Link only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally identifying information as described below.

## Personally Identifying Information

Certain visitors to 800Link’s website choose to interact with 800Link in ways that require 800Link to gather personally identifying information. The amount and type of information that 800Link gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with 800Link – by purchasing service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, 800Link collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with 800Link. 800Link does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Protection of Certain Personally Identifying Information

800Link discloses potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on 800Link’s behalf or to provide services available at 800Link’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using 800Link’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. 800Link will not rent or sell potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, 800Link discloses potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when 800Link believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 800Link, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an 800Link website and have supplied your email address, 800Link may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with 800Link.
