By using the US Site, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want to accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the US Site. The US Site is operated, under license, by YNAP Corporation, a Delaware corporation having an address at 100 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10011 ("YOOX USA"). YOOX USA is a subsidiary of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A., an Italian company having an address at Via Morimondo, 17, 20143 Milano, Italy ("YOOX Italy"). Since personal data of users and customers of the US Site may be processed in Italy, any such processing of personal data will be conducted in compliance with applicable US law as well as the Italian Data Protection Code (Legislative Decree no. 196 dated June 30, 2003). Pursuant to the Italian Data Protection Code, YOOX USA is the controller of personal data of users and customers of the US Site. As the controller of personal data, YOOX USA independently determines the purposes and means by which your personal data is processed, including all security measures.

Should the above be necessary in order to supply services to you or to execute contracts for the purchase of products between you and YOOX USA, the transfer of your personal data to any such countries will be carried out only after the execution of specific contracts between YOOX USA and all parties involved, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 

We wish to inform you that YOOX USA processes its users' personal data for purposes that are strictly connected to the supply of services through the US Site, the execution of contracts related to the sale and purchase of products on the US Site and, after receiving your consent, in order to send you information on new commercial initiatives which are strictly related to the US Site's activities and services. 

YOOX USA processes your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including by e-mail, only after receiving your consent. 

YOOX USA may have access to third parties' personal data which is directly disclosed by its users to YOOX USA, for instance when the user buys a product to be sent to a friend, when the user who pays the purchase price for a product is different from the recipient of such product, or when a user wishes to recommend to a friend a service provided through the US Site or the sale of a particular product posted on the US Site. 

In all cases involving the disclosure of information of a third party, you must obtain the consent of such individuals before disclosing their personal data to YOOX USA and have informed said individuals about this Privacy Policy.

Any such disclosure will be conducted, in each instance, without exceeding the original purposes for which your personal data was collected and subsequently processed.

In addition, your personal data may be disclosed to third parties in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental and judiciary inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, and (4) protect the rights or property of YOOX USA and YOOX Italy.
