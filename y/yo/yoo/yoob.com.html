ADDITIONALLY, Yoob WILL NOTIFY THE PROPER AUTHORITIES OF YOUR ACTIONS.
<br><br>
Traffic Usage
All account plans come with a predetermined amount of traffic allowance. We monitor all accounts and bill $1.00 for each gig of traffic exceeded. This amount is not prorated, meaning that 1 mb - 1 gig will be treated and billed as the same.
<br><br>
IRC
We currently do not allow IRC or IRC bots to be operated on our servers.
<br><br>
Server Abuse
Any attempt to undermine or cause harm to a server or customer of Yoob is strictly prohibited. As our customer you are responsible for all your accounts. Should you violate the Terms of Services outlined within, your account will be cancelled without chance of refund.
<br><br>
Refusal of Service
We reserve the right to refuse, cancel or suspend service, at our sole discretion.
<br><br>
All sub-networks, distributive hosting sites and dedicated servers of Yoob must adhere to the above policies, with the exception of system resources in respect to dedicated servers.
<br><br>
Billing
By the Account Activation Date of each month, Yoob shall either:
<br><br>
(1) debit the client's credit card (when such information has been provided by the client); or
<br><br>
(2) deliver, by e-mail or regular mail, an invoice in accordance with the applicable Service Fees for services rendered for the current month. When an invoice is delivered to the client, payment shall be remitted to Yoob by no later than the specified payment due date. Yoob shall be entitled to immediately terminate this agreement for client's failure to make timely payments. You will be provided with an invoice on a monthly basis. All credit cards are billed automatically on a monthly basis. It is the client's responsibility to ensure that they have sufficient credit to cover this transaction. In the event that there is insufficient credit, we will send an e-mail notification, at which point we will need to be provided with another credit card account number within 24 hours. If we do not receive a response within 24 hours, the account, and all accounts under that account plan, will be suspended.

Certain services carry a setup fee charged by Yoob to client, which must be paid by client in order to have use of said services. If client terminates this agreement, client shall be responsible for any and all outstanding fees owed to Yoob and agrees to pay any and all fees incurred by client. Because the services are provided on a monthly basis, the client will be responsible for service fees incurred each month, regardless of when client provides notice of termination.

Acceptable Use Policy
Revision date: 07/09/2012
<br><br>
As a provider of web site hosting and other Internet-related services, Yoob offers its customer (also known as "Subscribers") and their customers and users the means to acquire and disseminate a wealth of public, private, commercial and non-commercial information. Yoob respects that the Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and dissemination of information. However, when there are competing interests at issue, Yoob reserves the right to take certain preventive or corrective actions. In order to protect these competing interests, Yoob has developed an Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP"), which supplements and explains certain terms of each customer's respective service agreement, and is intended as a guide to the customer's rights and obligations when using Yoob' services. This AUP will be revised from time to time.
<br><br>
One important aspect of the Internet is that no one party owns or controls it. This fact accounts for much of the Internet's openness and value, but it also places a high premium on the judgment and responsibility of those who use it, both in the information they acquire and in the information they disseminate to others. When subscribers obtain information through the Internet, they must keep in mind that Yoob cannot monitor, verify, warrant or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information they acquire. For this reason, the subscriber must exercise his or her best judgment in relying on information obtained from the Internet, and also should be aware that some material posted to the Internet may be sexually explicit or otherwise offensive. Because Yoob cannot monitor or censor the Internet, and will not attempt to do so, Yoob cannot accept any responsibility for injury to its subscribers resulting from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive or illegal Internet communications.
<br><br>
When subscribers disseminate information from the Internet, they must keep in mind that Yoob does not review, edit, censor or take responsibility for any information its subscribers may create. When users place information on the Internet, they have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation and other harmful speech. Also, because the information created is carried over Yoob' network and may reach a large number of people, including both subscribers and non-subscribers of Yoob, subscribers' postings to the Internet may affect other subscribers and may affect Yoob' goodwill, business, reputation or operations. For these reasons, subscribers violate Yoob policy and the Service Agreement when they, their customers, affiliates or subsidiaries engage in the following prohibited activities:
<br><br>
Spamming:
Sending unsolicited bulk and/or commercial information over the Internet. It is not only harmful because of its negative impact on consumer attitudes toward Yoob, but also because it can overload Yoob' network and disrupt service to Yoob' subscribers. Also, maintaining an open SMTP relay is prohibited. When a complaint is received, Yoob will investigate and shutdown the account that is SPAMing. A $250 charge for violating this policy will be charged to the person initiating the SPAM. Furthermore Yoob reserves the right to prosecute for this violation. A $1.00 charge will be assessed PER EMAIL sent should Yoob choose to pursue and prosecute.
<br><br>
Audio/Video Streaming:
Audio/Video Streaming is not hosting friendly. As such, Yoob does not allow any streaming of audio or video content. Offending accounts will be suspended without noticed or terminated.
<br><br>
Adult-Oriented Content:
Yoob does not allow adult content and will suspend/terminate any offending account.
<br><br>
Large File Policy:
Yoob is not for file hosting and distribution - as such, customers may not host any files larger than 50MB in size that are observed to be available for the sole purpose of download. Such files include but are not limited to .ISO, audio/video files, .EXE files. If you are unsure whether your file is against this policy, please e-mail webmaster@yoob.com.
<br><br>
Obscene Speech or Materials:
Using Yoob' network to advertise, transmit, store, post, display, or otherwise make available child pornography or obscene speech or material is prohibited. Yoob is required by law to notify law enforcement agencies when it becomes aware of the presence of child pornography on or being transmitted through its network.
<br><br>
Defamatory or Abusive Language:
Using Yoob' network as a means to transmit or post negative, defamatory, harassing, abusive or threatening language.
<br><br>
Forging of Headers:
Forging or misrepresenting message headers, whether in whole or in part, to mask the originator of the message.
<br><br>
Illegal or Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks:
Accessing, illegally or without authorization, computers, accounts or networks belonging to another party, or attempting to penetrate security measures of another individual's system (often known as "hacking"). Also, any activity that may be used as a precursor to an attempted system penetration (i.e., port scan, stealth scan or other information-gathering activity).
<br><br>
Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses or Other Destructive Activities:
Distributing information regarding the creation of and sending Internet viruses, worms, Trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mail bombing or denial of service attacks. Also, activities that disrupt the use of or interfere with the ability of others to effectively use the network or any connected network, system, service or equipment.
<br><br>
Facilitation a Violation of this AUP:
Advertising, transmitting or otherwise making available any software, program, product or service that is designed to violate this AUP, which includes the facilitation of the means to spam, initiation of pinging, flooding, mail bombing, denial of service attacks and piracy of software.
<br><br>
Export Control Violations:
Exporting encryption software over the Internet or otherwise, to points outside the United States.
<br><br>
Usenet Groups:
Yoob reserves the right not to accept postings from newsgroups where we have actual knowledge that the content of the newsgroup violates the AUP.
<br><br>
Other Illegal Activities:
Engaging in activities that are determined to be illegal, including, but not limited to, advertising, transmitting or otherwise making available ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, fraudulently charging credit cards and pirating software.
<br><br>
Other Activities:
Engaging in activities, whether lawful or unlawful, that Yoob determines to be harmful to its subscribers, operations, reputation, goodwill or customer relations.
<br><br>
As we have pointed out, the responsibility for avoiding harmful activities just described rests primarily with the subscriber. Yoob will not, as an ordinary practice, monitor the communications of its subscribers to ensure that the comply with Yoob' policy or applicable law. However, when Yoob becomes aware of harmful activities, it may take any action to stop the harmful activity, including, but not limited to, removal of information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to the Internet, or any other action deemed appropriate by Yoob.
<br><br>
Yoob is also aware that many of its subscribers are themselves providers of Internet services, and that information reaching Yoob' facilities from those subscribers may have originated from a customer of the subscriber or from another third party. Yoob does not require its subscribers who offer Internet services to monitor or censor transmissions or web sites created by customers of its subscribers. Yoob reserves the right to directly take action against a customer of its subscribers. Also, Yoob may take action against the Yoob' subscriber because of activities of a customer of the subscriber, even though the action may affect other customers of the subscriber. Similarly, Yoob anticipates that subscribers who offer Internet services will cooperate with Yoob in any corrective or preventive action that Yoob deems necessary. Failure to cooperate with such corrective or preventive measures is a violation of Yoob policy.
<br><br>
Yoob will not intentionally monitor private electronic mail messages sent or receive by its subscribers, unless required to do so by law, governmental authority or when public safety is at stake. Yoob may, however, monitor its service electronically to determine that its facilities are operating satisfactorily. Also, Yoob may disclose information, including, but not limited to, information concerning a subscriber, a transmission made using our network, or a web site, in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, summons, discovery request, warrant, statute, regulation or governmental request. Yoob assumes not obligation to inform the subscriber that subscriber information has been provided and, in some cases, may be prohibited by law from giving such notice. Finally, Yoob may disclose subscriber information or information transmitted over its network where necessary to protect Yoob and others from harm, or where such disclosure is necessary to the proper operation of the system. However, Yoob will never sell information to other services or outside companies.
<br><br>
Yoob expects that its subscribers who provide Internet services to others will comply fully with all applicable laws concerning the privacy of online communications. A subscriber's failure to comply with those laws will violate Yoob policy. Finally, Yoob wishes to emphasize that, in signing the Service Agreement, subscribers indemnify Yoob for any violation of the Service Agreement, law or Yoob policy resulting in loss to Yoob or the bringing of any claim against Yoob by any third party. This means that, if Yoob is sued because of a subscriber's or customer of a subscriber's activity, the subscriber will be responsible for payment of any damages awarded against Yoob, plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
<br><br>
We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying the obligations of Internet users, including Yoob and its subscribers, as responsible members of the Internet. Any complaints about a subscriber's violation of this AUP should be sent to webmaster@yoob.com.
