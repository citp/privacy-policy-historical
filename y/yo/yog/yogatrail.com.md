For example, if you access third party services, such as social media services, through our Website we may collect information made available to us through those services in order to establish your identity, and to improve and personalize your use of our Website.  
You can choose to log on to YogaTrail by using your Facebook account. Facebook provides us with information that you have chosen to make available pursuant to your Facebook privacy settings.

### Cookies and Other Web Technologies

Cookies are small data text files that can be stored on your computer’s hard drive, mobile phone, or other device (if your Web browser permits), and that allow us to recognize you as a User when you return to the YogaTrail Website using the same computer and Web browser.  
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable most types of cookies. Please note that if your browser is set to refuse all cookies, some features of our Website may not function properly. 

When you visit YogaTrail.com, we may set and access cookies on your computer and use these cookies for the following general purposes: 

  * To improve the quality of our services by helping us to recognize your browser as a previous visitor, and by storing any user preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our Website. For example, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit.

YogaTrail does not store unencrypted personally identifiable information in the cookies.  
Our Website may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.

The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences, and to display advertisements on our Website and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.

We limit or restrict access to personal information about you to our employees (including our contractors or agents) who we believe reasonably need to know that information to provide or develop services or to otherwise perform their jobs. 

In addition, in order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on YogaTrail is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the YogaTrail Website. We also employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.

To protect any data stored on our servers, YogaTrail also regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to YogaTrail. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails, direct messaging, and similar means of communication with other Users of YogaTrail are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.

We recommend that you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. 

### Your Obligations
