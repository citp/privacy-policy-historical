In order to invite others to join our Platform, you may use the Services to send invitations to email addresses of people you know, even if they are not registered Users of YogaTrail. The names and email addresses of people you invite will be used to send your invitations.

You should be aware that when you contribute any Content to YogaTrail, you may be identifiable by other Users of our Website. Any personally identifiable information you choose to provide there can be seen, collected, or used by other Users, as well as other third parties who are accessing the Platform.

Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to allow us to share such information. 

We also may share certain pieces of aggregated anonymous information with third parties, including Premium Members of YogaTrail, advertisers, business partners and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of monthly visitors our website receives, or how many users have clicked on a particular advertisement. This information does not contain any personal information, and is used to develop content and services that we hope you will find of interest. 

### Accessing Your Information

We take all reasonable steps to ensure that your information is accurate, and complete. You can access and edit your information by visiting your Profile administration page on the YogaTrail Website, at any time.

For example, invitations you sent to other Users via YogaTrail, as well as your contributions to any part of the Website may remain visible to others after you have closed your account.

YogaTrail disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. 

### Information Security and Confidentiality

We want you to feel confident about using YogaTrail, and we are committed to protecting all the information we collect. 

We have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect the personal information you provide to us against unauthorized access and/or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We limit or restrict access to personal information about you to our employees (sometimes including our contractors or agents) who we believe reasonably need to be able to access that information to provide or develop services or to otherwise perform their jobs. 

In addition, in order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on YogaTrail is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the YogaTrail Website. We also employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.

To protect any data stored on our servers, YogaTrail also regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to YogaTrail. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails, direct messaging, and similar means of communication with other Users of YogaTrail are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. 

### YogaTrail Communications

As described in our [Terms of Service](https://www.yogatrail.com/terms-of-service), we will communicate with you through email, notices posted on our website, messages to your YogaTrail Message Account, or through other means available through the service, which may include mobile text messages. We may send you emails that inform you about the features of the Services, and we may also send you service messages relating to the functioning of the Services. We may also send you messages with promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, unless you have opted out of receiving such information. You can change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into your account and changing the settings related to your email notification choices. 

Please be aware that you cannot opt-out of receiving our critical service messages while you are a registered User. Also, if we send communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you should understand that you will pay any service fees associated with your receipt of such messages on your mobile device (including text messaging charges). 

### Children's Privacy

YogaTrail is a general audience site and does not offer services directed to children. Should an individual whom we know to be a child under age 13 send personal information to us, we will delete or destroy such information as soon as reasonably possible.

Parts of the YogaTrail Website contain links to other websites. Please be aware that those external websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.
