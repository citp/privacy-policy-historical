This Privacy Policy describes the information, including Personal Information about you that we collect through the Website, and how that information is used, maintained and, in some cases, shared. In order to fully understand your rights we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy.

“Personal Information”, is any information that enables us to identify you, directly or indirectly, such as your email address, name, shipping and billing address, telephone number, company name, credit card information, any form of identification number or one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.

By using or accessing the Website, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use or access the Website. We may, from time to time, revise or update this Privacy Policy. This may include making changes to the way we collect, maintain and store information. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post notice of the modifications to the Privacy Policy on www.yogaalliance.org. Please check the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Changes will become effective immediately. If you disagree with any of the terms of this Privacy Policy in its current form, or in the future, in any of its modified forms, your sole remedy is to discontinue your use of the Website.

For the purposes of the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”), the data controller is Yoga Alliance, whose registered office is at 1560 Wilson Blvd, Suite 700, Arlington, VA 22209.

### What Information We Collect About You and How We Use It

#### Information You Provide to Us

You can browse our Website without providing any personal information to us. Yoga Alliance gathers and retains personal information about you when you voluntarily submit it to us and automatically collects statistical information about visitors’ use of the Website. Information that you submit may be linked with statistical information about your access to and use of the Website.

#### Inquiries and Forms

If you choose to complete and submit a form or otherwise provide information through our Website when you make an inquiry, including but not limited to the “Contact Us” page, by phone or email, we may collect and retain the Personal Information you provide, including your name, postal or email address, contact information and any other data you submit.

#### Social Networking Activities

The Website includes the ability for you and other users to link to social networking websites. As a result, we receive information about you when you choose to post or otherwise share information about our Website on these social networking websites. We may also receive Personal Information about you from your social networking account depending on your privacy setting for that account; this may include name, profile picture, age range, gender, language, country and other public information. You can control this by adjusting your privacy setting on your social network account.

#### Account Creation

Before you can utilize some portions of the Website, we will require that you create an account and provide us with your first name, last name, and email address, and create a password. You may also need to verify your account post creation by email verification.

Some information may be posted on the Yoga Alliance Registry at the election of the registrant.

#### Financial Transactions

When you engage in any financial transaction through the Website, you will be asked to provide certain of your financial information, such as your debit card, credit card or PayPal account and billing or shipping address.

If you choose to participate in a survey, contest or other promotion on our Website Yoga Alliance may request personally identifiable information from you such as your name, contact information, age, demographic information, and other information you submit in connection with the survey, contest or other promotion. Participation is completely voluntary and you therefore can choose whether to disclose personally identifiable information. We may use third parties to administer our surveys, contests or other promotions or to sponsor them and information you provide may be shared with them in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you participate in a contest you are subject to its Official Rules which will be posted on the Website; winners may be required to provide additional information, for instance for verification, shipping or tax purposes.
