# Privacy Policy | Yola.com

[Yola](https://web.archive.org/) taking business online

**Last updated April 20, 2017**

This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Yola, Inc., with respect to your use of the website located at www.yola.com (the "Site") so you can make an informed decision about using the Site and the website creation and hosting services offered by Yola. 

Please note that this Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible in any manner for, any information you provide to third parties in connection with websites hosted by Yola ("User Sites") or how the third parties who operate such User Sites may use the personal information you provide to them. Such information is subject to the privacy practices of such User Site, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing information directly to them. 

## EU-U.S. and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework

Yola complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the European Union and Switzerland and the United States, respectively. Yola has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>. 

In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, Yola commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Yola by email at [support@yola.com](mailto:support@yola.com). 

Yola has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit <http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/> for more information and to file a complaint. 

Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel. 

Yola may also be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. 

Yola is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 

## Registration

Registration forms contain both mandatory fields (as indicated) and non-mandatory fields; if you choose not to complete the mandatory fields then Yola may not be able to respond to your request or activate your option choices. By using the Yola Toolset and/or the Yola Site, you consent to any transfer of personal information, collected by Yola, outside your country for the purposes of storing the information where Yola and/or its agents maintain their facilities. 

## Service Providers

In the event that Yola transfers your personal information to a third party that is acting as an agent, Yola will enter into a written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant principles, and also requiring that personal data is only processed for limited and specified purposes. 

## Hosted websites

Users publishing websites to a free subdomain or a custom domain managed by Yola, will be provided with DDoS protection and DNS management capabilities. Yola uses CloudFlare to provide DDoS protection and DNS services for the Yola Toolset, Yola Site and customer websites. A copy of CloudFlare’s privacy policy is available [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy). 

## Amendments

Yola may amend this Policy from time to time to remain consistent with the requirements of the Safe Harbor. We will post any revised policy on this Site, and we will provide email and/or other notifications of any substantial changes. Your use of the Site after the revised Policy has been posted will constitute your consent to such revised Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, you should subscribe to our blog RSS feed at <https://www.yola.com/blog/> or e-mail us at [support@yola.com](mailto:support@yola.com). This will not prevent Yola from using your personal information for the specific purposes for which it was collected. 

Our Postal Address is:

909 Montgomery St. STE 104, San Francisco, CA 94133

We can be reached via e-mail at [support@yola.com](mailto:support@yola.com).

## Personal Information

We collect two basic types of information with our service, namely personal information and aggregate information. As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name and e-mail address), and demographic and other information about an individual when directly linked to personally identifiable information. A user name may be personal information if it includes personally identifying information such as a first and last name. Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate” information (see below). 

## Aggregate Information

Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information on how you use our service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our service. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate information about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our service, and for advertising and marketing purposes. 

## Updating/Accessing/Amending Personally Identifiable Information

You have the right to access your personal information. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update your profile or delete it by clicking on the Profile link after you log in and then clicking the Delete Account link at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, you can email our Customer Support at [support@yola.com](mailto:support@yola.com). 

**Google Apps™ users:** Deleting the Yola app from your Google Apps™ Control Panel DOES NOT delete your Yola account. To delete your Yola account, please follow the instructions provided above. 

## Active Collection

Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Site. We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect your name, address, email address, user name and other contact and demographic information when you register and set up an account or contact us by e-mail or other means. We may also collect payment information if applicable. In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you voluntarily provide to us, such as in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site. 

For each visit of registered user of the Site (each a "Registered User") to the Yola website, our Web server automatically recognizes any header information that is shared with our Web server. Yola collects the IP address and header information, and may collect the following: 

  * The e-mail address of Registered Users of our website and the Yola Toolset, so that we and our partners may communicate with Registered Users; 
  * The e-mail addresses of Registered Users who post messages to our bulletin board, communicate with us via e-mail, and/or make postings to our chat areas; Aggregate information on what pages Registered Users access or visit; Registered User-specific information on what pages Registered Users access or visit; and Personal information may also be collected if you leave comments or other communications on the Site, such as on the Yola Bulletin Board and/or chat areas, and/or send email directly to Yola. By doing so your name and the content of your communication may be made public and can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. 



## Automatically Collected Information

As mentioned above, we automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you use the website, our systems may automatically collect your IP address and the type of operating system or browser you use. We may also collect information pertaining to your account activity, and standard access information, such as the time and date of your accessing the service and your usage of the service. We use such information for purposes such as compiling aggregated statistics about service usage, developing new features, and improving our services. 

We may also use cookie technology to collect information. Among other things, the use of cookies enables us to: 

  * Store Registered User’s preferences; 
  * Record session information, such as items that visitors and Registered Users add to their shopping cart; 
  * Record Registered User-specific information on what pages Registered Users access or visit; 
  * Alert Registered Users to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site; 
  * Record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors and Registered Users return to our site; and 
  * Deliver advertising targeted to your interests and ensure that visitors and Registered Users are not repeatedly served the same messages or offers. 
  * Third party vendors, including Google, show your ads on sites on the internet. 
  * Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to your website. 
  * Users may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page.](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/)



A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and the service may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and may not be able to access certain Site features or services. 

## Third Party Cookies

The use of cookies by our partners and affiliates is not covered by our Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our affiliates may use session id cookies on their websites to give you access to Yola discounts and promotions. Our integration partners use cookies within Yola in order for you to use the parts of the Yola Toolset that are implemented by these partners. 

## Links to Other Sites

If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Yola site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Yola. If you visit a third party website that is linked to from a Yola site, you should read that website’ privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information. 

## ShareThis

When you use ShareThis to bookmark and share our products and site, you will be taken to a third party site and note that their privacy policy governs the collection and use of the information collected on those sites. 

## Information about Children

Our service is not intended to be used by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 except in compliance with applicable law. 

## Use and Sharing of Information

In general, we use personal information we collect to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Site, newsletters and for the purpose for which the information was provided. We may also use the personal information we collect to improve the content of our Web page and to customize the advertising and the content and/or layout of our page for our visitors and individual Registered Users. We also use this information to notify Registered Users about updates to our website, and to contact Registered Users for marketing purposes. 

Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to Yola, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Yola uses or discloses the Information for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. 

Yola extends its toolset by using these 3rd party business partners, with whom we share some of the collected personal information: 

  * Online store provider (for user-initiated online store functionality) 
  * Domain registrar (for user-initiated domain registrations) 
  * Payment processors (for user-initiated payments) 



Yola will offer individuals the opportunity to opt-out whether their Personal Information is to be disclosed to a third party for a purpose other than for which it was collected. If you wish to opt out in this manner, please send an email to [support@yola.com](mailto:support@yola.com). 

In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US or Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Yola is potentially liable. 

We will not share the personal information we collect from you through the Site with any other company except as provided in this Policy, as it may be revised from time to time. Yola reserves the right to disclose or transfer such information to a third party if we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Yola, our users, our employees or the public, including without limitation to protect Yola or our users or the public from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Site, or if we believe in good faith that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person, or other irreparable injury, including economic interests of Yola or a third party, requires disclosure of the information. 

## Network and Information Security

We use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized release of or access to your personal data. However, we cannot guarantee that your information will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. If Yola learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Yola may also post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach, you should notify us at [support@yola.com](mailto:support@yola.com). 

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number, national ID, personal health information) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Credit card details are stored in our Payment Gateway’s highly secure Payment Vault that is fully compliant with the Payment Card Industry’s Data Security Standards. 

## Electronic Communication

We will communicate with you via email. Yola intends to send regular email updates and occasional promotional offers that may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of these mailings at any time.

Alternatively, you can email our Customer Support at [support@yola.com](mailto:support@yola.com).
