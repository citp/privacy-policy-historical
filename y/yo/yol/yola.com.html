    <h1>Yola, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated April 20, 2017</strong></p>
    <p>
      This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal
      information is collected, used, and disclosed by Yola, Inc., with respect
      to your use of the website located at www.yola.com (the "Site")
      so you can make an informed decision about using the Site and the website
      creation and hosting services offered by Yola.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that this Policy does not apply to, and we are not
      responsible in any manner for, any information you provide to third
      parties in connection with websites hosted by Yola ("User
      Sites") or how the third parties who operate such User Sites may use
      the personal information you provide to them. Such information is subject
      to the privacy practices of such User Site, and we encourage you to
      become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing
      information directly to them.
    </p>

    <h2>EU-U.S. and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Yola complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US
      Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce
      regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from
      the European Union and Switzerland and the United States, respectively.
      Yola has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the
      Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward
      Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and
      Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the
      policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the
      Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy
      Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit
      <a class="external" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, Yola
      commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use
      of your personal information. European Union or Swiss individuals with
      inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact
      Yola by email at <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yola has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under
      the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute
      resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council
      of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of
      your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed,
      please visit <a class="external" href="http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/">http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/</a>
      for more information and to file a complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these
      channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may
      be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yola may also be required to disclose an individual’s personal
      information in response to a lawful request by public authorities,
      including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yola is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the
      Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
    </p>

    <h2>Registration</h2>
    <p>
      Registration forms contain both mandatory fields (as indicated) and
      non-mandatory fields; if you choose not to complete the mandatory fields
      then Yola may not be able to respond to your request or activate your
      option choices. By using the Yola Toolset and/or the Yola Site, you
      consent to any transfer of personal information, collected by Yola,
      outside your country for the purposes of storing the information where
      Yola and/or its agents maintain their facilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>
      In the event that Yola transfers your personal information to a third
      party that is acting as an agent, Yola will enter into a written
      agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at
      least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant
      principles, and also requiring that personal data is only processed for
      limited and specified purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Hosted websites</h2>
    <p>
      Users publishing websites to a free subdomain or a custom domain managed
      by Yola, will be provided with DDoS protection and DNS management
      capabilities. Yola uses CloudFlare to provide DDoS protection and DNS
      services for the Yola Toolset, Yola Site and customer websites. A copy of
      CloudFlare’s privacy policy is available <a class="external" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Amendments</h2>
    <p>
      Yola may amend this Policy from time to time to remain consistent with
      the requirements of the Safe Harbor. We will post any revised policy on
      this Site, and we will provide email and/or other notifications of any
      substantial changes. Your use of the Site after the revised Policy has
      been posted will constitute your consent to such revised Policy. If you
      are concerned about how your personal information is used, you should
      subscribe to our blog RSS feed at <a href="https://www.yola.com/blog/">https://www.yola.com/blog/</a>
      or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.
      This will not prevent Yola from using your personal information for the
      specific purposes for which it was collected.

    <p>Our Postal Address is:</p>
    <p>909 Montgomery St. STE 104, San Francisco, CA 94133</p>
    <p>We can be reached via e-mail at <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      We collect two basic types of information with our service, namely
      personal information and aggregate information. As used herein, the term
      “personal information” means information that specifically
      identifies an individual (such as a name and e-mail address), and
      demographic and other information about an individual when directly
      linked to personally identifiable information. A user name may be
      personal information if it includes personally identifying information
      such as a first and last name. Our definition of personal information
      does not include “aggregate” information (see below).
    </p>

    <h2>Aggregate Information</h2>
    <p>
      Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of
      services or users from which individual user identities have been
      removed. In other words, information on how you use our service may be
      collected and combined with information about how others use the service,
      but no personal information will be included in the resulting data.
      Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so
      that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our service.
      This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of
      aggregate information, and we may share aggregate information about our
      users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us
      better understand and improve our service, and for advertising and
      marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Updating/Accessing/Amending Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
    <p>
      You have the right to access your personal information. If your
      personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire
      our service, you may update your profile or delete it by clicking on the
      Profile link after you log in and then clicking the Delete Account link
      at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, you can email our Customer
      Support at <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Google Apps™ users:</strong> Deleting the Yola app from
      your Google Apps™ Control Panel DOES NOT delete your Yola account.
      To delete your Yola account, please follow the instructions provided
      above.
    </p>

    <h2>Active Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit
      our Site. We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to
      us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect
      your name, address, email address, user name and other contact and
      demographic information when you register and set up an account or
      contact us by e-mail or other means. We may also collect payment
      information if applicable. In addition, from time to time we may collect
      demographic, contact or other personal information you voluntarily
      provide to us, such as in connection with your participation in surveys,
      sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on
      the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each visit of registered user of the Site (each a "Registered
      User") to the Yola website, our Web server automatically recognizes
      any header information that is shared with our Web server. Yola collects
      the IP address and header information, and may collect the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          The e-mail address of Registered Users of our website and the Yola
          Toolset, so that we and our partners may communicate with Registered
          Users;
        </li>
        <li>
          The e-mail addresses of Registered Users who post messages to our
          bulletin board, communicate with us via e-mail, and/or make postings
          to our chat areas; Aggregate information on what pages Registered
          Users access or visit; Registered User-specific information on what
          pages Registered Users access or visit; and Personal information may
          also be collected if you leave comments or other communications on
          the Site, such as on the Yola Bulletin Board and/or chat areas,
          and/or send email directly to Yola. By doing so your name and the
          content of your communication may be made public and can be read,
          collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used
          to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the
          personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these
          forums.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, we automatically receive certain types of information
      whenever you interact with us. For example, when you use the website, our
      systems may automatically collect your IP address and the type of
      operating system or browser you use. We may also collect information
      pertaining to your account activity, and standard access information,
      such as the time and date of your accessing the service and your usage of
      the service. We use such information for purposes such as compiling
      aggregated statistics about service usage, developing new features, and
      improving our services.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also use cookie technology to collect information. Among other
      things, the use of cookies enables us to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Store Registered User’s preferences;
        </li>
        <li>
          Record session information, such as items that visitors and
          Registered Users add to their shopping cart;
        </li>
        <li>
          Record Registered User-specific information on what pages Registered
          Users access or visit;
        </li>
        <li>
          Alert Registered Users to new areas that we think might be of
          interest to them when they return to our site;
        </li>
        <li>
          Record past activity at a site in order to provide better service
          when visitors and Registered Users return to our site; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Deliver advertising targeted to your interests and ensure that
          visitors and Registered Users are not repeatedly served the same
          messages or offers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Third party vendors, including Google, show your ads on sites on the
          internet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based
          on a user’s prior visits to your website.

    <p>
      A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique
      identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website’s
      computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers
      automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the
      setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from
      the sites you visit by editing browser options. However, if a browser is
      set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of
      the Site and the service may not function properly. For example, you may
      not be able to sign in and may not be able to access certain Site
      features or services.
    </p>

    <h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      The use of cookies by our partners and affiliates is not covered by our
      Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our
      affiliates may use session id cookies on their websites to give you
      access to Yola discounts and promotions. Our integration partners use
      cookies within Yola in order for you to use the parts of the Yola Toolset
      that are implemented by these partners.
    </p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>
      If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Yola
      site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot
      control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility
      for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third
      parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same
      privacy practices as Yola. If you visit a third party website that is
      linked to from a Yola site, you should read that website’ privacy
      statement before providing any personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h2>ShareThis</h2>
    <p>
      When you use ShareThis to bookmark and share our products and site, you
      will be taken to a third party site and note that their privacy policy
      governs the collection and use of the information collected on those
      sites.
    </p>

    <h2>Information about Children</h2>
    <p>
      Our service is not intended to be used by children under the age of 13,
      and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under
      the age of 13 except in compliance with applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>Use and Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
      In general, we use personal information we collect to process your
      requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services you
      request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions,
      products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate
      your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Site,
      newsletters and for the purpose for which the information was provided.
      We may also use the personal information we collect to improve the
      content of our Web page and to customize the advertising and the content
      and/or layout of our page for our visitors and individual Registered
      Users. We also use this information to notify Registered Users about
      updates to our website, and to contact Registered Users for marketing
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when
      individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to Yola, or
      as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Yola uses or
      discloses the Information for a purpose other than for which it was
      originally collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yola extends its toolset by using these 3rd party business partners, with
      whom we share some of the collected personal information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Online store provider (for user-initiated online store functionality)
        </li>
        <li>
          Domain registrar (for user-initiated domain registrations)
        </li>
        <li>
          Payment processors (for user-initiated payments)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Yola will offer individuals the opportunity to opt-out whether their
      Personal Information is to be disclosed to a third party for a purpose
      other than for which it was collected. If you wish to opt out in this
      manner, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss
      individuals received pursuant to the EU-US or Swiss-US Privacy Shield,
      Yola is potentially liable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not share the personal information we collect from you through
      the Site with any other company except as provided in this Policy, as it
      may be revised from time to time. Yola reserves the right to disclose or
      transfer such information to a third party if we believe in good faith
      that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is
      reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal
      process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights,
      property or safety of Yola, our users, our employees or the public,
      including without limitation to protect Yola or our users or the public
      from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Site, or
      if we believe in good faith that an emergency involving immediate danger
      of death or serious physical injury to any person, or other irreparable
      injury, including economic interests of Yola or a third party, requires
      disclosure of the information.
    </p>

    <h2>Network and Information Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized release of or access to
      your personal data. However, we cannot guarantee that your information
      will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the
      unauthorized acts of others. If Yola learns of a security systems breach,
      then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take
      appropriate protective steps. Yola may also post a notice on the Site if
      a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a
      legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive
      a free written notice of a security breach, you should notify us at <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The security of your personal information is important to us. When you
      enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social
      security number, national ID, personal health information) on our
      registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure
      socket layer technology (SSL). Credit card details are stored in our
      Payment Gateway’s highly secure Payment Vault that is fully
      compliant with the Payment Card Industry’s Data Security Standards.
    </p>

    <h2>Electronic Communication</h2>
    <p>
      We will communicate with you via email. Yola intends to send regular
      email updates and occasional promotional offers that may be of interest
      to you. You may opt-out of these mailings at any time. If you do not want
      to receive marketing and promotional e-mails from us in the future,
      please let us know by sending us an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a> or follow the
      unsubscribe instructions that are included in each email communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will not prevent us from sending you operational, account related or
      other non-marketing emails. If you wish to no longer receive these emails
      please deactivate your account by clicking on the Profile link after you
      log in and then clicking the Delete Account link at the bottom of the
      page. Alternatively, you can email our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.
