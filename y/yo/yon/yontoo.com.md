# Privacy Policy - Yontoo LLC

**Yontoo LLC Privacy Policy**

**1\. INTRODUCTION**

Yontoo LLC (the "Company", "we" or "us") welcomes you to www.yontoo.com (the "Site") and the Yontoo Platform downloadable browser add-on (the "Platform"). Downloading the Platform enables you to access and use other browser add-on applications (the “Apps”) available for download at the Site. The Platform, Apps, and any other applications, products, services, features, content, promotions or games offered from time to time by the Company in connection with its business shall be referred to herein as the "Services". The Company is based in the United States and the Services are hosted in the United States.

As set forth in the Company’s Terms of Service currently available at [<http://www.yontoo.com/TermsOfService.aspx>], the Services are general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us through our support page ([www.yontoo.com/Support.aspx](http://www.yontoo.com/Support.aspx)).

This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including those who use the Services without being registered with the Company and those who have registered with any Company Service. This Privacy Policy describes the Company’s collection and use of users’ personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that information is not otherwise publicly available on the Services. We also describe generally the Company’s practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account. Your access to and use of certain Services, including but not limited to certain Apps, may require you to accept additional terms and conditions or a privacy policy applicable to such Services.

The Yontoo Platform and Apps are free to download and use. Most Apps are supported by advertising, which means you will see additional display ads when using these Apps. These ads are not associated with any underlying website, and further information about these ads is available by clicking the "About This Ad" link in the ad display frame. If you are interested in purchasing an ad-free upgraded version of certain Apps, please visit the Site for more information. Further information regarding App advertising is also available at the Site.

**2\. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION**

_User Submitted Information_

**Registration Information** is the information that users must provide to the Company upon registration for certain Services (e.g., your user name, email address, and account password). Downloading the Platform does not require the submission of any registration information.

**Public Information and Posts** consist of comments or content that you may voluntarily post on or through certain to the Services, Site, and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, such as a user name and/or user picture. Public Information and Posts will always be public, which means it will be available to everyone and will be displayed in search results both on the Services and on external search engines.

**Third Party Information and Content.** If you access the Services through a third party connection or log-in, your user submitted information may also include your user name associated with that third party service, any information or content you have permitted the third party to share with the Company, and any information you have made public in connection with that third party service (collectively, "Third Party Information and Content"). Third Party Information and Content obtained in this manner will be governed by this Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions applicable to use of the Services. In addition, the Company may supplement the information we collect with information we obtain from third parties to improve the quality of the Services.

_Collected Information_

**Transactional and Site Activity Information.** When users access the Services, we collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits for marketing purposes. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, operating system and browser, including your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.

**Tracking Technologies.**   The Company may use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. These technologies may be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, links you have clicked and advertisements you have seen so that we can serve you more relevant ads when using the Services. The Company may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of Services to personal information obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the Company Website may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.

**Third Party Collection.** Third parties that support the Services by serving advertisements or providing other services, such as providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics may also use cookies and other tracking technologies described above to collect similar information. The Company does not control these third parties and their use of these technologies is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see [ www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., <http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies>). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see <http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html>. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to the Services or certain features thereof.

**3\. NOTICE AND MODIFICATIONS**

**Means of Notice and Privacy Policy Modifications.** This Privacy Policy is the means by which the Company provides you with notice about its collection and use of your personal information. The Company will not use your personal information in a manner different from what is described in this Privacy Policy. The Company may modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and each such modification will be effective upon posting on the Site.

**Location of Data.** The Services are hosted in the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information you provide transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States and other countries where data protection and other privacy laws may not offer the same level of protection as in your jurisdiction, such as the European Union. This includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.

**Linked Services.** The Services may also be linked to sites or services operated by the Company’s affiliates or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, rewards programs, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by third parties including, any online store. The Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the Services via a link, enable a third party service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. Users who visit a Company affiliated site should still refer to its separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.

Such examples include: advertising and marketing, developing or supporting products and features, processing payments, administering message boards, processing data or statistics, or assisting with the administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions and sweepstakes.

We may work with third party advertising networks and advertisers who help deliver these ads to you. We may share anonymized or aggregated information with third parties to improve the relevancy of the ads you see using the Services.

**5\. SECURITY**

The Company uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard user information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the Internet can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, the Company cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please notify us of the problem by emailing [PrivacyPolicy@Yontoo.com](mailto:PrivacyPolicy@Yontoo.com).

Note that after you uninstall the Platform, certain related files may remain on your system. These remnant files are a record of your previous download of the Company's software, and are not executable programs. These files help the Company to prevent fraud on the Services and to better service you if you choose to download the software again. We will not use the files to track you or otherwise collect or store information about you. If you have registered a user account with the Company, you may cancel your account at any time on the Site, and unsubscribe to Company promotional materials by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the applicable e-mail.
