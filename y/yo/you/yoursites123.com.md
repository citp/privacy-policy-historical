You can periodically delete cookies from your computer's hard drive, clearing out all historical data that may have been saved from your previous web surfing. If you delete cookies and return to a website, there is no cookie to recognize you by.

To promote a cookie-free internet, Yoursites123.com has a URL generator which eradicates the need for setting a cookie. It remembers your settings in a privacy friendly manner. It can be found at the bottom of the SETTINGS page.

If, however, we are going to use Individually Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our site for 30 days.
