**1\. Collection of Personal Information**

You are not required to provide us with personal information to use the Platforms. You do, however, have the option to provide us with certain personal information including, but not limited to, your name, the name of your school or college, your address, phone number, email address, background, demographic, educational, interests and other information.

**(a) Forms, Questions, and Prompts; Correspondence; Posting**


The primary method by which we collect personal information from you is through the use of forms, questions, and prompts. For example, we use forms, questions, and prompts to request information when you use the Platforms or when you participate in special events, including, but not limited to, sweepstakes, contests, surveys, polls, or submitting a scholarship application. Further, we may collect information that you volunteer through personal correspondence, including, but not limited to, emails or letters or when you post messages, comments or other information in one or any of the Platforms.

**(b) YouVisit Data Technologies**


When you visit any of the Platforms, we use log files, event data, GPS data, cookies, clear gifs, scripts, and other technologies (“YouVisit Data Technologies”) to collect and process certain information about you, including, but not limited to, your IP address, zip code and browser program.

**(i) Log Files, GPS Data, and Other Usage Data**




We use log files, event data, GPS data, and other usage data on the Platforms to collect and store certain information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. The information these server logs collect may include, but is not limited to, internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

**(ii) Cookies** 


We use cookies on the Platforms for various purposes, including, but not limited to, to improve the quality of our products and services and to store user preferences. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.

**(iii) Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs/Tracking Pixels) and Scripts </ul** 


We use clear gifs and scripts on the Platforms for various purposes, including, but not limited to, to help us better manage content across our Platforms by indicating to us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the browsing of users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages.

Some Web browsers may be configured to send Do Not Track signals to websites, or users may use similar mechanisms, to indicate a user’s preference that certain web technologies not be used to track the user’s online activity. The Platforms do not accept or process such Do Not Track signals or similar mechanisms.

**(c) Collaboration with Third-Party Partners**


In addition to collecting personal information about you from you, we may also collect personal information about you from our Third-Party Partners. For example, if you visit the website of a Third-Party Partner, in addition to the information you provide through forms, questions, and prompts or collected through YouVisit Data Technologies implemented on the website, we may also receive information about you from the Third-Party Partner itself. 

**2\. How We Use Your Personal Information**

We use your personal information for various purposes, including, but not limited to, offer or provide you with products or services, to respond to questions or communications from you, to send you emails about products or services, to ask you to participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes, and to produce research reports. Where applicable, we may also use your information to process your credit card payments, to fulfill your orders and/or requests, to facilitate your viewing of our Platforms, and to provide you with information about the Platforms and our Third-Party Partners. We also use this information to compile broad demographic and usage information about our users, including, but not limited to, to tailor users’ experiences at our Platforms by showing content in which we think users will be interested or according to users’ preferences, and to produce research reports.

This permits us to do many things, including, but not limited to, understanding how you and other users access and use the Platforms, which in turn enables us to provide a more customized, efficient, and valuable experience to you and other users.

**3\. How We Share Your Personal Information**

In some cases, we will share information we collect (including personal information) with our Third-Party Partners. We may share your information with those of our Third-Party Partners that manage certain aspects of the services we provide, including, but not limited to, maintaining our servers and processing or fulfilling orders for products and services you purchase through the Platforms.

You should carefully consider whether to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone may access your publicly posted information.

THIS SECTION IS APPLICABLE WHERE THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR) OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) APPLIES TO YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORMS. If the GDPR applies to your use of the Platforms, your data will be managed in accordance with this Policy and in compliance with requirements of the GDPR.

We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. We will not use your previously collected personal information in a manner materially different than represented at the time it was collected without your consent or explaining our legal basis for doing so. Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with this Policy, where this is required or permitted by law.

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information. You have the right to:

**(a) Opt-in**


If you are located in the EU, you have the right to opt-in to the collection, tracking and use of your personal information. We will not collect personal information from you unless you affirmatively accept our data practices as described in this Policy.

**(b) Request Access**


You have the right to request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

**(c) Request Correction**


You also have the right to request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

**(d) Request Erasure**


This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

**(e) Object to processing**


You may object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

**(f) Request restriction of processing**


This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

**(g) Request the transfer of personal information to you or a third party**


We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

**(h) Opt-out**


You will, at any time, have the right to opt-out or withdraw consent to the collection or use of your data. If you withdraw consent, please be advised that we may not be able to provide you with certain services and to perform certain functions. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent however, you may continue to use the Platforms in accordance with the Policy. You may withdraw your consent at any time by sending us an email, letter or by telephone using the contact information below. In addition, at any time we seek your consent we will remind you of your ability to opt-out at any time as well as setting out any other methods for doing so.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please Contact Us.

**(i) No fee usually required**


You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**(j) What we may need from you**


We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to seek to avoid the disclosure of personal information to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**(k) Time Limit to respond**


We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

**(l) Data Retention**


We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

**(m) Purposes For Which We Will Use Your Personal Information**


We will only use your personal information when the law permits such use. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:

  * Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
  * Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. Our legitimate interests include: 
    * To provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive, including to send you electronic newsletters, or to provide you with special offers or promotional materials on behalf of us or third parties;
    * To enable you to participate in a variety of the Platforms’ features;
