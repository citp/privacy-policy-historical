# Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

_Yoursearchweb_ 's privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that  _Yoursearchweb_  can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies. 

We collect information to provide better services to all of our users - from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which app you'll find most useful. 

**Information we get from your use of our services:**

**Cookies and anonymous identifiers**

We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a  _Yoursearchweb_  service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or  _Yoursearchweb_  features that may appear on other sites. 

**How we use information we collect**

We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect  _Yoursearchweb_  and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content - such as giving you more useful apps and information. 

**We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we'll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.**

_Yoursearchweb_  processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live. 

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. 

We also have security measures (such as firewall protection on our servers and PC's) installed to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the user information under our control. 

Users should also be aware of the following: 

a. The details users elect to post during the registration procedure or thereafter become the property of  _Yoursearchweb_  upon receipt by  _Yoursearchweb_ ; 

b.  _Yoursearchweb_  checks for the following information when using  _Yoursearchweb_  software: your operating system,  _Yoursearchweb_ Software version, browser version, connectivity, and information regarding your use and the configuration of the  _Yoursearchweb_ Software ("Parameters") . Parameters are collected in order to provide you with the Software and Services subject to the provisions of this privacy policy hereof and of the  _Yoursearchweb_ 's License Agreement (the "License"), as well as in order to verify that the terms and conditions of the License are not being violated; 

c.  _Yoursearchweb_  gathers information related to our users' use of the our Software (''Usage Patterns'') to better understand how such users, as a group, use the software and the various features thereof, as well as to help  _Yoursearchweb_  tailor offerings to user groups with specific profiles, and to conduct market research. The Parameters and the Usage Patterns may be used in the aggregate for commercial purposes, including without limitation, for marketing, co-registration to other services, promotional activities or any other activity, including, without limitation, the protection of  _Yoursearchweb_ 's proprietary and other rights all subject to the provisions herein.
