# Privacy Policy | Your Purebred Puppy

We may change this privacy notice from time to time by updating this page.

#### What information do you collect about me?

When you visit our site, we receive general information about the type of computer you're using, including IP address, browser and operating system, and which pages you visited.

We use this information only in aggregate form (as overall statistics) to help us evaluate how the general public navigates our site. For example, if we know that 25% of our visitors use the Chrome browser, or that 70% of our visitors read our page about Housebreaking, this is helpful information for improving our site. We don't share this information with anyone.

If you buy something from us, we receive only the information you give us to process your order, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and payment details. We use this information only for billing purposes, to send you an order confirmation by e-mail, and to fulfill your order. Of course we need to share it with the merchant bank for authorization and approval of your payment, but we never share it with anyone else.

#### Is it safe to buy from you over the Internet?

We've partnered with both _Paypal_ and _Authorizenet_ , a leading payment gateway since 1996, to offer safe and secure credit card transactions over the internet. Your information is encrypted (scrambled) so it can't be read by anyone else. You can shop at yourpurebredpuppy.com with confidence.

#### Will you share my information or email address with anyone?

No, your information is kept strictly confidential.

#### Do you use cookies?

Yes, to keep track of what you've put in your shopping cart, to provide social media features, and to analyze our traffic.

#### Are cookies harmless?

Yes. A cookie is just a tiny text file. It's not a computer program. It can't contain a virus. It can't "see" anything on your computer or change or take any data whatsoever from your computer. It really is harmless.

#### Do I need to accept cookies in order to use your site?

No. If you set your browser to refuse cookies, that's perfectly okay. You can still enjoy our site. Just be aware that the shopping cart can't function without cookies enabled, so if you disable cookies, you won't be able to place an order.

#### Who can I talk to if I have a question about my privacy?

Feel free to contact me (Michele Welton) at [author@yourpurebredpuppy.com](mailto:author@yourpurebredpuppy.com)
