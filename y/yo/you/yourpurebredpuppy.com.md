# Your Purebred Puppy - Privacy Policy

  


### What information do you collect about me?

> When you visit our site, we automatically receive information about the computer you're using, including IP address, browser and operating system, and which pages you visited. We use this information only in aggregate form (as overall statistics) to help us evaluate how the general public navigates our site. For example, if we know that 10% of our visitors use Macs, or that 25% of our visitors use the Firefox browser, or that 70% of our visitors read our page about Housebreaking, this is helpful information for developing and improving our site. We don't share this information with anyone else.

> If you buy something from us, we receive the information we need to process your order, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and payment details. We use this information only for billing purposes, to send you an order confirmation by e-mail, and to fulfill your order. Of course we must share it with the merchant bank for authorization and approval of your payment, but we don't share it with anyone else.

  


### Is it safe to buy from you over the Internet?

> Yes. We've partnered with Authorize.Net, a leading payment gateway since 1996, to offer safe and secure credit card transactions over the Internet. The Authorize.Net Payment Gateway protects your information by encrypting (scrambling) it so it cannot be read by anyone else on the Internet. They use the best encryption software available in the industry -- state-of-the-art, 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. So you can shop at yourpurebredpuppy.com with confidence. Your private information is safe.

  


### If I contact you or buy something from you, will I get stuck on a mailing list?

> No. Unless you give us specific permission to do so, you won't receive any email from us, other than an order confirmation if you buy something from us. You won't receive any junk or spam e-mail from us or from anyone else, simply because you contacted us or bought anything from us, 'cause we don't share your information. We would only send you special offers or newsletters if you specifically gave us permission to do so by signing up for them.

  


### Will you share my information or email address with anyone?

> **Absolutely not.** Your information is kept strictly confidential. We don't sell, rent, disclose, or share it with anyone, except with the merchant bank for processing your payment if you buy something from us, or if required by law, or if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

  


### Do you use cookies?

> Yes, for website analysis and shopping. A cookie is a tiny text file that assigns a unique identifier to your computer. When you visit our site, Google Analytics places a cookie on your hard drive so Google can recognize your computer as you browse through our site. This helps tell us, for example, which pages are most popular with our visitors. If you decide to buy something from us, our shopping cart software also places a cookie so you can continue to cruise around our site and then return to the cart to find your items still there.

  


### Do I need to accept cookies in order to use your site?

> No. If you set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, that's perfectly okay. You can still browse and enjoy our site. Just be aware that the shopping cart can't function without cookies enabled, so if you disable cookies, you won't be able to place an order.

  


### Are cookies harmless?

> Yes. A cookie is just a tiny text file. It's not a computer program. It can't contain a virus. It can't "see" anything on your computer or change or take any data whatsoever from your computer. It really is harmless. But you don't need to accept cookies if you don't want to. You can still enjoy our site.

  


### Should I be concerned about spyware or adware on your site?

> Nope. We don't use spyware, adware, pop-up ads, spam, or any other annoying or intrusive marketing techniques.

  


### What if you change your privacy policy?

> Any changes will be posted here, and will only apply on a going-forward basis, not a retroactive basis.

  


### Who can I talk to if I have a question about my privacy?

> Feel free to contact me at [author@yourpurebredpuppy.com](mailto:author@yourpurebredpuppy.com)
