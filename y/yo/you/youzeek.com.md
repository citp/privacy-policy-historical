##  How we collect and use personal information

When you sign up for a YOUZEEK account, you will be asked to use your Facebook account to log in. By doing this, you will share basic information from your Facebook account to your YOUZEEK profile.

We will use your personal information to provide the products and services that you have requested (including the eventual display of customized content and advertising), to communicate with you concerning your account and customer service issues, to ensure the technical functioning of our products and services.

If you are connected with your Facebook profile, you will share your Facebook user name and your Facebook profile picture with your Facebook friend who log in to YOUZEEK with their Facebook account.

Further, the default setting is that all your playlists are visible to your Facebook friends using the YOUZEEK service. If you do not wish for such use of your personal data to take place, you should not connect to YOUZEEK with your Facebook account.
