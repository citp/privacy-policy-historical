# Society for Endocrinology | Disclaimer

### Privacy Policy

All personal information transmitted or otherwise submitted to the Society for Endocrinology via this web site shall only be used by the Society to the extent permitted by applicable legislation, specifically the Data Protection Act 1998.

### Information about our organisation and website

Modern information and communication technologies play a fundamental role in the activities of an organisation like the Society for Endocrinology.

The Society is dedicated to ensuring that your privacy is protected in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. 

This statement explains the privacy practices of the Society, and may change from time to time so please check back periodically. Whilst the Society is committed to this privacy policy you may find that only parts of it relate to you depending on what services you are dealing with.

### **What information is collected about me by the Society for Endocrinology and how**?

The Society collects information about you for the following purposes:

  * Technical administration of the website 
  * Research and development 
  * Society membership 
  * Abstract submission
  * Event registration, booking and feedback 
  * Formal membership mailings – postal and email 
  * Marketing (where we have your consent for this purpose)
  * Contact by the media (where we have your consent for this purpose).



Information on the last two items will be collected upon application.  We will not ask for this information on an annual basis but will rely upon you to let us know if your choices change.

The Society therefore collects, uses and disseminates the personal information that is provided to us only in accordance with the policies outlined in this document. We may keep your information for a reasonable period for these purposes.

We collect the personal data that you may volunteer while using the following services: membership renewal, event registration, submission of abstracts and every time you email us your details.

### What non-personally identifiable information does the Society collect?

The Society may also collect non-personally identifiable information (that is, information that does not specifically identify you), such as aggregate use statistics. We may collect some basic information about your computer and internet connections, including: your Internet Protocol Address, your operating system (eg Windows or Mac), your browser software (eg Netscape or Internet Explorer), your Internet Service Provider (eg AOL or AT&T), your geographic location. The Society collects this information to improve its own website services, for example, to diagnose problems with our server, or administering our website.

### As a member, how is my information stored by the Society for Endocrinology?

The information you provide to the Society is stored on the Society’s own internal system and database and on a secure remote server. These systems are protected by industry-recognised secure methods and only Society staff or others acting on our behalf will be authorised to access the information you provide to us. 

### What else should I know about my privacy when using other websites?

Our membership websites enable Society members to communicate with other members and to post information to be accessed by members. The Society web site may contain links to other websites but the Society is not responsible for their respective privacy practices, content or data capture policies (eg cookies). 

### Children's privacy

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. 

### Disclosure

We do not disclose your personal data to other organisations other than as necessary for the purposes for which you have supplied your information. However, for the purpose of data integrity, information may be made available to other societies managed by BioScientifica Ltd, the Society for Endocrinology’s trading company, including those outside the UK, but only where they comply with similar data protection principles. An example would be where you provide an address change of one society; this will be used to update your address for any other society of which you are a member where BioScientifica also handles membership. In certain circumstances BioScientifica will offer you the means to disallow consent to disclosure throughout BioScientifica services by indicating in a box at the point on the site where personal data is collected or by contacting our Data Protection Officer. Otherwise by providing us with your information you consent to such disclosure.

We may also engage third parties to process information on our behalf subject to appropriate security protections being in place.

We may also disclose personal data in order to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation or if necessary for legal proceedings.

In order for you to attend an event delivered by a partner organisation, it may be necessary to exchange some contact information with them.

### Confidentiality/security

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be 100% secure, although we do employ industry standard techniques to secure your data. We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from: 

  * unauthorised access 
  * improper use or disclosure 
  * unauthorised modification 
  * unlawful destruction or accidental loss
