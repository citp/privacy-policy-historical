We respect your privacy, will use reasonable efforts to keep your Personally Identifiable Information private, and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others.

In order to access certain features and benefits on our site, you may need to submit “Personally Identifiable Information” (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name and email address, among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to us. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the site, the information you receive when using the site, and our ability to contact you.
