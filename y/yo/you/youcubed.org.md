# Privacy Notice (updated June 14, 2014)

Stanford respects your privacy, will use reasonable efforts to keep your Personally Identifiable Information private, and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless Stanford has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others.

## What Information this Privacy Policy Covers

In order to access certain features and benefits on our Site, you may need to submit “Personally Identifiable Information” (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name and email address, among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to Stanford. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Site, the information you receive when using the Site, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary means by which we communicate with you.

Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to information that we collect through the Site and does not apply to information that we may collect from you through other means such as by mail or over the phone.

## What You Consent to by Using Our Site

Please understand that by submitting any Personally Identifiable Information to us, you consent and agree that Stanford may collect, use and disclose such Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these terms, then please do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to us. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with any required Personally Identifiable Information, Stanford may not be able to provide you with the services and courses that can be offered on our Site.

## The Information We Collect

We gather the following types of information about users through the Site:

Non-Personal Information. When users come to our Site, Stanford may track, collect and aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were “clicked.” We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Site. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.

Cookies. Stanford also uses or may use cookies and/or web beacons to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of content and sites to which a user of our Site links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Site, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use. Essentially, cookies are a user’s identification card for the Stanford servers. Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers that allow us to track your use of our Site and related functionalities. Cookies and web beacons allow Stanford to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our Site. Cookies and web beacons are not used to retain Personally Identifiable Information. From time to time Stanford may also use additional methods of collecting data. Stanford does not provide any data collected through cookies to third parties.

You should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. Most browsers offer instructions, in the “Help” section of the toolbar, on how to reset the browser to reject cookies. If you reject our cookies, many functions and conveniences of this Site may not work properly.

Personally Identifiable Information. This Privacy Policy serves as notice that Stanford collects Personally Identifiable Information in the manner described herein. Such information may include but is not limited to: username, email address, home address, postal code, gender and year of birth. Stanford collects Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us when you sign-up for email updates, participate in online courses or services through our Site, participate in our public forums, send us email messages, and/or or otherwise contact us. In order to subscribe to services, you may be required to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your user name, name, postal address, and email address. You may also be asked to provide demographic information such as date of birth, gender and educational and vocational information. Stanford may also receive Personally Identifiable Information when you access or log-in to a third party site, e.g., Facebook, from our Site. This may include the text and/or images of your Personally Identifiable Information available from the third party site. Personally Identifiable Information shall not include any information posted or sent by or to you via any public forum.

## Collection of Information by Third Parties

We may permit a limited number of authorized third parties, such as analytics partners, to place cookies through the Site to provide us with better insights into the use of the Site or user demographics. These third parties may collect information, including non-personal information, about a consumer’s online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our website.

## Do Not Track

We do not use technology that recognizes a “do-not-track” signal from your web browser.

## How We Use and Share the Information
