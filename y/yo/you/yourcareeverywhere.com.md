# Privacy Policy | YourCareEverywhere

YourCareEverywhere (“YCE”), a division of MEDHOST Cloud Services, Inc., takes your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy will tell you what information we collect from you and about your use of the site. Except where noted, the Privacy Policy applies to all YCE affiliated web sites, and includes all tools and services offered therein, including the YCE Personal Health Record (“PHR”).  The YCE PHR allows you to collect, manage, and share your health information. If you have registered to access your patient record via a patient portal through your healthcare provider, the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy associated with those records will govern your use and access of any such portal content (even if accessed within the YCE site).

## Information You Give Us

By using the functions of the YCE website, you may be asked to provide YCE with data or information about yourself. Any such information retained by YCE will be considered “Personal Information.”  If you choose to register with YCE, you will be asked to enter certain information, such as your name, address, phone number, and email address (“Registration Information”). Such Registration Information will be treated as Personal Information. Some tools and services, including the YCE PHR, permit you to provide information about your health and/or wellness, which is also considered Personal Information.

You will also be asked to select a YCE Community Sponsor, which is a YCE healthcare customer that purchases products and services from YCE. If there is not a YCE Community Sponsor located near you based on the zip code you enter during registration, then the default YCE Community Sponsor will be YCE. If at any time a YCE Community Sponsor becomes available in your area, YCE reserves to right to select them as your YCE Community Sponsor.  Your YCE Community Sponsor may be provided with your registration information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address so that they may contact you.
