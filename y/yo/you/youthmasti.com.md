#### Uses

If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the Media3K Sites, we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the general and personalized features and functionality of the Media3K Sites, and to process any flagging activity or correspondence you send to us.

Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload content or send messages through the Media3K Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments.

We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Media3K Site changes or for customer service purposes).

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Media3K Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, analyzing, and processing user preferences and trends, as well as user activity and communications.

The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your personal information associated with them.

#### Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites

Media3K allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Media3K Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Media3K Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

Media3K does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Media3K to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Media3K Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Media3K’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
