# ycb.me: Privacy

This page gives you information about the YouCanBook.Me privacy policies.

### What information do we gather?

While Google handle the normal login and authorisation process, we do request from them to be supplied with your email address. 

After we have set up your account and you begin to configure and use the service, we gather two kinds of information: 

  * We store your preferences about how you want your booking process to work, for example the text of any email you would like us to send out when people make new bookings. You can see all this information at any time as it is all visible on your calendar settings pages. 
  * As we take bookings from your users, they complete a booking form answering any of the questions that you wish to ask. You have complete control over what these questions are. We gather the corresponding data, forward it to you by email, add it to your Google calendar and also retain a copy on our servers. 



### Why do we need this information?

Your email address is required for uniquely identifying your account. We also need this to contact you for example to allow you to reset your password. 

  * The basic settings and preferences information is used to manage your booking process. 
  * This information that your users complete on the booking process is retained by us (for a limited time) in order to manage the latter parts of the booking process. For example, the reminder email we send out can be personalised with the information they provided. 



### Disclosure to third parties.

We will not sell any of your information to third parties. 

On the rare occasions we would share your information with third parties, our policy is to limit this to doing so for reasons that would be to your benefit, rather than ours. Here are some examples of when this could happen: 

  * All your booking data will be passed to Google via their calendar API, for them to add this information to your schedule. 
  * If you choose to upgrade to one of our paid for services, we might forward your email address to our payment partners to help identify the transaction. 



### Tracking Technologies

Like many websites and online services, we track usage of our web pages using cookies. This happens via the Google Analytics tool. This allows us to work on improving the application for all our users. 

If you would prefer not to be included in this process, you are able to deactivate the use of cookies within your browser. Our system will continue to work without cookies enabled.
