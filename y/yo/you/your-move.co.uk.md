### In what circumstances will your special data and criminal disclosures be collected?

We may have collected personal information from you which is of a sensitive nature. Where we have done so we treat this information in accordance with the additional protection it is given under data protection laws. Where you have asked us to help you with your insurance needs, in particular life insurance and insurance that may assist you in the event of an accident or illness, we will ask you information about your ethnic origin, your health and medical history (including the health and medical history of your family where appropriate) ( **Special Data** ). We record and use your Special Data in order to meet any obligation we may have to progress your transaction to completion including dealing with any enquiries of us that may be raised by your prospective insurance provider.

If you have parental responsibility for children under the age of 16 and discussion has been had with you in relation to those children during the course of providing financial advice to you it is also very likely that we (and consequently Our Network) will record information on our systems that relates to those children and potentially, to their Special Data.

The arrangement of certain types of insurance may have involved disclosure by you to us of information relating to historic or current criminal convictions or offences (together **Criminal Disclosures** ). This is relevant to insurance related activities such as underwriting, claims and fraud management.

When we process your Special Data and any Criminal Disclosures we do so on the basis that it is in the substantial public interest to be able to provide vital insurance products as permitted by UK data protection related laws and regulations from time to time. Information on Special Data and Criminal Disclosures must be capable of being exchanged freely between insurance intermediaries such as us and insurance providers, to enable customers to secure the important insurance protection that they require.

We and Our Estate Agents use the information you provide us with to keep you informed about products or services which we and Our Estate Agents provide and which we believe you may be interested in. Where we and Our Estate Agents conduct marketing we do so in accordance with applicable laws.

Where you contact us through the 'contact' page of Our Site, or make an enquiry in branch or on the phone to us or one of Our Estate Agents, we and Our Estate Agents will use the details you have supplied to us to provide you with our general property marketing by email unless you choose to 'opt-out' of these communications.
