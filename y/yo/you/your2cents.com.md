**PRIVACY/SECURITY COMMITMENT**

Your2Cents ™ is a professional marketing research company that maintains a panel specializing in the interest and lifestyles of household members in the U.S. and Canada. Your identity and the replies you give to us will remain confidential and private. The following are the guidelines we commit to follow:

Use of Data  
Legal Disclaimer  
Security

**No Solicitation Promise**  
All responses are held in aggregate and individual responses will never be used for advertising or selling purposes. You are not responsible for buying any product or service at any time, nor will any company solicit panel members as a result of joining the Your2Cents.com Opinion Survey Panel.

**Personal Information/Children Under 13**  
The profile survey asks questions about the respondent and his/her household members. Questions such as day of birth, gender, interest, hobbies, and employment are for sake of targeting demographic criteria to match you with the right type of surveys. We ask that you provide information about members in your household to get an accurate update on your total household characteristics. Your e-mail address will only be used to notify you of upcoming survey opportunities. Your name, address, city, state, and zip code are used to geographically identify panel members and to send winners of our cash drawings their winning check by postal mail. Children under the age of 13 years will never be asked to participate in surveys, unless permission is granted by the parent/guardian. Respondents will not be allowed to complete the profile questionnaire if they are a child aged 12 or younger.

**Where Data is Stored**  
Your response data is stored in our secured server that allows only Your2Cents.com to call upon those panelists who match specific criteria to participate in surveys. This query is completely automated and panelist will be contacted via e-mail by Your2Cents.com to participate in our secure surveys.

**Membership Update and Services**  
We provide all panelists the option of opting-out of the panel quickly and easily. Removal is permanent and all information given to us in the profile questionnaire will be erased within our database. The area were panelists can opt-out or be removed from the Your2Cents.com panel is in the [ Membership Update](http://www.common-knowledge.net/your2cents/member_updates.asp?name=) page. Panelist must provide their Panelist ID given to them when they completed the profile survey and their e-mail address for added security. If panelist do not have their Panelist ID, then they should complete the password lookup form by entering in their e-mail address, and Your2Cents.com will send you an e-mail with your password.

We also provide an area designed to update and delete e-mail address when necessary.  Your2Cents.com will automatically remove and update this request  and the panelist will receive confirmation of the deletion or update.

**Monthly sweepstakes cash drawing**  
Our monthly sweepstakes takes place in the first week of every month. Panel members will be randomly selected to win cash even if they have not been invited to participate in a survey that month.  Winners are notified via e-mail of their winnings and they will be sent a check in the amount rewarded within 1-2 weeks after the names are selected. Our [ winners](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603004808id_/http%3A//www.your2cents.com/winnings.asp?name=) page displays the name and city, state were winners came from, but names are only displayed with the direct permission of panelist.

**Use of Data**  
Our number one priority is maintaining the privacy of all information and not to release any one individual’s information separate from the panel. All information will be analyzed in aggregate and grouped in categories. We promise to follow our privacy commitment to our panelists.
