<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sparkart Group, Inc. (“Sparkart”) cares deeply about your privacy and the protection of your personal information, and we have devised this Privacy Policy so you are informed about the collection, use, limited disclosure, and protection of your personal information. By using the Sparkart Services, you consent to the data practices described in this policy statement. Defined terms designated in the Terms of Service shall have the same definitions in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3 id="collection-of-information">Collection Of Information</h3>

<p>When you register for the Sparkart Services, you may be asked to provide certain personal information that may be stored as part of your registration data. The registration data contains various personal information which may include, but not be limited to, the following:  email address, first and last name, country or region, state or territory, city, zip code or postal code, street address, time zone, gender, language, birth date and age, and occupation. In addition to the above information, Sparkart may also collect and store the IP address of your computer or other networking device, which may be needed to operate various features and functionality of the Sparkart Services. We may also collect data pertaining to your online transactions, purchase history, and Sparkart Site and Sparkart Services usage patterns. Further, when you register for the Sparkart Services, you may be asked to create a password for your account. You may also be requested to provide secret questions and secret answers. You use your secret questions and answers, if applicable, to help verify your identity to Sparkart when there are account issues, such as needing to reset your password. You may also be requested to answer various questions and/or surveys about your consumer preferences or other information. Sparkart may store the information described in this paragraph. However, Sparkart does not store your credit card information, which you may be asked to provide when making a purchase.</p>

<h3 id="use-of-your-personal-information">Use Of Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>Sparkart uses your personal information for the operation and maintenance of your Sparkart account and the Sparkart Services. For example, we may use your email address to send you a welcome email message when you first register informing you about the service and telling you how to manage your Sparkart account. You may be required to respond to this email in order to validate that you are the owner of the email address associated with the Sparkart account. If applicable, failure to respond to the email and verify the address within the time stated in the email will cause the Sparkart account to become inactive. This process is designed to verify the validity of the email address and to help prevent email addresses from being used without permission in the creation of Sparkart accounts.</p>

<p>As part of the Sparkart Services, we may recommend for your consideration various services, products and merchandise. Accordingly, we may analyze data pertaining to your online transactions, purchase history, and Sparkart Site and Sparkart Services usage patterns so that we can make recommendations suited especially to you.  </p>

<p>We may also send you email about periodic service updates, recommended security updates, or surveys related to the Sparkart Services or other matters. These periodic emails are considered essential to the provision of the service you have requested. You cannot unsubscribe from these mailings. You may, however, choose not to participate in the surveys.</p>

<h3 id="disclosure-of-personal-information">Disclosure Of Personal Information</h3>

<p>Sparkart may provide your personal information to the third party for whom we operate this Sparkart Site or Sparkart Service (that is, the person, company, entity or organization behind the recording artist, performer, sports star, public figure, celebrity, music festival, event, apparel brand, retailer, entertainment brand, or other person or company for whom we operate the site, sell merchandise, or provide other services). Please be aware that these third parties may have their own policies governing how they will use and disclose your personal information that may be different from this Privacy Policy. 
Sparkart occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf or to fulfill a service or transaction you may have requested, such as answering customer support inquiries, fulfilling merchandise orders, credit card payment processing, selling concert tickets, etc. Sparkart will only provide these companies with those pieces of your personal information needed to deliver the services.</p>

<p>Sparkart may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on Sparkart; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Sparkart; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Sparkart Service, or the public.</p>

<p>Sparkart may transfer personal information collected and assign the entirety of its rights and obligations under this Privacy Policy in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets associated with the Sparkart Services. </p>

<p>Sparkart may share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Sparkart when we have your consent to do so. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive communications or services from a third party, your information may be subject to the third party’s privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. </p>

<h3 id="managing-your-personal-information">Managing Your Personal Information</h3>

<h3 id="you-sharing-your-information">You Sharing Your Information</h3>

<p>If you choose, you may opt-in to various features which may be available as part of the Sparkart Services which allow you to voluntarily share information, whether to a group of Sparkart users designated by you (for example, a “buddy list” or “friends” who also have a registered account) or to everyone (for example, when you post user generated content to a publicly accessible area on a website). You are cautioned not to post your personal information in the interest of safety, privacy and security. You should not post your address, telephone number, or anything that might put you at risk. Sparkart is not responsible for monitoring this information, and Sparkart is not liable for any consequences that may result from the exchange of this information. </p>

<h3 id="security-and-storage-of-your-personal-information">Security And Storage Of Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>Sparkart is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access and located in controlled facilities. </p>

<p>You must type the correct password to access your information. It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your Sparkart account password and not to reveal this information to others.</p>

By using the Sparkart Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. </p>

<h3 id="operational-information">Operational Information</h3>

<p>Some “operational” information is used by Sparkart in order to operate your account properly and provide the Sparkart Services. This operational information does not include the personal information that you provide as part of your Sparkart registration data, but may include, for example, the following:  the date on which your registration data was last updated, whether your email address has been verified, whether your account has been deactivated, what browser you are using, the IP address of your computer or other networking device, and other similar types of information.  Operational information may be shared with third parties to the extent necessary to provide the Sparkart Services.</p>

<h3 id="aggregate-information">Aggregate Information</h3>

<p>We may collect and analyze information about your use of the Sparkart Services as aggregated with the use of the Sparkart Services by other users (“Aggregate Information”); for example, overall usage patterns of Sparkart users, the total number of Sparkart users, the percentage of Sparkart users who are female, or in a certain age range, or who live in a particular region, etc., or the percentage of Sparkart users who are also consumers of various other products and services. The collection and analysis of Aggregate Information is important in the operation and enhancement of the Sparkart Services and other business purposes. Aggregate Information may be compiled in reports and disclosed, sold, licensed or rented to third parties. However, since Aggregate Information does not include any information that can be used to individually identify you or any other Sparkart user, it is not possible for the third party recipient of the Aggregate Information to use it to identify or contact you.</p>

<p>This Sparkart Site or Service may use a third party web analytics service. Sparkart and/or such third party analytics company may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as any text you type in this Sparkart Site or Service.
