**Our Commitment to Privacy:**

YourBizWebsites and Automated Income Stream Ltd is dedicated to keeping your private information safe and secure. For your information and security, please take note of our policies and procedures as it pertains to your information and its use.

**Personally Identifiable Information:**

Upon enrolment we collect and store Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as: name, address, phone, and email address. This information is used to send your login details, password reminders, newsletters, and special event announcements. Your information will not be used for SPAM. Credit card and all membership and payment information is encrypted.

**Contact Rights:**

As a member of "YourBizWebsites" you will receive updates, news and special offers from our training program and our affiliates. All parties privy to PII are required to protect it according to this privacy policy and the CAN-SPAM act. We never use or share PII in ways unrelated to the above described without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or prohibit such unrelated use.

**Data Security:**

To prevent data theft or unauthorized use, and ensure proper data storage procedures, we have put into place cutting edge encryption and server equipment and management to safeguard and secure all data and PII. Automated Income Streams Ltd is a Data Protection registered company.

If you are purchasing something from YourBizWebsites/Automated Income Stream Ltd, we, and any third party provider, need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us, or third party providers, to process and fulfil your order and to notify you of your order status. Credit card and e-mail information will not be shared or sold to third parties for any purpose except as provided in this Privacy Policy without your express permission.

When you sign up for a YourBizWebsites.com e-mail service, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for targeted third-party e-mail lists. Whether or not you want to receive these announcements is your choice. If you choose to receive an announcement from a specific distribution list, you can unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions on the e-mails you receive.

We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new products and services. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive postal mailings from Automated Income Stream Ltd or third party companies. 

**How do you use single-pixel gifs?**

YourBizWebsites.com and its advertisers may use single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web beacons, to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical information. YourBizWebsites.com does not gather personal information through the use of these images. Our advertisers may use single-pixel gifs that can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user's computer by an advertiser.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

**Additional Security:**

Certain Automated Income Stream Ltd media properties use a shopping cart feature that safeguards this information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other Automated Income Stream Ltd media properties do not use SSL and thereby do not offer a secure coded way to transfer information.

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

**Your Consent To This Agreement:**

By using the YourBizWebsites.com subscription form, you consent to the collection and use of information by Automated Income Stream Ltd as specified above. We reserve the right to modify this Policy. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
