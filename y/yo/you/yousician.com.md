### WHAT DATA WE COLLECT AND WHY

We do not collect any personal information unless we need it for a specific reason. Here we have listed the data we collect for your reference.

##### Data you give us:

When you sign up for the Service, we ask for your username, password and email address. We need this data to identify you and to operate and provide the Service for you, and also to send you important messages about your account and the Service. We also use your e-mail address to send you also other kinds of messages, like reports, surveys and offers that you are free to opt in or out from via the privacy section of the Yousician application menu. If you choose to, you can also give us additional information, like your real name or profile picture, to make your social experience better, but this is totally optional. We collect the content you provide to us when you use our Service. If you enroll to our Service as a teacher use, we also ask for your school name to make sure it’s a real place of education.

If you are in touch with our support agents about resolving issues in the Service or any other issues, we keep the information about your interactions with us to help us provide a better service. We also store all messages sent to our forums to help users find useful information about the Service.

Your payment data is needed to process the billing of your Service subscriptions and other purchases you make.

Sometimes, if we run special campaigns or sweepstakes, like giving out instruments, we may need some additional information from you, such as an address where we can ship the instrument. In these cases, we provide more details to you about why we are collecting the data and how we use it.

##### Data we receive from our partners:

If you decide to log in to our Service with Facebook, we receive from Facebook your Facebook username, real name, e-mail address and profile picture. We use those for the same purposes as when you give them to us directly. We also get your list of friends from Facebook, which we use to connect you with your friends who already use our Service.We may also receive personal information from our advertising and analytics partners, so that we are able to provide you a better Service.

##### Some data is collected automatically when you use the Service:

We use your IP address to bring our product to your device, but also to get an idea of your general location through IP geolocation data (on city and country level). We use this so that we can manage the content available in the Service in your territory or to show you pricing in your own currency and also to analyse our Service and its usage. Your mobile device identifiers, such as your device ID are collected e.g. for making sure the product displays correctly and performs optimally on your device. We may also collect automatically other data of your device (such as your device type, device’s operating system or browser type and version), or device identifiers (such as your advertising ID,).Your gameplay data and analytics about your use of our Services (e.g. progress, songs played, levels, session length, how you were referred to our Services), and interactions in the Service (such as data on or purchases you make or content you choose to share) are also stored automatically.

### YOUSICIAN’S PARTNERS

Instead of doing absolutely everything on our own, we have partners that provide services and data processing for us. We have listed the type of partners we use:

We use hosting providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store and deliver our content. These people don’t have access to the data itself but provide the infrastructure we need to provide our services.

Our customer service uses platforms like Zendesk as a tool to provide the best support possible for our users.

Services like MailChimp help us make sure we send the right messages to the right people and only the types of messages you want to receive.

AppsFlyer we use to determine how you learned about us and our Service, and how we can improve our user acquisition.

We use partners and their technologies for our online advertising outside the Services. We run certain analytics ourselves, but we also use partners and their tools for running analytics. The Service includes social media interaction tools provided by our partners. These partners may provide us some data e.g. if you decide to link third party tool to the Service (such as Facebook login) or decide to share content from our Service in social media. These partners may access and collect some of your data and some of them operate under their own privacy policies, which we urge you to check to learn how they use your data. Please check [here for more information](https://yousician.com/privacy-notice-third-party).

Payment partners are the parties who actually process the billing for the Service and deal with banks and credit card companies on our behalf. As this is a big responsibility, we only use trusted, PCI-DSS certified partners.

We also share data with our subsidiaries and affiliates in other countries, like YS North America, which legally and technically are separate entities, although we are all the same group of companies. We may also share information to subsequent owners or their advisors in connection with a corporate merger or other corporate reorganization or a similar arrangement.

If we need to combat fraud or illegal activity, we may exchange data with other companies and organizations. We may also provide data to authorities to respond to their lawful requests.

Users can adjust their browser settings to disable cookies or to delete cookies that have been saved in the browser, but this can result some parts of the Service not functioning properly.
