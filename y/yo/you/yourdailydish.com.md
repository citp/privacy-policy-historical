# Privacy Policy - Your Daily Dish

YourDailyDish (“YourDailyDish,” “Us,” “Our” or “We”) is committed to protecting Your privacy online. This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the website at www.yourdailydish.com and various related services (together referred to as the “Site”). All visitors to, or users of, the Site are referred to individually, as “You” or “Your.” 

You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of Our Site Terms of Service, available at www.yourdailydish.com/terms, and by accessing or using Our Site, You agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. The Terms of Service establishes the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of Our Site. **If You do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use this Site.**

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, We will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes, if You have provided Us with Your email). If the Site allows You to be a registered user, You acknowledge and agree that it is Your responsibility to maintain a valid email address as a registered user, review this Site and this Privacy Policy periodically and to be aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site after such modifications will constitute Your: (a) acknowledgment of the modified Privacy Policy; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.

Capitalized terms contained herein have the same meaning as in the Terms of Service, unless defined differently in this Privacy Policy.

**Types of Information Collected**

In order to better provide You with Our Site, We collect two types of information about Our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from You is to provide You with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using Our Site.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that lets Us know the specifics of who You are. When You engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering for an account, ordering a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, or sending Us feedback, We may ask You to provide certain information about You by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for You to engage in these activities. If You elect to engage in these activities, however, We may ask that You provide Us with Personally Identifiable Information, such as Your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, employer, job title and department, birth date, age, gender, telephone and facsimile numbers, short message service (SMS) or text message address or other wireless device address, and other personal identifying information. In addition, We may collect certain other Personally Identifiable Information, including Your IP address when You use Our Site. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about You based upon where You visit on Our Site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both an individual and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website that You just came from, which URL You next go to, what browser You are using, the type of operating system You have.

**Collection Methods and Use of Information**

You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to Us when You: (a) register for Our Services and register Your email address with Us or (b) send email messages, submit forms, submit comments or rankings, or transmit other information by telephone or letter. We may also collect information from You at other points on Our Site.

In addition, We may also collect, or Our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use Your IP address to diagnose problems with Our servers, software, to administer Our Site. Our third party ad servers will also provide Us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell Us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at Our Site. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze usage of the Site, Services, promotions and online media, as well as to offer You targeted products and services. We also reserve the right to use aggregate or group data about Our visitors for any other lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage and/or characteristics of Our visitors as a group. By visiting, and/or supplying Your Personally Identifiable Information via the Site and other online media, You agree to allow Us to provide such aggregate data to any third parties at Our discretion, as lawfully permitted.

We will primarily use Your Personally Identifiable Information to provide Our Services to You, as required by Our agreements with You. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation of Our Site, fill orders, improve Our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve Our product and service offerings, and customize Our Site’s content, layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to You and to contact You regarding administrative notices. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce Our agreements with You, including Our Site Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.

We do not use automatic decision-making (i.e., making decisions solely by automated means without any human involvement) or profiling (i.e., automated processing of Personally Identifiable Information to evaluate certain aspects of an individual). 

Where We intend to process Your information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was collected, We will provide You with information regarding the purpose for the processing, as well as other relevant information, prior to processing Your information for the new purpose.

**Release of Information and Opt-Out**

We reserve the right to share the postal addresses, phone numbers or email addresses of users with third parties, such as advertisers. To prevent Us from sharing this information in the future, please email Us at: [admin@yourdailydish.com](mailto:admin@yourdailydish.com). We will not share users’ credit card numbers. Occasionally, We send e-mail messages to users to inform them of features and services available on Our Sites.

Occasionally We may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use Our Services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that We in good faith believe to be unlawful.

We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about Our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when You visit Our Site. These companies may use information (not including Your name, address, email address or telephone number) about Your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to You. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. 

YourDailyDish adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles in connection with this interest-based advertising activity.  You may visit www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program.  If You delete Your cookies or use a different browser or mobile device, You may need to renew Your opt-out choices exercised through the DAA tool.  Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in Your browser or applications.  It may make the ads You see less relevant to Your interests.  Additionally, Your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies; however, if You use these tools, Our Site may not function as intended.

We may also work with third parties that collect data about Your use of the Site and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes.  YourDailyDish uses Google Analytics and other third-party services to improve the performance of the Site and for analytics and marketing purposes.  For more information about how Google Analytics collects and uses data when You use Our Site, visit [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), and to opt out of Google Analytics, visit [tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).
