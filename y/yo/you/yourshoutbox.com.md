**Privacy Policy**

**General**

  1. At Your Shoutbox, we take the privacy of our users, members and customers seriously. This policy covers how we deal with email addresses and other personal information collected. 
  2. This privacy policy ONLY applies to Your Shoutbox, the Your Shoutbox website, and the information we collect on registration or use of a shoutbox. 



**Children**

  1. Due to strict laws on collecting personal information from children, nobody under the age of 13 may register for a shoutbox or use a shoutbox on a site they own or run, whether in part or in whole. 
  2. Young people between the age of 13 and 18 may own a shoutbox provided they have parental permission to do so. We take this on trust: by signing up for a shoutbox you agree that you do have parental permission if neccessary as determined by your age. 



**Personal Details**

  1. Registration for a shoutbox requires a few details about yourself, including (but not limited to) a valid email address. We promise these will never knowingly be released, given, traded or sold to anyone outside of Your Shoutbox staff. 
  2. The Your Shoutbox staff will never use the information you provide for anything other than shoutbox business unless you request or allow us to do so. 
  3. Should we find you, your shoutbox, or your website to be breaking the law in a serious manner, we reserve the right to pass information on to legal authorities as requested. 
  4. Information will also be released on receipt of a subpoena, court order, or other legal action. 



**Cookies**

  1. Your Shoutbox may set one or more cookies on your computer or on the computer of anyone using a shoutbox. We guarantee these cookies will not be for anything more than remembering sign-in details, usernames, or tracking hits. You may block or remove these cookies from your computer if you wish, but please be aware that non-acceptance of the Your Shoutbox login cookie will deny you access to your admin panel. 



**Account Changes**

  1. You may change your account details at any time through the admin area of your shoutbox. The privacy policy is applicable for both past and present information entered. 
  2. If you request removal of your account or deletion of your shoutbox, your details will be removed from the server. 
  3. If a shoutbox is removed by any of the Your Shoutbox staff for violation of our Terms of Service, we may keep details on record in case of future legal action. 
  4. Any changes to your personal details (such as new email address) should be changed by you through the admin area of your shoutbox to allow us to update our records. 



**Emails and Global Contact**

  1. Your Shoutbox may occasionally contact all users regarding updates, any planned downtime, or any other shoutbox related information. 
  2. Your Shoutbox may occasionally contact all users via a global shout posted across all shouotbox accounts. These are not optional, but may be deleted on individual accounts at any time after posting by the admin of that shoutbox. 
  3. Your Shoutbox may occasionally contact all users with commercial solicitations, third party solicitations, or any other information we deem appropriate. All such emails will include a link allowing you to remove yourself from our servers if you no longer wish to get our emails. 



**Terms of Service**
