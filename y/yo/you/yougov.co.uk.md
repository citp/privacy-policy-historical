The [www.yougov.co.uk ](https://yougov.co.uk/)website (the "Website") is owner, operated and provided by YouGov Plc (a company registered in England and Wales with company number 03607311 whose registered office is at 50 Featherstone Street, London, EC1Y 8RT, United Kingdom) and its group companies (hereafter collectively referred to as "YouGov", “we” or “us”).

Use of the Website and any YouGov extranet sites to which you may be directed (together the "YouGov WebPages") and membership of all panels set up and administered by YouGov (the "YouGov Panels") or participation in any other YouGov research activities ("YouGov Activities") is governed by these terms and conditions of use (the "Terms").

* * *

**1\. Acknowledgement and Acceptance**

1.1.         By ticking 'I agree' during the process to register participation as a member of a YouGov Panel ("Member"), or by participating in a YouGov Activity or by simply accessing and using the YouGov WebPages, you agree to be bound by these Terms including the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy incorporated herein by reference. Should you not wish to accept these Terms, you must exit the YouGov WebPages immediately and/or or cease participation in any YouGov Panels or YouGov Activities.

1.2.         YouGov reserves the right at any time and from time to time, to modify or amend these Terms or any part thereof, without reasonable notice to you. Your continued use of the YouGov WebPages or continued participation in the YouGov Panels or the YouGov Activities constitute an affirmative acknowledgement of any modification and your continued agreement to be bound by the modified Terms.

* * *

**2\. Terms of Participation**

2.1.         **YouGov Member Registration Process**

2.1.1.         To become a Member and to participate in a YouGov Panel, you need to register with YouGov and create a Panel Membership Profile following the registration process set out below (the "YouGov Registration Process").

2.1.2.         Prospective Members must complete a YouGov registration form each time they wish to join a YouGov Panel. Registration forms include:

2.1.2.1.      The form available on the Website, but may also include permission-based registration forms hosted on third party websites;

2.1.2.2.      Registration forms hosted by YouGov and accessed via third party websites; or

2.1.2.3.      Registration forms accessed via links in an email sent to you by a third party or by YouGov where you have granted permission to receive such emails from these sources.

2.1.3.         The registration form may include any number of questions or may be limited solely to the expression of assent to join the YouGov Panel.

2.1.4.         During each YouGov Registration Process prospective Members will be notified of any terms in addition to these Terms which shall apply to membership of the respective YouGov Panel.

2.1.5.         You have to be 16 years or older to join the panel. 

2.2.         **Undertaking regarding information provided**

2.2.1.         In consideration of YouGov granting you access to the WebPages and/or the ability to participate in a YouGov Panel or YouGov Activity, you agree to:

2.2.1.1.      Provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the YouGov Registration Process;

2.2.1.2.      Maintain and promptly update your personal membership details including the Panel Membership Profile (defined below) so as to keep it true, accurate, current and complete; and

2.2.1.3.      Provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by YouGov whilst participating in a YouGov Panel or YouGov Activity.

2.2.2.         If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or YouGov has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, YouGov has the right to suspend or terminate your current access to, use of, and/or participation in YouGov Panels or YouGov Activities. This is subject to your right to refuse to answer any Panels or YouGov survey or information request.

2.3.         **Your Panel Membership Profile and YouGov Account**

2.3.1.         Upon completing the YouGov Registration Process, Members will be provided with a profile ("Panel Membership Profile") and an account ("YouGov Account") for those YouGov Panels and YouGov Activities (related to a particular YouGov Panel) for which Credit (as defined below) is awarded.

2.3.2.         Only one Panel Membership Profile is permitted per Member for each YouGov Panel and only one YouGov Account is permitted per Member for each YouGov Panel for which Credit is awarded. Any Member found to have multiple Panel Membership Profiles and/or YouGov Accounts may have secondary Panel Membership Profiles and/or YouGov Accounts deleted. Credit accrued in secondary YouGov Accounts may not be transferred. YouGov may demand proof of identity in the event of a dispute.

2.3.3.         A unique email address must be used by each Member. (For example, this means that family members may not each have an account using a shared email address but must each have a separate account with a separate email address.)

2.3.4.         Each Panel Membership Profile and YouGov Account must only be accessed by an individual Member, and may not be accessed by any other individual without the express permission and authorisation of YouGov. You agree to notify YouGov immediately you become aware of, or suspect any unauthorised use of your login information, Panel Membership Profile and/or YouGov Account, or any other breach of security.

2.3.5.         In the event of access to your YouGov Account by another individual, YouGov reserves the right to freeze the account until a resolution has been reached. YouGov reserves the right to reclaim any incentive earned by access of the unauthorised user, for which the Member will have no recourse against YouGov.

2.3.6.         Members may accrue credits for their YouGov Account ("Credit") in the prescribed manner detailed on the YouGov WebPages, including for completing the YouGov Registration Process and for participating in YouGov Panels and related YouGov Activities for which Credit is awarded. The amount of Credit accrued for participation in a YouGov Panel or related YouGov Activity will be notified to Members via authorised communications.

2.3.7.         Unless otherwise specifically notified, Credit can only be earned through following all and any instructions regarding earning Credit. A Member's failure to correctly follow any required instructions or procedures may result in no Credit being earned, for which the Member will have no recourse against YouGov.

2.3.8.         Credit earned will be recorded in your YouGov Account, however no Credit earned is ever available for redemption until the Member has (subject to paragraph 2.3.9 below) reached the specified fulfilment level notified to the Member when completing the respective YouGov Registration Process.

2.3.9.         YouGov reserves the right to change the range of YouGov Activities and YouGov Panels or related YouGov Activities through which Credit may be accrued and to vary the frequency of invitation to such activities and panels. YouGov also reserves the right to alter the level of Credit required before such Credit can be redeemed.

2.3.10.     Credit may not be transferred to other YouGov Accounts nor pooled together in any manner and the sale or barter of Credit is strictly prohibited. Credit has no monetary value, and cannot be used for any purpose other than redeeming the designated reward.

2.3.11.     YouGov may from time to time adjust a Member's YouGov Account upwards or downwards in response to errors which Members acknowledge may arise or suspected fraud, for which we have full authority.

2.3.12.     YouGov reserves the right to terminate any YouGov Account that has been dormant for a period of 6 months or more. By ‘dormant’ we mean, where the Member has not participated in the relevant YouGov Panel or related YouGov Activity within the preceding 6 month period. YouGov will attempt to contact the Member, via their nominated email address, if their YouGov Account is at risk of termination through inactivity. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the YouGov Account will be terminated, and any accrued Credit will be forfeited.

  **3\. Prize polls**

3.1.         YouGov may ask you to participate in YouGov Activities which will enter you into a prize draw. Such draws will be governed by the respective terms and conditions specified and displayed for each prize draw.

**4\. Referral Links**

4.1.         You may be able to earn extra Credit by referring friends and family to the YouGov panel, provided they join using your unique Referral Link. The conditions attached to the awarding of such extra Credit are explained in the Account section of the website. When referring new panel members, you agree to not pose as or claim to represent YouGov and you will not attempt to mislead or deceive prospective members into using your Referral Link to join. You agree to clear to any prospective members you refer that they will be using your unique Referral Link and that you will receive Credit if they join the YouGov panel via your Referral Link.

**5\. User Content**

5.1.         Use of the YouGov WebPages and participation in YouGov Activities or YouGov Panels may allow you to interact with, or submit content to, the YouGov WebPages which may be visible to other users of the YouGov WebPages ("User Content").

5.2.         You acknowledge that User Content provided by you is your sole responsibility. This means that you, and not YouGov, are entirely responsible for all User Content you upload, post, link to, email or otherwise transmit via your use of the YouGov WebPages or your participation in any of the YouGov Activities or YouGov Panels.

5.3.         YouGov does not control or pre-screen the User Content posted on the WebPages and does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such User Content, and therefore assumes no liability in respect of the User Content.

5.4.         You understand that by using the YouGov WebPages, you may be exposed to User Content, and you agree that you must evaluate, and bear, all risks associated with the use of any User Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness, or usefulness. Notwithstanding the foregoing YouGov shall have the right in their sole discretion to refuse, edit, move or remove any such User Content, whether or not it violates these Terms.

5.5.         With respect to all User Content you elect to transmit to the YouGov WebPages, you grant YouGov the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive licence (with the right to sublicense) to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, translate, create derivative works from, perform and display such User Content (in whole or part) throughout the world and / or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known or later developed, for any purposes.

5.6.         In the course of using the YouGov WebPages and / or participating in YouGov Activities or YouGov Panels, you agree not to:

5.6.1.         Upload, post, link to, email or otherwise transmit any information that is unlawful in any way in the United Kingdom, or in the country in which you reside;

5.6.2.         Impersonate any person (whether living or dead) or entity;

5.6.3.         Forge headers or otherwise manipulate identities in order to disguise the origin of any content transmitted through the YouGov WebPages or provided through participation in YouGov Activities or YouGov Panels;

5.6.4.         Upload, post, link to, or otherwise transmit any information that you do not have a right to transmit;

5.6.5.         Upload, post, link to, email or otherwise transmit any unsolicited or unauthorised advertising, promotional materials, "junk mail", "chain letters", "phishing emails", "pyramid schemes", or any other form of solicitation;

5.6.6.         Upload, post, link to, email or otherwise transmit any material that contains software viruses or any other computer, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment;

5.6.7.         Collect or store personal data about other individuals; or

5.6.8.         Attempt to submit more than one vote per survey or do any other act that may affect the validity of any result obtained through any YouGov Activity or YouGov Panel.

**6\. Termination**

6.1.         If you no longer wish to be a Member please contact YouGov. YouGov will then cease to contact you, subject to a 30 day administration period. You therefore acknowledge and agree that if you terminate your membership you may receive emails from YouGov for a period of 30 days thereafter. In terminating membership, any accumulated Credit will be forfeited.

6.2.         You agree that YouGov, in its sole discretion, may terminate or suspend your YouGov Membership, or participation in any YouGov Activities or YouGov Panels, or remove or discard any User Content, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use, or if YouGov believed that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms.

6.3.         You agree that any termination of your access to YouGov Activities or YouGov Panels under any provision of these Terms may be effected without notice, and acknowledge and agree that YouGov may immediately deactivate your registration as a Member and/or bar access to YouGov Activities and YouGov Panels. Further, you agree that YouGov shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the YouGov Activities or YouGov Panels.

6.4.         YouGov reserves the right to terminate the YouGov Panel, or YouGov WebPages at any time. In such a case and unless specified otherwise, no YouGov Account Credit will be redeemable by any members with the exception of those who have reached fulfilment level referred to in section 3.3.8 above. YouGov will endeavour to communicate to all Members the termination period, however YouGov will not be liable for failure to notify any Member regardless of the reasons.

**7\. Indemnity**

7.1.         You hereby agree to indemnify and keep indemnified YouGov, its successors and assignees and each of its respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all liability, damages, losses, claims (including reasonable legal fees) resulting in any way from your use of the YouGov WebPages (including the provision of User Content) or your participation in the YouGov Activities or YouGov Panels or resulting from any breach of this Agreement whether such breach is carried out by you or by any other person through your Panel Membership Profile or YouGov Account.

**8\. Third Party Websites**

8.1.         Links included within the YouGov WebPages may let you leave the YouGov WebPages and enter into other website(s) ("Linked Site(s)"). The Linked Sites are not under the control of YouGov and YouGov is not responsibility and nor shall it be liable for the contents of any Linked Sites or any links contained in a linked site or any changes or updates to such sites. YouGov is not responsible for webcasting or any other form of transmission received from any Linked Site. YouGov is only providing these links to you as a convenience and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by YouGov of the site or any association with their operators.

**9\. Intellectual Property**

9.1.         All pages and content within the YouGov WebPages, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, audio, video, photographs, software, inventions, surveys, logos or other materials (“Materials”) are the intellectual property of, or are authorised for use by, YouGov and its licensors, business partners and affiliates, including all trade marks, service marks, copyrights, patents, database rights and trade secrets contained therein. The compilation, organisation and display of the content as well as all software and inventions used on and in connection with the YouGov WebPages are the exclusive property of YouGov.

10.3.     A waiver by YouGov of any breach by you of any of the provisions of these Terms or the acquiescence of YouGov to any act (whether of commission or omission) which but for such acquiescence would be a breach as aforesaid shall not constitute a general waiver of such provision or of any subsequent act contrary thereto.

1.4  We will process your information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Market Research Society Code of Conduct.

**2\. How will we use your information?**

2.1  We use your information in the following ways:

2.1.2        to analyse the data for research purposes and to incorporate it into our databases for general research and analysis purposes;

2.3  We only keep your information for as long as is necessary.

**3.** **Non-personal information we collect**

3.1 Without registration for a YouGov panel, the only information we may collect is non-personal information through the use of Cookies, web beacons or similar analytics-driven technologies.

3.2 As is true of most digital services, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

  * **Usage and Referral Information** : We also collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our services. This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and so on. Additionally, like most digital services today, we keep digital log files that record data each time a device accesses our servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access. We collect data from the device and application you use to access our services, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address. If you arrive at a YouGov service from an external source (such as a link on another website or contained in an email), we may use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyse trends, administer the site, track users, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
  * **Cookies** : We may use "cookies" to collect the information referred to and track your use of our site. A cookie is a text file containing a small amount of information that is sent to your browser when you visit a website.  The cookie is then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises it. Cookies are an extremely useful technology and do lots of different jobs. We use various types of cookies (including some that we place and others which we permit third parties to place on our site) for a number of purposes. The information collected by Cookies allows us to monitor how many people are using our services and their interactions with other services, how many people open our e-mails, and determine for what purposes these actions are being taken. Cookies are also used to facilitate a user's log-in, as navigation aids, and as session timers, and to restrict underage use of YouGov tools and services. We also use Cookies to match non-personally identifiable information to third-party databases to create anonymized marketing profiles that could result in you seeing customized advertising or content when browsing the internet. We do not link non-personal information from Cookies to personally identifiable information without permission, and we do not use Cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information. If for any reason you do not want us to track your use of our site using cookies, you can opt out of this using your browser settings and can also select the option “Do Not Track” (for more information please refer to your browser). Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. For more information about "cookies", why we use them and how to refuse cookies, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://yougov.co.uk/about/cookies/).
  * **Web Beacons:** We also may use web beacons to collect non-personal information about the use of our services. The information collected by web beacons allows us to monitor how many people are using our services, how many people open our e-mails, and determine for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our web beacons are not used to track activity outside of our services. We do not link non-personal information from web beacons to personally identifiable information without permission and do not use web beacons to collect or store personally identifiable Information.



**4\. Digital tracking and your preferences**

4.1 YouGov takes all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of visitors to our website, but we cannot promise that the current limitations of the software that runs our website will address every browser setting or honour every personal browser preference. As the capabilities of our software improves, we will take all reasonable steps to honour such requests in the future.   Please return to this privacy policy for further updates on this topic.

4.2 Further, our digital media service providers and business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across digital media platforms. We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on other digital media services that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those websites. 

**5\. Communicating with you**

5.1 By becoming a YouGov Member, you agree to allow us to communicate with you via email or sms in relation to your membership of the YouGov panel(s) and opportunities to participate in YouGov activities. These include but are not limited to communications relating to:

  * YouGov polls;
  * YouGov Pulse (our digital monitoring technology);
  * YouGov Online (Opigram) (the interactive element of our websites);
  * other forms of YouGov research;
  * YouGov research results; and
  * YouGov newsletters;



**6\. Where do we transfer your information to?**

6.1  Your information may be accessed and processed by our staff, service providers, affiliates or agents located in any of our offices around the world.

6.2  Please do not send us your information if you do not agree to it being transferred outside the EEA in this way. By providing your information to us you agree and consent to us transferring to, and storing your information in any of our offices around the world. If you do not agree to this then you should unsubscribe from the YouGov panel.

**7\. Who do we share your information with?**

7.1  We may share your information with any companies in our group and other branches of YouGov for internal reporting purposes.

7.2  We may share your information with other organisations:

7.2.1        who provide services to us so that they can provide the services we request. This might include IT service providers who support our IT systems, for example;

7.2.2        who we provide services to so that they can benefit from the services we provide. Whilst we will, where possible, take steps to ensure that you cannot be identified from that information, as we cannot ever fully understand what information our clients may already hold about you, it may be that they can link the anonymous information that we provide, to other information which then enables them to identify you. By way of example:

  * if you have given us your Twitter username we may share tweets posted by you and your followers to third parties and, while we will not disclose your Twitter handle, it may be that either (a) information contained within those feeds alone could identify you or a third party or (b) those tweets could be linked with other information the third party already holds which then enables them to identify you or someone else; or
  * we may exchange what we consider to be anonymous or pseudonymised information about our panellists with third parties who will use it for analysis purposes, to enhance their own databases, to model audiences and track the efficiency of campaigns, and to gain an insight into behaviours so that they can develop strategies which add value to their, or their clients’ businesses. For this purpose, we may also collect anonymised information from third parties which we can use to identify you. As our clients and, in turn their clients, will have their own databases and other sources of information, it may be that they could link the anonymous information we provide with information they already have and therefore identify you; or
  * we may provide limited personal details to trusted third party data processors for the purposes of combining our data with other third party data sources.  The final combined data set will be anonymised and non-attributable. 



7.2.3        if we sell or buy any business or assets, (as we may share your data with the prospective seller or buyer);

7.2.4        if we or substantially all of our company assets are acquired by another party, in which case your information will be one of the transferred assets; or

7.2.5        if we have to share your information to comply with legal or regulatory requirements (or we reasonably believe that we need to disclose your information for such purposes), or if we have to enforce or apply our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://yougov.co.uk/about/terms-conditions/) or any other terms and conditions or agreements or to protect our rights, property or our customers etc.

7.3  Other than as listed above, we will not rent, sell or otherwise disclose your information without your consent.

7.4  Please bear in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal data online - for example on message boards, on a blog or chat area - that information will be viewed by others.

**8\. How do we keep your information secure?**

8.1  All your information is stored on secure servers that are owned or leased by us.

8.2  Any payment transactions will be made via BACS.

8.3  If you have a username, password or other login details which enable you to access certain parts of our site, you must not allow any other person to use them and must treat them as confidential. If you believe or suspect that someone else knows your login details you must contact us at [supportuk@yougov.com](mailto:supportuk@yougov.com) as soon as possible. Please also see our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://yougov.co.uk/about/terms-conditions/).

8.4  Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will apply our normal procedures and comply with legal requirements to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

8.5  Our site may from time to time contain links to and from other websites. If you follow a link to any of those sites, please note that those sites ought to have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those sites or for their privacy policies. Please check those privacy policies before you submit your information to those sites. Please also see our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://yougov.co.uk/about/terms-conditions/) for further provisions relating to other websites.

**9\. Your Rights**

You have the right to access your personal information and should direct any request for your information to us at [supportuk@yougov.com](mailto:supportuk@yougov.com). Please note that a fee of ten pounds (£10.00) may be payable to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you. **** It is also important to note that, while you can request your information at any time, we continuously ask our panellists to update information about themselves and so there will be opportunities to review your details throughout the year.

9.1  Due to the nature of our activities and our need to take a snapshot of views and opinions at a particular moment in time, it is not possible to amend any responses to surveys, focus groups, online forum, YouGov online, YouGov Pulse or tweets which you make (where you have provided your username).

9.2  If you have a complaint about how we have used your information, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office.

**Our use of cookies**

Welcome to [www.yougov.co.uk](https://yougov.co.uk/)(‘the Site’), which is owned and operated by YouGov Plc (a company registered in England and Wales with company number 03607311 whose registered office is at 50 Featherstone Street, London, EC1Y 8RT, United Kingdom) and its group companies (hereafter collectively referred to as "YouGov", “we” or “us”).

Below you will find information on what cookies may be placed on your device when you visit the Site and how to reject or delete those cookies.  For further detailed information about this Site, please click here to see our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://yougov.co.uk/about/terms-conditions/) and our [Privacy Policy](https://yougov.co.uk/about/privacy/).

**By continuing to use this Site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies in the manner described in this policy.**

**1\. What are cookies?**

1.1  A cookie is a small data file that is placed on your computer or other device to allow a website to recognise you as a user when you return to the website using the same computer and web browser, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (a ‘persistent cookie’).  Other similar files work in the same way and we use the word ‘cookie’ in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.

1.2  We will not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you.

**2\. What are cookies used for?**

2.1  Cookies are an extremely common technology for remembering certain information about a visitor to a website.  The vast majority of websites currently make use of cookies and they are commonly used for a wide range of tasks.  We use cookies for the following purposes:

2.1.1        as necessary for website operation, for example to enable you to login to your account or place an order;

2.1.2        to analyse the use of the Site by, for example, recognising and counting the number of visitors and how they move around the Site.  This helps us to see what parts of the site are popular and which sections need improving to make the experience better for users;

2.1.3        to recognise you when you return to the Site so that content can be personalised for you, for example, by remembering your country and site preferences;

2.1.4        to record your visit to the Site and the pages you have visited and links you have followed.  We will use this to make the Site more relevant to your interests;

2.1.5        to monitor, and permit third parties to monitor the effectiveness of advertising campaigns; and

2.1.6        to enable us, and third parties, to create target segments for advertising purposes.

This document gives you information on the specific cookies used on this Site.

**3\. How to control and delete cookies**

3.1  When you accessed the Site, you were presented with a message that notified you of our use of cookies.  We could not have displayed this notice to you without using a cookie (you can see details of this cookie under ‘Cookie Banner’ in the table below). If you continue to use the Site, more cookies and other tracking technologies will be placed on your computer as described in this Cookie Policy.  By continuing to use the Site and/or by accepting our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://yougov.co.uk/about/terms-conditions/) and our [Privacy Policy](https://yougov.co.uk/about/privacy/), you are agreeing to the use of such cookies and tracking technology.

3.2  However, if you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by this Site (or, indeed, on any other site) you can do this through your browser settings. The ‘Help’ function within your browser should tell you how. You can also use your browser settings to select the “Do Not Track” option.

3.3  Alternatively, you may wish to visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/> which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers.  You will also find details on how to delete cookies from your computer, as well as more general information about cookies. Please note that, as these websites are not owned or operated by YouGov, we are not responsible for any of the content on them.

3.4  Please be aware that restricting cookies may mean that you will not be able to take full advantage of all the features or services available on this Site.

We use YouTube to show some of our video content and YouTube may set cookies on your browser in order to display the video and monitor non-attributable statistical information. Information on YouTube's privacy policy can be found here <http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/policies/privacy/>  
  
Google Analytics

| 

The Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.

These are the four main cookies set by the Google Analytics service which enables us to track visitor behaviour and measure performance of our Site (_utma, _utmb, _utmc and _utmz). Other cookies are associated with the Google Analytics service which enable us to understand how users are interacting with our Site (utmccn, utmcmd, utmctr and utmcct).

The Google Analytics cookies expire when you close your browser (with the exception of the _utmb cookie which expires after 30 minutes). The _utmb cookie is updated every time data is sent to Google Analytics. Any activity by a user within the 30 minute life span will count as a single visit, even if the user leaves and then returns to the site. A return after 30 minutes will count as a new visit from a returning visitor.

For how to reject or delete these cookies see [http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy/](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy.html)  
  
**6\. Email Tracking**

6.1  Some of the emails we send to you may contain a ‘web beacon pixel’ or tracked links which allows us to identify when you have opened the email and to verify which links contained in the email you have accessed.  We use this information to determine which parts of our emails are of most interest to you.

6.2  You can delete the pixel by deleting the email.  If you do not wish to download the pixel to your computer or other device, you can ensure this by selecting to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.

6.3  Alternatively you can unsubscribe from our mailing list by contacting us at [supportuk@yougov.com](mailto:supportuk@yougov.com).

**7\. Changes**

7.1  We may make changes to this Cookie Policy at any time by sending you an e-mail with the modified Terms or by posting a copy of them on the Site.  Any changes will take effect 7 days after the date of our email or the date on which we post the modified terms on the Site, whichever is the earlier.  Your continued use of the Site after that period expires means that you agree to be bound by the modified policy.
