							<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="3">
							YourBizWebsites.com and its advertisers may use

							<br>
							Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily 
							disclose personal information online - for example 
							through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - 
							that information can be collected and used by 
							others. In short, if you post personal information

							Additional Security:</b></font></p>
							<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma" size="3">Certain 
							Automated Income Stream Ltd media properties use a

							rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to 
							intercept the information. Other Automated Income 
							Stream Ltd media properties do not use SSL and 
							thereby do not offer a secure coded way to transfer 
							information.<br>
							<br>
							Ultimately, you are solely responsible for 
							maintaining the secrecy of your personal 
							information. Please be careful and responsible 
							whenever you're online.<br>
