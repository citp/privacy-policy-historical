                <h2>Online Store</h2>
                <p>Through the online store Futuremark collects information such as; email, name, company name, VAT number, street address, city, state, province, zip / postal code, country and phone number. The information is used only to validate and fulfill the purchase, and is not handed over to third parties for their promotional use.</p>
                <p>We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.</p>
                <p>The user's personal information may be shared with affiliates but only to validate &amp; fulfill the purchase and shipping. Affiliates do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.</p>
                <h2>Online Forms</h2>
                <p>We have some forms on our site for gathering / receiving information and feedback from our users. Through the forms we collect, but do not store, information such as name, email and in some cases phone numbers and / or street addresses. The information is used to be able to contact the user, and is not handed over to third parties for their promotional use.</p>
                <h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
                <p>Any personally identifiable information collected without limitation throughout the website, public forum areas of the web site, may be used for Futuremark marketing and online services. No personally identifiable information is sold, or handed over to third parties in a form that enables identification of any single user of the web site.</p>
                <h2>Public Forums Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>This site has public forums and chat available for its users. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public. You should be careful when disclosing your personal information.</p>
                <h2>Performance Database</h2>
                <p>We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.</p>
                <p>When you benchmark your computer you send your results to us, and you give us your permission to gather your computer's system information.</p>
                <p>By benchmarking your computer and sending your benchmark results to us, you also give us permission to process your personal data and send your computer system information to our Performance Database. It is from here that you are able to compare your results with those of other users from around the world. To be able to use the Performance Database you need to register. The registration requires your email, and a password. The email is optionally shown with the user's results to the public, and optionally used for emails from Futuremark about Futuremark's product updates, special offers as well as other company products, services, and special offers.</p>
                <h2>Services</h2>
                <p>Futuremark might give access to the above-described data to third parties, by creating services that make it possible to ask specific questions of our Database (about things like PC configurations with a specific graphic cards, etc.) and producing reports summarizing the data regarding these different kinds of computer configurations. In ABSOLUTELY NO instance do we ever attach personal user information to these services.</p>
                <h2>Links</h2>
                <p>Our websites contain links to other sites. Futuremark is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked websites, because their privacy practices may differ from ours.</p>
                <h2>Contests</h2>
                <p>We may run contests, prize draws and product give-aways on our websites. The methods for entering contests will be shown on our websites and may include asking for contact information such as email address. We may use the contact information from the entry form to send the user information about our company and its products, or to contact them when it becomes necessary (notices, updates, patches, etc.). Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below).</p>
                <p>If you're selected as a winner, you will be notified by email at the address you provided. Depending on the prize, you may be asked to provide a mailing address so that your prize can be delivered.</p>
                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>We have security measures in place to protect against unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of the information we hold. When you enter sensitive information on our site, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. We restrict access to personal information to a small number of Futuremark employees.</p>
                <p>We are committed to safeguarding the security of user information that is retained on our servers. Nevertheless, determined individuals may uncover such information and disclose it. For this reason, we cannot guarantee against unauthorized access to the information we hold about you.</p>
                <h2>Your choice</h2>
                <p>If you want to change or remove your data, or opt-out of promotional mailings from us you can:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>change your <a href="http://3dmark.com/settings">Futuremark Online Services Account Settings </a> to edit or remove your information or to opt out of our newsletter mailing list.</li>
                  <li>change your <a href="http://community.futuremark.com/forum/">Forum Profile Settings</a> to edit or remove your information or to opt out of our newsletter mailing list.</li>
                  <li>email <a href="mailto:privacy@futuremark.com">privacy@futuremark.com</a> with your request.</li>
                  <li>reply to any unwanted communication you receive.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
                <p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</p>
                <p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
                <h2>Legal disclaimer</h2>
                <p>When required by law, we may need to disclose personal information if we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
                  <li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
                  <li>protect the rights, property or safety of Futuremark, our employees, users or the public.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Company ownership</h2>
                <p>If Futuremark is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
                <h2>Changes</h2>
                <p>If there are changes to this policy, we will give notice on the <a href="/">Futuremark homepage</a>. If the changes affect the way we use personally identifiable information, we will notify affected users by email and give them the choice of opting-out of the new policy.</p>
