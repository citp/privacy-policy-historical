## In-app ads

Quick Preview widget 

For some websites (like Amazon for example), Quick Preview widget shows additional information, such as product details and its price, if a link to Amazon is present. In some cases (Amazon can still be used as an example), an affiliate ID - couponpartnerfvd or param_fvd-20 - would be added to the link when getting transferred to the site. The link on speed-dials still remains unchanged, just the way the user created it. 

Default dials 

When the app is installed, a few default speed dials are added. Some of those (for instance, Amazon, Booking etc.) would contain the affiliate ID in the link. Default speed dials are in no way different from regular ones, so users can delete or change them without the efficiency of the app affected in any way.
