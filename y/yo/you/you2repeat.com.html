            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last modified May 14, 2014</p>

    <p>You2Repeat Inc., ("you2repeat") takes your
        privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about you2repeat's
        Privacy Policy ("Policy"). This Policy details how you2repeat receives,
        collects and uses information in connection with its website located at www.you2repeat.com
        and through your use of the Services.
    </p>

    <p>Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized
        terms shall have the same meaning ascribed to them in the you2repeat Terms of Use.
    </p>

    <p>Collection and Use of Information</p>

    <p>Information You Provide:</p>

    <p>When you register on the Website for the Service, you will
        be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information, which may
        include your name, email address, age, gender, address, telephone number(s),
        areas of interest, login name, login password, billing information, profile
        information and other self-identifying information (all "Personal
        Information"). you2repeat collects Personal Information primarily for the
        following purposes: (i) to maintain a record of registered users; (ii) to
        manage the login process and maintain users' personal preferences; (iii) to
        email registered users with news and software updates; (iv) to email
        promotional offers; and (iv) customer support and product information. If you no longer wish to receive communication
        from you2repeat, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in any of
        those communications or update your account setting information (see section
        below on Change or Removal of Information).
    </p>

    <p>you2repeat may also make certain message boards and forums
        available to you for your feedback or other communication (collectively,
        "Forums"). You are solely responsible for the information and other
        content you post on and through these Forums and should be aware that when you
        voluntarily disclose Personal Information on or through these Forums, such
        information is generally accessible to and may be collected and used by other
        users. This Privacy Policy will not cover such disclosure of information. You
        are encouraged to exercise discretion when providing personal information about
        yourself in and through any Forums.
    </p>

    <p>Information you2repeat Automatically Collects:</p>

    <p>you2repeat does not automatically collect any Personal
        Information on or through the Website, except as provided by you in connection
        with the registration process.  However,
        when you use the Website, you2repeat may also automatically collect certain
        information about your computer to facilitate, evaluate and verify your use of
        the Website. For example, you2repeat may
        use "cookies," "web beacons" and similar devices to track your activities on
        the Website. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an
        individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. A web-beacon is a small transparent gif image
        that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email
        has been viewed. Cookies make
        web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are on
        the Website. Cookies may be used to analyze Website usage, improve content,
        customize the Website's content and layout and for other customer service
        purposes. you2repeat's use of cookies or similar devices is not linked to any Personal Information.
    </p>

    <p>When you visit the Website, you2repeat may automatically
        receive and record certain non-personally identifiable information on its
        server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser type,
        internet service provider (ISP), cookie information, and the webpage that you
        visit. you2repeat collects non-personally
        identifiable information for general purposes, including but not limited to
        analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking user movements, conducting
        research, and providing anonymous reporting to internal and external clients. you2repeat will not link any Personal
        Information, including e-mail addresses, with the aggregate data of its
        users. Please be aware that some
        non-personally identifiable information such as Uniform Resource Locators
        ("URL's) or Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses could become Personal
        Information when combined by third parties with the ISP's records.
        you2repeat does NOT do this with your information.
    </p>

    <p>Sharing and Disclosure of Information</p>

    <p>you2repeat does not rent, sell, or share any information about
        the user with any third-parties.  you2repeat
        may disclose your Personal Information if you2repeat believes such action is
        necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on you2repeat; (b)
        protect and defend the rights or property of you2repeat (including the enforcement
        of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal
        safety of users of you2repeat services or members of the public. you2repeat may
        share aggregated non-personally identifiable demographic information about
        users with third party advertising and content companies. This information does
        not identify individual users and you2repeat does not link aggregate user data
        with Personal Information.
    </p>

    &lt;
    <p>Third party advertisers and websites<br><br>
        you2repeat does not actively share Personal Information with third party advertisers
        for their direct marketing purposes unless you give you2repeat your consent. Advertisers, however, may
        obtain public information about you from your user profile and other public
        sources. Remember, third parties
        will have access to your Personal Information if you provide it to them. For
        example, if you want to buy offers, goods or services from through third party
        advertisers on the Website, the transaction may be facilitated on the third
        party's website. You will then have to provide the third party with the
        information required (such as for example name, shipping address, credit card
        info etc), which will them be subject to their specific privacy policies. If you access another website or promotion
        and/or service through a website operated by any entity other than you2repeat,
        that site is referred to as a "Third Party Site".Unless you2repeat clearly indicates otherwise
        at the time of collection, you2repeat does not share Personal Information with
        Third Party Sites. Please be aware
        however that these Third Party Sites may collect information about you. Please see the Third Party Site's privacy
        policy to better understand what information is collected, how it is used and
        shared, and your choices regarding control. you2repeat has no control over these linked Third
        Party Sites, each of which has a separate privacy and data collection practice,
        independent of this Privacy Policy. you2repeat
        does not monitor, control, or endorse the information collection or privacy
        practices of any Third Party Site. As
        such, you2repeat is not responsible for, or have control over, the content or the
        privacy policies of these Third Party Sites. You must read the privacy policies
        of each and every website that you visit when linking from the Website. This
        Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by you2repeat.
    </p>

    <p>Children's Privacy</p>

    <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially
        important. you2repeat operates the Website in compliance with the
        <em>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</em> (COPPA). The Website is intended solely for
        users who are of adult age in their jurisdiction (over 18), and any
        registration by, use of, or access to the Website or services by anyone under
        the age of majority is unauthorized, unlicensed, and in violation of this
        Privacy Policy. By using the Website,
        you represent and warrant you are of adult age in your jurisdiction and that
        you agree to abide by all of the terms and conditions herein. you2repeat may terminate your account, project,
        and any content or information that you have posted on the Website and/or
        prohibit you from using or accessing the Website for any reason, at any time in
        its sole discretion, with or without notice, including without limitation if you2repeat
        believes that you have misrepresented your age. you2repeat never knowingly collects
        or maintains information at or on the Website from those you2repeat actually knows
        are under 13, and no part of the Website is directed at or structured to
        attract anyone under 13.
    </p>

    <p>Security</p>

    <p>you2repeat takes reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information
        from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although you2repeat cannot guarantee
        that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, you2repeat
        has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the Personal
        Information. Personal Information is protected by secured networks and access
        is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of
        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <p>If you contact you2repeat by e-mail or a "contact us" or similar feature on the Website,you should be aware that
        your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.
    </p>

    <p>Passwords are encrypted and you2repeat policies preclude access to passwords by anyone
        at you2repeat or its service providers except on a need-to-know basis. You are responsible for maintaining the
        strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible
        for any access to or use of the Website by you or any person or entity using
        your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on
        behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or
        agent. You agree to (a) immediately
        notify you2repeat of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any
        other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the
        end of each session. It is your sole
        responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control
        access to and use of your account, and notify you2repeat when you desire to
        cancel your account. you2repeat will not
        be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to
        comply with this provision.
    </p>


    <p>In the unlikely event that you2repeat believes that the security of your Personal Information in
        our possession or control may have been compromised, you2repeat may seek to
        notify you of that development. If a
        notification is appropriate, you2repeat will endeavor to do so as promptly as
        possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent you2repeat has your e-mail
        address, it may notify you by e-mail.
        You consent to use of e-mail as a means of such notification.
    </p>

    <p>If you prefer to use another method to
        notify you in this situation, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:general@you2repeat.com">general@you2repeat.com</a>
        with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.
    </p>

    <p>IF YOU ARE A USER ACCESSING THE WEBSITE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, ASIA, OR ANY OTHER REGION
        WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION, USE, AND
        DISCLOSURE THAT DIFFER FROM UNITED STATES LAWS, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THROUGH
        YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES, WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY UNITED STATES LAW,
        THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND you2repeat' TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL
        INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND YOU CONSENT TO THAT TRANSFER.
        ADDITIONALLY, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED
        TO AND PROCESSED IN COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS
        REGARDING PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN IN YOUR
        COUNTRY.
    </p>

    <p>Data Retention</p>

    <p>you2repeat will retain your information for as long as your
        account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request
        that you2repeat no longer uses your information to provide you services, you may
        delete your account by notification to <a href="mailto:general@you2repeat.com">general@you2repeat.com</a>. you2repeat may retain and use your information
        as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
        enforce our agreements. Consistent with
        these requirements, you2repeat will try to delete your information quickly and
        upon request. Please note, however, that
        there may be latency in deleting information from the you2repeat servers and backed-up
        versions might exist after deletion.
    </p>

    <p>Business Transitions</p>

    <p>In the event that you2repeat goes through a business
