We may maintain pages for our company, and our products and services on third-party platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Instagram, and other social networking services. When you interact with our pages on those third-party platforms, the third-party’s privacy policy will govern your interactions on the relevant platform. You may choose to provide us with information through the third-party platform, and we will treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If the third party platform provides us with information about our pages on those platforms or your interactions with them, we will also treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Information we obtain from other third parties

We may receive personal information about you from third-party sources, such as our business or marketing partners. We may combine this information with information that we have collected from you or other sources.

### Cookies and other information collected by automated means

We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and activity occurring on or through the Websites. The information that may be collected automatically includes your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, device identifier, browser type, screen resolution, IP address, the website you visited before browsing to our website, general location information such as city, state or geographic area; and information about your use of and actions on the Websites, such as pages you viewed, how long you spent on a page, navigation paths between pages, information about your activity on a page, access times, and length of access. Our service providers and business partners may collect this type of information over time and across third-party websites and mobile applications. This information is collected using cookies, browser web storage, Flash LSOs, web beacons, and similar technologies, and our emails may also contain web beacons.

A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. “Browser web storage,” also known as locally stored objects (“LSOs”), is used for similar purposes as cookies. Browser web storage enables the storage of a larger amount of data than cookies. A “web beacon,” also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF, is typically used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of our websites.

Web browsers may offer users of our websites the ability to disable receiving certain types of cookies; however, if cookies are disabled, some features or functionality of our websites may not function correctly. Please see the “Targeted online advertising” section for information about how to exercise choice regarding the use of browsing behavior for purposes of targeted advertising.

### Referrals

Website users may have the opportunity to refer friends or other contacts to us. If you are an existing user, you may only submit a referral if you have permission to provide the referral’s contact information to us.

We may also create de-identified data from your personal information and other individuals whose personal information we collect by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We may use this de-identified data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including analyzing and improving the Websites and promoting our business.

### How we share your personal information

#### Affiliates

We may share your personal information with current or future members of the CSC Generation group of companies, including our corporate parent, subsidiary, and affiliate companies.

#### Service providers

We may share your personal information with third party companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Websites (such as customer support, order fulfillment, hosting, analytics, email delivery, marketing, and database management services). These third parties may use your personal information only as directed or authorized by us and in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and are prohibited from using or disclosing your information for any other purpose.

#### Business and strategic partners

We may sometimes share your personal information with business and strategic partners. These may include partners that run a joint promotion with us or other partners whose products or services we think may be of interest to you. If you receive marketing emails from these partners, you may opt out of such communications by following the instructions provided in the email.

We do not control how other users or third parties use any information that is publicly available on our Websites.

#### Professional advisors

We may disclose your personal information to professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.

#### For compliance, fraud prevention and safety

We may share your personal information as we believe necessary or appropriate to: (a) comply with applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities; (b) protect our, your or others’ rights, privacy, safety or property (including by making and defending legal claims); (c) enforce the terms and conditions that govern the Websites; and (d) protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity.

If you receive marketing text messages from us, you may opt out of receiving further marketing text messages from us by replying STOP to our marketing message.

#### Cookies & browser web storage

We may allow service providers and other third parties to use cookies and similar technologies to track your browsing activity over time and across the Websites and third party websites. Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies, the Sites may not work properly. Similarly, your browser settings may allow you to clear your browser web storage.

#### Targeted online advertising

Some of the business partners that collect information about users’ activities on or through the Websites may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behavior for purposes of targeted advertising.

Users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking here or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking here. Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms that we linked above.

If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.

#### Do Not Track

Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” or similar signals. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

#### Other sites, mobile applications and services

Our Websites may contain links to other websites, mobile applications, and online services operated by third parties. These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party. In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated with us. We do not control third party websites, mobile applications, or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites you visit and mobile applications and online services you use.

#### Security practices

The security of your personal information is important to us. We employ a number of organizational, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Websites (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting).
