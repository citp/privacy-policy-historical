Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every notification that points users to the subscription management page.

The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.
  5. **Polling** : We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. **youlookfab.com** may use a system to “tag” users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.

We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners.

They can specify a username (required), website (optional), location (optional), occupation (optional) and interests (optional) in their profile and other users will see this information.
