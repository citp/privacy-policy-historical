Recognition, Collection, and Uses of Personal Data We Collect

When you visit our webpage, our web server automatically recognizes only your computer's domain name, but not your e-mail address or any other personally identifiable information. This renders your visit virtually anonymous, unless you log in to one of the controlled-access areas of our site or otherwise volunteer other personal information (such as survey information and/or site registrations, name and address, telephone number, fax number, and payment information). We also may collect anonymous aggregate information on what pages you and other consumers access or visit; user-specific information on what pages you or other consumers access or visit; and any information volunteered by you, the consumer, in connection with our business.

The aggregate information we collect is used for many different purposes in order to serve you better. Among these purposes are to improve the content of our webpage; to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor; and to notify consumers about updates to our website.

We will disclose personal data we have collected only when legally required to do so at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our website and applicable laws; or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website.

Certain information about you may be available to authorized distributors, who can view information regarding the product order history, names, and addresses of distributors or customers in their own downline, but payment information you may give us in the course of ordering our products will be disclosed only to necessary Distributor Network Services staff to fulfill your order, and will never be available to an outside third party for any reason but a legal investigation. Social Security or Taxpayer Identification numbers may also be collected from you upon sign-up as a Young Living distributor, but will only be used in accordance with Internal Revenue Service policyâ€”they will not be available to anyone else for any other purpose.
