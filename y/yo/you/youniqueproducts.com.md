# Younique, Inc. Privacy Policy Notice

                                     Younique, Inc. Privacy Policy Notice
Introduction
Younique, LLC, a company organized under the laws of the State of Utah (referred to herein as
“Younique,” “we,” “us” and “our”) understands the importance of privacy of individuals (referred to as
“users” and “you”). This privacy notice outlines the personal information Younique may collect and how
Younique will use and disclose that information.
Information Collection
Younique may collect two different types of information, Personally Identifiable Information and Non-
Personally Identifiable Information. “Personally Identifiable Information” (“PII”) is information that
identifies you as an individual – for example, your name, address, telephone number, email address,
credit card information, billing address and shipping information. “Non-Personally Identifiable
Information” (“Non-PII”) is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses, user
behavior data from web interaction metrics tools and any other information that does not reveal your
specific identity. In connection with our Presenter enrollment process, Younique may collect PII about
you that may be considered sensitive. Younique may also collect PII about you from, among other
places: information you provide directly to us, information regarding the services that Younique
currently provides or has previously provided to you, information Younique receives from our affiliated
entities or third parties relating to the establishment of our relationship or the provision of services to
you. This information can be received in any manner, including in-person discussions, telephone
conversations, and electronic or other written communications.
Information Use
Younique may collect PII about you to establish or maintain our relationship with you, respond to your
inquiries, provide you with services you have requested, keep you informed of services we think may be
of interest to you, personalize your experience with us, and other reasons. Without PII, Younique may
be unable to provide you with the services you have requested.
Disclosure of Information
Younique does not sell or lease PII about you to others.
Younique may share PII about you with others as permitted by contractual agreement or as required by
law, such as our affiliates, third parties in connection with the provision of services to you, government
entities and regulatory bodies, and those with whom you have requested us to share information.
Younique requires third parties who perform services for us to agree to treat PII about you confidentially
and securely.
Unless restricted by law, regulation, contract or professional standards, Younique may transfer PII about
you outside of the United States to other countries for the purposes described in this privacy notice.
Younique will not share PII about you with an unaffiliated third party who is not performing services for
us without first obtaining your permission, except if such sharing is otherwise permitted by this privacy
notice.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this notice or the Terms and Conditions of Use to the contrary,
we reserve the right to disclose and use your PII if we believe that we are required to do so: (a) by law;
(b) in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena; (c) in response
to a law enforcement agency’s request; (d) to enforce our other terms, conditions, or policies; (e) to
protect our operations; (f) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Younique, you or others;
and/or (g) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages we may sustain. For example,
we may to the fullest extent the law allows, disclose PII about you to law enforcement agencies to assist
them in identifying individuals who have been or may be engaged in unlawful activities.


Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we reserve the right to use Non-PII, and to disclose
Non-PII to third parties, for any purpose. NOTE THAT THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE
PRIVACY PRACTICES OR POLICIES OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING YOUNIQUE PRESENTERS. However,
Younique Presenters agree, as specified in our Policies and Procedures, to comply with all applicable
privacy laws and regulations.
Access
You may request access to the PII that Younique has about you. You may also request the correction,
amendment or deletion of PII about you that is inaccurate. Younique will treat requests for access,
correction, amendment or deletion of PII about you in accordance with its internal policies and
applicable legal requirements.
Information Security
Younique maintains reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect PII from
loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Our personnel and the
personnel of our affiliates are provided access to PII about you only if they have a need to know the
information in connection with a legitimate business purpose, such as (a) the provision of services to
you or (b) to help identify other services that Younique and its affiliates offer that may be of interest or
use to you.
Changes to This Privacy Notice
Younique reserves the right to change this privacy notice. Any changes to this notice will become
effective upon posting of the revised notice on the Internet or as required by law.
