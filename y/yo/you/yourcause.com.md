YourCause.com is committed to safeguarding your privacy online and has prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information through the online community Web site, [www.YourCause.com](http://www.yourcause.com/) (the “Community”).  
**Information Collected**  
We automatically track and collect the following information (“Standard Web Traffic Information”) when you visit our Web site: your IP address, domain server, type of computer, and type of web browser. This information assists us in administering our Web site and diagnosing problems, and in improving your experience in our Community.

We also use “Cookies” (described below) to save your password so you do not have to reenter it each time you visit our Web site.

For you to access certain services offered through the Community, we require you to become a member of our Community by providing us with your name, email address, zip code, sex, date of birth and country (“Contact Information”). At your discretion, you may provide us with personal information in addition to your basic Contact Information.

If you post information on any of our blogs, testimonials, forums, message boards, or any other input method we provide, such information you provide may be available to other members of the Community and other Web site visitors.

If you create your own Cause Page, you may elect either a Basic Service Account, at no charge, or a Premium Service Account for a monthly fee. If you elect a Premium Service Account, we collect additional information consisting of your credit or debit card details, including a card type, a card number and an expiration date (“Credit Card Information”).

If you make an online donation, we collect Credit Card Information from you.

YourCause.com will make your Contact Information available to the credit card authorization company when necessary to process a donation made by you to your chosen charity. In addition, we will make your Contact Information available to the charity or charities to which you have made donations. We also make your information available to the fundraiser who's Cause Page you have contributed through. When you make a donation to a Cause Page, your name will appear publicly on that page.

We do not share your Credit Card Information. We do not retain your Credit Card Information, except to process payments for Premium Services.

Please note that if you are creating your own Cause Page, we will pass on your name, address and email address to your chosen charity for administrative purposes. Your information may also be made available to the charity’s agent or third-party event organizer specified by your charity. 

When we pass along your Contact Information to charities, YourCause.com cannot control how charities use this information. If you prefer not to receive future communications from the charity (other than any acknowledgment the charity may provide of your donation), please contact the charity directly.

We may share aggregate Standard Web Traffic Information (such as statistical, demographic and IP information) with third parties, however, this information does not include your Contact Information.  
  
**Tell a Friend**  
If a member elects to use our “Tell a Friend” function, we ask them for the friend’s email address and automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Cause Page specified by the member. This information is stored temporarily for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  
**Confidentiality and Security of Contact Information**  
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Contact Information with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary (as determined in our sole discretion) to comply with a court order or other legal process or protect the rights or property of YourCause.com or its affiliates.

Although YourCause.com uses reasonable measures to maintain the security of your Contact Information, no company, organization, or online community, including YourCause.com, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information.
