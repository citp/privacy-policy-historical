      <p align="center">PRIVACY POLICY</p>
      </b>
      <p>Last Updated: January 22, 2006</p>
      <p>YouChanDoIt.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of 
      Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized 
      experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, 
      e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of 
      this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email 
      address to any unauthorized third party. Period."</p>
      <b>
      <p>How we gather information from users</p>
      </b>
      <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are 
      visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the 
      services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information 
      when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request 
      certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may 
      provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, 
      message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. 
      Like most Web sites, YouChanDoIt.com also collects information 
      automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be 
      transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your 
      Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and 
      hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store 
      your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that 
      information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you 
      encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt 
      additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. 
      In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for 
      example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do 
      you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked 
      to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to 
      customize the site’s features according to your preferences.</p>
      <b>
      <p>What we do with the information we collect</p>
      </b>
      <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit 
      and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your 
      privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
      <p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify 
      you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information 
      about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other 
      users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages 
      are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated 
      Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business 
      partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally 
      Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you 
      individually.</p>
      <p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
      YouChanDoIt.com to communicate with you about your registration and 
      customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; 
      services and products offered by YouChanDoIt.com and other topics we think 
      you might find of interest. </p>
      <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by YouChanDoIt.com may 
      also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site 
      administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, 
      administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with 
      you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation 
      of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such 
      information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In 
      addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may 
      sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such 
      transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may 
      also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other 
      times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in 
      connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law 
      enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. 
      Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such 
      cases.</p>

      <p>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</p>
      </b>
      <p>YouChanDoIt.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to 
      respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, 
      including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content 
      providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data 
      collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our 
      site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a YouChanDoIt.com 
      page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. 
      Also, through YouChanDoIt.com you may be introduced to, or be able to 
      access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered 
      by other parties. YouChanDoIt.com is not responsible for the actions or 
      policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy 
      policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or 
      page operated by a third party.</p>
      <p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third 
      parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of 
      your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of 
      our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that 
      enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular 
      advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer 
      services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology 
      to gather information. YouChanDoIt.com does not control the use of this 
      technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not 
      responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
      <p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally 
      Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that 
      information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third 
      parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from 
      other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control 
      of YouChanDoIt.com and this policy.</p>
