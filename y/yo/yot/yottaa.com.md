* ### Use of Cookies

The Yottaa website uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Yottaa pages, or register with Yottaa site or services, a cookie helps Yottaa to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Yottaa website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Yottaa features that you customized. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Yottaa services or websites you visit. 

If you provide Yottaa with user information, you have the following rights with respect to that information: 

  1. To review the user information that you have supplied to us 
  2. To request that we correct any errors, outdated information, or omissions in user information that you have supplied to us 
  3. To request that your user information not be used to contact you 
  4. To request that your user information be removed from any solicitation list that we use 
  5. To request that your user information be deleted from our records and 
  6. To opt out of being solicited by this website or third parties 



If you request that your user information be deleted from our records, there may be a brief delay in our processing that request, while verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party. If you request that your information be deleted, we reserve the right to terminate and/or limit your access to the Yottaa website. 

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at info@Yottaa.com. 

* ### Security of your Personal Information

No method of safeguarding information is 100% secure. Yottaa uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Yottaa secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
