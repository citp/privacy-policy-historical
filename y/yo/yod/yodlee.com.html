<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<dl class="expand">
<dt><em>What categories of Personal Information does the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service collect?</em></dt>
<dd>In order to use the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service, Yodlee requires you to create a Yodlee MoneyCenter username and password. During registration you are required to give contact information such as name, address and email address. Specifically, Yodlee collects the following categories of personal information about you through the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service:<p></p>
<p><strong>A. Registration Information:</strong> When you register for the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service, you will be asked for basic registration information, such as a Yodlee MoneyCenter username and password which you choose, name, address, demographic information (such as age, income) and an e-mail address for Yodlee Customer Service. Additional information may be required to utilize value-added features of the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service, such as Auto-Registration and Password Reset, or to access specific third party Internet services using the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service. This information may include your passwords and user names for the third party web sites and Internet services. We will use this information for providing the services you requested and accessing the web sites you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you but such information is not required to register for the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service.</p>
<p><strong>B. Information on Your Use of the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service: </strong>As with most online businesses, Yodlee MoneyCenter logs information about your access and use of the Yodlee MoneyCenter web site, including (i) your transactions conducted on the Yodlee MoneyCenter web site, including through the use of Internet cookies (discussed below), (ii) the IP addresses from which you came to the site, and (iii) your communications with the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service and web site.</p>
<p><strong>C. Information From Third Party Web Sites: </strong>In order to display information to you through the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service, the Service must collect, on your behalf, your account and other personal information from third party web sites and Internet services that you register on the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service.

<p><strong>D. Information From Yodlee MoneyCenter Service Partners:</strong> Yodlee may arrange for one or more services on the Yodlee MoneyCenter web site to be provided to you in whole or in part by a third party partner. For example, Yodlee may arrange for a third party partner to provide electronic funds transfer services to you on the Yodlee MoneyCenter web site. The services of these third party partners are governed by their privacy policies, not the Yodlee MoneyCenter Privacy Policy. This third party partner may share information with Yodlee on your transactions with them, for display on the Yodlee MoneyCenter web site and for purposes permissible under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>E. Information From Security, Fraud and Risk Service providers: </strong>Yodlee may arrange for one or more service providers to provide background information on you if you are performing financial transactions on the Yodlee MoneyCenter web site.

</dd>
<dt><em>What categories of my Personal Information gathered through the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service does the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service disclose?</em></dt>
<dd>Your personal information will not be sold, shared, rented or traded with any affiliated or unaffiliated third parties, except (i) to provide you with the Yodlee MoneyCenter Services, (ii) pursuant to joint marketing arrangements described below, or (iii) as required or permitted by law. For example, in order to provide you with the Yodlee MoneyCenter Services, Yodlee MoneyCenter may disclose your username and passwords to third party web sites, such as web sites operated by a credit card company or a bank, in order to obtain the information that you requested be aggregated and displayed through the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service.

Yodlee may disclose registration information and information on your use of the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service (excluding information regarding transactions on your aggregated accounts) to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, or to other financial institutions with whom Yodlee offers you products and services pursuant to joint marketing agreements. For example, Yodlee may share your personal information with a nonaffiliated third party to offer you a new service on the Yodlee MoneyCenter web site that is provided jointly by Yodlee and an unaffiliated company. Yodlee reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Yodlee. Yodlee does present an opt-out option during registration for users who do not wish to share their information for joint marketing purposes as described in the prior paragraph. The user may change the opt-out choice at any time by going to the Options page in Yodlee PersonalFinance menu and selecting Edit Personal Profile. Yodlee reserves the right to share aggregated information with third parties in which case personal information about you will never be disclosed.</dd>
<dt><em>Will I be contacted if I register for the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service?</em></dt>
<dd>Yodlee will occasionally contact users by electronic mail to send information or inform them of new features, or to request participation in market surveys.

This choice can be changed at any time by going to the Options page in the Yodlee PersonalFinance menu and selecting Edit Personal Profile. However, in order to ensure the quality of the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service, Yodlee will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. These include a “Welcome Notice” to confirm new membership, “notifications” of password changes or “account lockouts” and other “customer satisfaction” and “customer service” issues. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</dd>
