Additional information may be required to utilize value-added features of the My Yodlee Service, such as Auto-Registration and Password Reset, or to access specific third party Internet services using the My Yodlee Service. This information may include your passwords and user names for the third party web sites and Internet services. We will use this information for providing the services and accessing the web sites you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you.<br><br>

Yodlee may disclose registration information and information on your use of the My Yodlee Service (excluding information regarding transactions on your aggregated accounts) to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, or to other financial institutions with whom Yodlee offers you products and services pursuant to joint marketing agreements. For example, Yodlee may share your personal information with a nonaffiliated third party to respond to a subpoena, to protect and defend the rights and property of Yodlee, or to offer you a new service on the My Yodlee web site that is provided jointly by Yodlee and an unaffiliated company. <br><br>

The user may change the opt-out choice at any time by going to the preferences page within the My Yodlee Service. Yodlee reserves the right to share aggregated information with third parties in which case<b> personal information about you will never be disclosed.</b><p>

<b></b></p></li><li><b>Will I be contacted if I register for the My Yodlee Service?</b><br><br>
Yodlee will occasionally contact users by electronic mail to inform them of new features, or to request participation in market surveys. The My Yodlee Service offers an opt-out option to users when signing up for the My Yodlee Service for those who do not wish to receive such messages. However, in order to ensure the quality of the My Yodlee Service, Yodlee will send certain types of messages from which users will not be able to opt-out. These include a "Welcome Notice" to confirm new membership, "notifications" of password changes or "account lockouts" and other "customer satisfaction" and "customer service" issues.<p>

A cookie is simply a text file, which indicates your My Yodlee ID or session identification number. This cookie will only be returned to our server if your browser is set to allow sending of cookies (you can also set it to check for permission before sending cookies). We use cookies for a variety of purposes intended to make the My Yodlee Service a better service for you. For example, we use this cookie to identify existing users of the My Yodlee Service when they enter the web site so that we are able to pre-fill their My Yodlee ID and so that they may receive a start page more optimized for current subscribers than for new users. We also use a cookie to maintain session information for logged in users, to prevent the need for re-entry of login information when browsing outside the My Yodlee Service.<br><br>
We reserve the right to use cookies to deliver content specific to your needs and interests. We may also use cookies to track user trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of our sites that our users find valuable.<br><br>
