#### Information Yodle May Collect

A. Identifying Information. Yodle may collect identifying information provided by any User, including, but not limited to, a first and last name; a home, business, or other physical address; a telephone number; an email address, as well as any other identifying information that may be submitted via the Site, included in an e-mail or conveyed in a telephone call (collectively, "Identifying Information"). In general, Yodle collects Identifying Information from Site Users in connection with inquiries about Yodle's services and notes the referring URL (e.g., the search engine that directed you to Yodle). If a User sends an email to a Yodle agent, employee and/or affiliate, Yodle may store the Information provided in connection with that e-mail. In addition, Yodle records and monitors User communications with Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates via e-mail and telephone.

B. Anonymous Browsing Information and Non-Identifying Information. Yodle may collect general, non-identifying, statistical information about the use of the Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. Yodle collects this information through the use of "cookies", and Yodle may aggregate this information. A cookie is a small text file that a website transfers to an individual's computer, mobile device, or tablet for record-keeping purposes. For example, Yodle may use cookies to collect information about Site activity. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. Anonymous browsing and non-identifying information is not used, nor is it intended to be used, by Yodle to identify an individual.
