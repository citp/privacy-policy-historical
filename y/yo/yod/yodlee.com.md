This information may include your passwords and user names for the third party web sites and Internet services.

The Yodlee MoneyCenter Service stores a cookie on your computer if you have cookies enabled. If you do not have cookies enabled, you will be unable to use the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service. A cookie is simply a text file, which indicates your Yodlee MoneyCenter or session identification number. This cookie will only be returned to our server if your browser is set to allow sending of cookies (you can also set it to check for permission before sending cookies). We use cookies for a variety of purposes intended to make the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service a better service for you. For example, we use this cookie to identify existing users of the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service when they enter the web site so that we are able to pre-fill their Yodlee MoneyCenter and so that they may receive a start page more optimized for current subscribers than for new users. We also use a cookie to maintain session information for logged in users, to prevent the need for re-entry of login information when browsing outside the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service. We reserve the right to use cookies to deliver content specific to your needs and interests. We may also use cookies to track user trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of our sites that our users find valuable.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

Our third party service provider employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.
