Last Updated: September 12, 2016 YI Technologies, INC. (“we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to its websites and users of its mobile applications, products, and services (each a “Service” and collectively the “Services”). When you access, browse, or use the Services, information will be collected, transferred, processed, stored, and disclosed in accordance with this privacy policy (“Policy”). This Policy governs the information collection and disclosure practices for the Services.

1\. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES   
1.1. General. When you visit a web site without registering, you can browse without submitting personal information about yourself. If you register for an account within or to access a Service, we will collect some personally identifiable information from you, including your full name, username, email address, and a password that you select. When you interact with the Services, we also receive and store certain additional types of information which, in general, do not directly identify you. For example, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device including your IP address, browser type and language, referring/exit pages and URLs, other browser history, device type, WIFI network information (including name and password), platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, cookie information, the pages you requested and viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time. This Section of the Policy outlines the various ways that information is collected from the Services. Please fully review this Policy before you use the Services or submit information to us.   
1.2. Information that You Provide.   
(a) Registration and Login. Certain Services require you to register for an account and/or log in using credentials. You can register for an account from our account registration system, or a third party site or service such as Facebook (“Account”). When you register for an Account you will be asked to provide some personally identifiable information, such as your full name, email address, phone number, camera SN code and a user name and password that you select. When you are asked to create an Account using your credentials from a third party site or service, you will be asked for your user name, password, and other information to verify that you have an account with the third party site or service. When you provide credentials for a third party site or service, we may use those credential to obtain information about you from that third party. See Section 1.4 (Information from Other Sources) and 3.5 (Social Sites) for more information. When you register an Account and log in to a Service you must provide your current, complete, and accurate information. It is your responsibility to keep your information up to date. We are not responsible for any problems, interruptions in access, or liability that may arise if you do not give us complete and accurate information or if you fail to update your information so that it is current.   
(b) Product Set Up. In order to use certain products such as our camera products, you will need to associate the product with your Account following the directions provided with the product. When you associate a product with your Account you will need to provide WIFI network information (including username and password) and provide a unique identifier associated with your Account (e.g. by scanning a QR code we provide you). Once a product is associated with your Account it will remain associated until you unbind the product from your Account or terminate your Account.  
(c) Correspondence. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us information about your use of the Services, we may save the information in a profile specific to you.  
1.3. Automatically Collected Information. We will collect some information about you and any product or device you use to access or use the Services automatically using a variety of technologies. In general, automatically collected information about use of the Services does not directly identify you and the information may include your diagnostic log information, IP address, browser type and language, referring/exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, cookie information, the pages you requested and viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the actions performed in the APP, the info(OS type/version, network, etc.) of the phone which the APP was installed, and the date and time. We collect this information for the purposes described in this Policy, including to better understand our customer base and to improve the quality of our Services.   
(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer. Our third-party analytics provider uses cookies to record information about your activities on the Services to “remember” you when you return to the Services. Some cookies remain on your computer or device until you delete them. Others, like session ID cookies, expire when you close your browser. You may set your browser setting to attempt to reject cookies and you may still use the Services. See the section “Do-Not Track Settings” below for more information on how the Services may respond to your browser settings. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.

Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixels are small graphics that are about the size of the period at the end of the sentence that are embedded invisibly on web pages or in HTML-based emails. Our third-party analytics provider may place pixels on our Services that track what other websites you visit (both before and after visiting the Services). Our third-party analytics provider uses information obtained from pixels to help us improve our business and the Services. We do not control the use of pixels by third parties.
