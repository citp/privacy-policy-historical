#### What personal information about users does Yipit collect?

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website.

Yipit may collect personally identifying information during the registration process, including name, email address, address, gender, store preferences etc. Yipit also may, on occasion collect user preference information (such as items clicked from emails). We may also store information users knowingly provide such as feedback forms, suggestions, and emails to the Yipit website. Yipit may use such information for its internal purposes, including, but not limited to, email and web design optimizations, new features, and editorial and feedback purposes. Information entered may be aggregated across all users in order to determine and target demographics for marketing and advertising purposes.

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Yipit will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.

#### What about cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Yipit cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on many browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Yipit's most attractive features.

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

#### Will Yipit share any of the information it receives?

We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Yipit, our employees, our users, or others.

We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our web site, including through our emails. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
