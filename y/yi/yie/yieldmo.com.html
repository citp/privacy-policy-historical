      <h3 class="headline-cap">Tracking Technologies Used</h3>
      <p>Yieldmo may collect the information noted in this Policy using cookies and non-cookie technologies. Yieldmo may collect information using the following methods:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> cookies, which are small data files that are stored on a visitor’s computer or device, including in temporary cache available in HTML 5 compatible browsers;</li>
          <li> web beacons or pixels (pieces of code used by websites or third-parties to assign online activities to a computer or browser);</li>

An End User of the Yieldmo Service may opt-out of interest-based advertising from Yieldmo. The method of opting-out depends on the browser or device being used; please refer to the Section entitled “Opt-Out of Interest-Based Advertising” below for specific opt-out instructions for your browser or device.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Types of Information Collected</strong>
        Yieldmo partners with numerous companies to provide online advertisements to end users of mobile websites, mobile applications (“Apps) and other online media (“End Users”). As an End User browses the mobile Internet or uses Apps that include references to the Yieldmo Service, the End User’s browser or device may request advertisements from Yieldmo’s system. When Yieldmo receives these requests, and/or when Yieldmo delivers advertisements to such browser or device, we may collect Non-PII about these interactions (as well as any further interaction with the advertisements provided by the Yieldmo Service such as views, clicks, conversions, etc.). This may include, for example: IP address; unique identifiers sent to us from mobile devices, network carriers or data providers; information contained in http headers or other internet transfer protocol signals; de-identified personal information (such as email addresses or usernames that are "hashed" so as to be non-identifiable or non-linkable to an individual); anonymous demographic information such as a user's gender, age, and income range when not tied or not linkable to personal identifiers; attributes of computer or device usage, such as advertisements clicked, websites and content areas visited; date and time of advertisement request, and advertisement delivery and interaction activities; browser type and version; operating system; language setting; information about or from the presence or use of Apps on a mobile device; and location. Such information is stored on Yieldmo’s servers. We may also use the GPS location of your device if you have opted to provide it to Yieldmo or to one of Yieldmo’s publisher or third party data provider partners. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or the manufacture of your particular device. On occasion, we may also receive information from third-parties that enables advertisement optimization, independently of or in combination with the information collected by Yieldmo, such as audience interest segments and product categories.   From time to time, advertisements served by Yieldmo may contain functionality that enables an End User to enter PII into such advertisements, in order to allow the End User to sign-up for or receive information regarding a product or service offered by an advertiser. In the event that an End User elects to provide PII under such circumstances, we may collect such PII on behalf of such advertiser or its agency. We may use and share such information as described under “How Information is Used” below.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How Information is Used</strong>
        The information collected pursuant to this Policy may be used to provide purchasing opportunities and aggregate reports to advertisers, agencies and publishers who participate in the Yieldmo Service, to schedule, deliver and optimize advertisements, to create audience interest segments and categories, to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same browser or device (frequency capping), to provide advertisements only to certain types of mobile devices, to anonymously track sales and conversions, to detect and eliminate fraudulent activity, to administer and enhance the Yieldmo Service, and to help Yieldmo display, optimize, target and/or customize advertisements to the interests or preferences of End Users. The PII received pursuant to this Policy may be shared solely with the applicable advertiser or its agency on behalf of whom such information was collected. The End User should review the advertiser’s privacy policy to understand how the advertiser will process such PII. Yieldmo may use certain general health-related information in delivering advertisements based on inferred End User interest in these topics based on sites or ads with which the End User previously interacted. This may include information related to general health, wellness, common ailments and illnesses, beauty and fitness, but will not include sensitive health information (such as a user having a certain medical condition like cancer or diabetes). For example, a user who views content related to parenting might later be shown an ad for children's clothing or accessories. Similarly, a user who views content related to fitness might later be shown ads related to exercise-related apps. We may also utilize non-sensitive health-related targeting data segments provided by third party data companies. As an example, Yieldmo may use health-related segments from those third parties such as “Beauty, Health &amp; Fitness &gt; Health, Diets &amp; Nutrition” (Click here for a representative list of such health segments). We may share Non-PII with our affiliates, third party partners and agents. For example, we may share Non-PII to analyze the performance of advertisements, provide reporting to advertisers and clients, improve advertisement targeting on our platform, improve our products and services, and enable third party partners to improve advertisement targeting across their respective services and platforms.

      <h3 class="headline-cap">Security</h3>
      <p>Yieldmo uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII and Non-PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. To that end, we have designed and deployed hardware, software, and networking solutions in an effort to reasonably secure and protect access to our systems and data. Please note that where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access the Yieldmo Website or Yieldmo Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.</p>
