# Privacy Policy | YBS

When you make an enquiry or complete an application we will use your personal information including sensitive information, as appropriate, to process your enquiry, set up and administer the account and services you have with us. We will also use your personal information to contact you where necessary, for fraud prevention and detection, legal and regulatory compliance, market research and general business purposes. We will only process your personal information where we have a lawful basis to do so. We will only use your details for marketing where we have consent to do so. 

* ### Marketing

We will respect your right to privacy and only contact you if we have your consent, and we will only use methods you have agreed to. This may be post, face to face, email, text message, telephone or any other available messaging service. You can withdraw consent at any time and we will stop sending you details of our marketing offers.

If you change your mind at any time about the contact methods you have agreed to, just let us know by calling [0345 1200 100](tel:0345 1200 100) , visit your local branch or by logging on to your online account.

We do not contact children with details of products, services and offers, but we may send them birthday greetings. We will ask them for ID when they are 16 years old and ask them to choose whether they want to be kept informed of products, services and offers.

If you subscribe to one of our special customer services e.g. our Savings Pledges—to be kept informed of new savings accounts by email, we will use these details for this service until you unsubscribe from this service and these details will be removed. These services are not linked to and do not affect the marketing permissions and other details you have registered with us. We will not sell your details to other organisations but may use marketing agents to act on our behalf.

* ### Our relationships with other organisations

We will share relevant information with associate companies, agents and service providers to administer the service provided such as assessing suitability, products taken, payment of commission, complaints and to manage our customer relationship with you.

If we offer you products or services from other organisations and you take these products you will be entering into a contract with the organisation concerned. These contracts safeguard the security and confidentiality of your information, and restrict further use by the organisations for their own purposes. All organisations we work with are assessed for adequacy of their security controls.

* ### Site monitoring

We use technical methods (called "cookies") to identify what stage in an application process you are at, improve your experience by making it quicker and easier for you to use the site, identify how effective our advertising is and provide you with information in the future we believe is relevant to you. No personal information is captured unless you proceed with an application at which point details of where your enquiry originated will be linked to your customer record. You can block or delete cookies from this site in your browser settings. To find out more about cookies please see our cookies section below. By doing this your experience may be affected and parts of this site may not work. By continuing with an enquiry/application you will be consenting to the use of cookies as explained.

* ### Communication

All communications with us may be monitored/recorded to improve the quality of our service, staff training and for your protection and security.

* ### Email

You should note that ordinary email is not secure. Please do not send us any confidential information via email. Similarly, we will only use email to send confidential information about your accounts to you where we are required to do so, where you specifically request it, and where it is suitably protected.
