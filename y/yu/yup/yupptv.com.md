Examples of personally identifiable information may include your name; email address, phone number, user name, password. mailing address, and other information such as payment or credit card information. We may also collect other information when you access our Site. “Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual.

The information gathered by YuppTV may also include information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as the User navigates through YuppTV’s sites and/ or uses the Services. An agent or affiliate of YuppTV may, at times and on being so authorized, collect information on behalf of YuppTV. Third party providers featured on or linked to by the YuppTV sites, such as vendors of products and services offered through the sites, may be gathering the same kinds of information. 

Any personal information or video content that the User voluntarily discloses online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. The Users account name (not the email address) is displayed to other Users when any videos are uploaded or messages are sent through the Services and other Users can contact the User through messages and comments. Any videos that the User submits to the YuppTV sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public. 

    * How YuppTV Responds to Do Not Track Signals: 

We may partner with third-party service providers to serve ads regarding goods or services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Site and third party-sites. Some of the ads on this Site or on third party sites may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your computer’s browsing activity on both the Site and third-party sites. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags). 

The Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet advertising companies, including information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by their members. See [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) for general information about the NAI and <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> for the opt-out page. You may also visit <http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/> to learn about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out from ads served by some or all participating companies. 

These opt-out mechanisms rely on cookies to remember your choices. If you delete your cookies, use another computer or device, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this process. In addition, opting out of interest-based ads will not opt you out of all ads, but rather only those ads that are personalized to your interests.
