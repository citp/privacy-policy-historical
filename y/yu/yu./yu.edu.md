                                   Yeshiva University Site Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy governs your use of the yu.edu network of web sites that post or link directly to this
Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Site”). Yeshiva University and/or one or more of its constituent schools
(Yeshiva University and its constituent schools, collectively, “YESHIVA” or “we” or “us”) publishes
and maintains the Site. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with Personal
Information (as defined below) that we collect through the Site. By visiting the Site, you agree to the
terms of this Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time. This Privacy Policy is
incorporated into, and part of, the Site’s Terms and Conditions which also governs your use of the Site.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain,
other than through our Site, such as by phone, through postal mail and through other live and print media.
In addition, to the extent that you submit any Personal Information to any third party (for example, via a
third party software application or service that is included in the Site), the third party’s collection, use and
disclosure of such information may be governed by its privacy policy, and not by our Privacy Policy.
YESHIVA is not responsible for the information collection, usage and disclosure practices of third
parties.
Purpose
Your privacy is a serious matter to us. This Privacy Policy explains, in general, what Personal
Information and other information is collected on our Site, how the information is used, and with whom
we may share such information. Please take a few minutes to read our Privacy Policy so that you
understand how YESHIVA treats your information.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
YESHIVA has a policy to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (aka “FERPA”).
Our FERPA policy is available for your review
What Information is Collected on the Site?
In order to make your use of our Site as worthwhile as possible, we may gather three basic types of
information through the Site: Personal Information, Non-Personal Information and Internet Protocol
Addresses.
         Personal Information
Personal information is any information that identifies you as an individual and includes, for example,
name; address; photos; e-mail address; telephone, wireless and/or fax number; short message service or
text message address or other wireless device address; instant messaging address; or credit card number.
You do not have to provide Personal Information to use the Site. However, in order for you to take
advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site, we may require that you provide Personal
Information.
We collect Personal Information from users of our Site, through users’ activities, transactions and
completion of online forms such as when users register or subscribe for accounts or features on our Site,
make online donations, order event tickets, complete surveys, join online communities, create profile

pages, upload photographs, contribute to open forums that we may make available on or through our Site,
submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on our Site, send us an e-mail,
or in any other way submit Personal Information to us via our Site.
         Non-Personal Information
When you visit and interact with the Site, YESHIVA and its third-party service providers may collect
Non-Personal Information (for example, a catalog of Site pages you visit). Non-Personal Information is
generally collected through the Site from different sources: (i) cookies; (ii) clear GIFs and similar
technologies; (iii) environmental variables; and (iv) information that you voluntarily provide.
                 Cookies
We and our service providers may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.
Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and
stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's
computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most websites,
and can facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of a particular website; cookies do not cause damage to
your computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies,
there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be
given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular
website, to your computer. To learn more about cookies, please click http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
                 Clear GIFs
We and our service providers may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar
technologies, in the Site and/or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have
visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image
(although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of
message, which is used to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and e-mail recipients, to
determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and
response rates.
                 Environmental Variables
We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as your MAC
address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and
Internet browser version. These environmental variables are collected by most Web sites, and can be
used to optimize your experience on the Site.
                 Information That You Voluntarily Provide
YESHIVA also collects Non-Personal Information (e.g., demographic information, your interests, your
geographic location) when you voluntarily provide such information to us. This information is Non-
Personal Information because, unless combined with Personal Information, it does not personally identify
you or any other user. Additionally, we may aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the
end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using Personal
Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such
aggregate information is considered Non-Personal Information for purposes of this Policy.

         IP Address
Our servers automatically collect data about your server’s Internet address when you visit us. This
information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that’s automatically
assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you’re on the Internet. When you
request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our
server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine);
the pages you visit on this Site; the Web site you visit after this Site; other information about the type of
Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have
entered on this Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers.
We and our service providers use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose
problems with our server, and to administer our Site. Such information may also be used to gather broad
demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.
How do we use information collected?
                  Personal Information
We will use the Personal Information you provide to our Site, for example, to fulfill your requests for our
programs and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other programs
or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We sometimes use this information to communicate
with you, such as to notify you when we make changes to our services, to fulfill a request by you, to
process transactions or to contact you about your relationship with us. We may also use your Personal
Information for internal business and record keeping purposes. We may send you notices (e.g. in the
form of e-mails, mailings), and otherwise correspond with you, about programs and events, sponsored by
us and others, that we think might interest you. You may opt out of receiving certain notices from us by
following the instructions in the Choices section below.
                  Non-Personal Information
Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use such information for
any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share Non-Personal Information with third parties for
any purpose.
In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information or IP Addresses with Personal
Information (such as combining your name with your geographic location). If we do combine any Non-
Personal Information or IP Addresses with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information
as Personal Information as long as it is combined.
How do we share Personal Information collected?
                  Public Forums
When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Site, such as a chat room, community, bulletin
board, list serve, personal Web page, calendar, news group, blog, wiki or other open forum that we may
make available on or through our Site, the information that you submit may be made available to the
general public. For this reason, we recommend that you exercise caution when submitting any sensitive
information, including your full name, home address, phone number, other information that would enable
other users to locate you, or financial information on these areas of our Site. Within many of these public
forums, YESHIVA provides you privacy options that allow you to restrict the use and viewability of your
Personal Information to others.

                  Third-Party Offers
We may provide visitors an opportunity to receive offers from other third-party entities that have services,
products and offers that we think might be of interest to you. Unless you elect not to receive such offers
by following the instructions in the Choices section above, we may from time to time provide your
Personal Information to these entities so that they may send you these offers.
                  Service Providers
We may use third-party service providers to help operate our Site and provide services including but not
limited to data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment and other services of an administrative
nature. We may share Personal Information about you with these third parties for the purpose of enabling
them to provide services to you or to us (for example, if you choose to make a purchase through the Site,
we may share your Payment Information or other Personal Information with our third party service
providers to fulfill your purchase, including, to process your credit card or payment account number or to
ship products to you).
                  Legally Compelled Disclosures; Emergencies
We may disclose Personal Information to others as we believe to be appropriate (a) where permitted or
required by applicable law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from
governmental or public authorities; (d) to enforce our Terms of Service; (e) to protect our operations; (f)
to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of YESHIVA, you or others; and (g) to permit us to
pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
                  Assignment
We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from Site users to a third party in
the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all
or any portion of YESHIVA’s operation or assets (including without limitation in connection with any
bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
Processing of Transactions
When you make a purchase or donation through the Site, we may collect your credit card number or other
payment account number (for example, your wireless account number), billing address and other
information related to such purchase (collectively, "Payment Information") from you, and may use
Payment Information in order to fulfill your purchase. We may also provide Payment Information, or
other Personal Information provided by you, to third parties as necessary to complete your transaction (for
example, to process your credit card or payment account number). To the extent that Payment
Information includes Non- Personal Information, use of Non- Personal Information is governed by the
section on Non-Personal Information below.
We also may use third-party payment services (each, a "Payment Service") to collect payments made
through the Site. If you wish to make a payment through the Site using third-party payment services, you
will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the Payment Service's service
providers) and not by YESHIVA (such page, the "Payment Service Page"). Any Personal Information
that you provide through the Payment Service Page will be collected by Payment Service and not by
YESHIVA, and will be subject to Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Policy. YESHIVA
has no control over, and shall not be responsible for, Payment Service's use of information collected
through the Payment Service Page.

Choices
You may have the right to make choices (“opt in” and “opt out”) of certain of our uses of your Personal
Information. For example, at the time you are requested to provide Personal Information on this Site, you
may have the opportunity to elect whether to receive certain types of correspondence from us, or to
whether your information will be shared with third parties for marketing purposes. You may also make
request regarding how your information is used by sending an e-mail to opt-out@yu.edu or by clicking on
an opt-out link within an e-mail you receive. Clearly indicate what choices you are making (electing not
to receive promotional communications message from Yeshiva or requesting that we not share
information with third parties for the third parties’ marketing purposes). Please understand that if you opt
out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your
relationship, activities, donations and communications with us.
Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove Personal Information
about you from the databases of third parties with which we have already shared Personal Information as
of the date on which we implement your opt-out request. If you wish to cease receiving marketing-related
e-mails from third parties, please contact the third parties directly or use any opt-out mechanisms set forth
in their respective privacy policies or marketing-related e-mails.
Wireless Addresses
If the e-mail address you provide to us is a wireless e-mail address, you agree to receive messages at such
address from YESHIVA (unless and until you have elected not to receive such messages by following the
instructions in the Choices section above). You understand that your wireless carrier’s standard rates
apply to these messages, and that you may change your mind at any time by following the instructions in
the Choices section above. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device
on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.
Access and Correction
If you would like to access Personal Information we have collected about you through the Website or if
you would like to update, correct or limit the use of any Personal Information you have provided to us via
the Website, please email us at webmaster@yu.edu.
For your protection, we will only implement such requests with respect to the Personal Information
associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to
verify your identity before implementing your request and consistent with applicable law. You must
clearly indicate the Personal Information that you wish to have changed, clearly indicate that you wish to
have your Personal Information or clearly indicate the limitations you wish to put on our use of your
Personal Information. We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, and there may also be residual
information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.
Security
While YESHIVA will use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect the
security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information provided to this Site, due to the inherent nature of
the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during
transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be
absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. Please do not send us sensitive information
through email.

You may be able to create an account on our Site with a username and password. You are responsible for
maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any
access to or use of the Site by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such
access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your
employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify YESHIVA by contacting us in accordance with
the "Contacting Us" section below of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other
breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. We will not
be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or
control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is
appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the
extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as
a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this
situation, please e-mail us at webmaster@yu.edu with the alternative contact information you wish
to be used.
Consent to Processing
By providing Personal Information to this Site, you understand and consent to the collection,
maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries
and territories.
Third-Party “Linked-To” Sites
When you are on our Site you may have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other sites not operated by
YESHIVA. (As an example, when you want to make a purchase from our online store, you link to a third
party Web site to place your order.) These sites may collect Personal Information about you. YESHIVA
does not control sites that are operated by these entities and is not responsible for the information
practices of these sites. This Privacy Policy does not address the information practices of those other Web
sites. If you provide any Personal Information through any such third party web site, your transaction
will occur on such third party’s web site, and the Personal Information you provide will be collected by
and controlled by the privacy policy of that third party.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
YESHIVA reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy, or any other of our policies or
practices, at any time, and will notify users of this Site by posting such changed or updated Privacy Policy
on this page. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to this Site. Under
certain circumstances, we may also elect to notify you of changes or updates to our Privacy Policy by
additional means, such as posting a notice on the front page of our Site to sending you an e-mail. You

above.
