					<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				</div>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
				Your privacy is of the utmost importance to Yuku. Our basic principles are: </p>

				<ul>
					<li>We respect your privacy at Yuku</li>
					<li>You control your personal information,</li>
					<li>We try to limit our collection of personal information as needed to provide and improve our services to you,</li>
					<li>We do not disclose your personal information to third parties unless we need to do so to fulfill your requests,
					you expressly tell us to, we believe we are reasonably compelled to do so, or we are required to by law.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
				Yuku is a network of collaborative publishing communities, user profiles and images. You the user and we as Yuku have entered a voluntary
				relationship in which we provide services to you. The data you disclose to us makes it possible to deliver the services you truly
				want and ask for.</p>
				<p>
				Yuku's services contain links to other web sites outside Yuku. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and⁄or practices of other sites. When
				linking to another site a user should read the privacy policy stated on that site. This privacy policy only governs information
				collected on Yuku.com.</p>

				<h2>What Information is Gathered</h2>
				<p>
				We collect information the information you give us when you become a member of Yuku.</p>

				<h3>Site Visitors</h3>
				<p>
				In general, you can browse parts of the site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about
				yourself. If you choose to use our services, we may
				require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, and other personal information as indicated on
				forms throughout the site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have
				the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature. Your failure or unwillingness to
				provide certain information may mean that a service or feature will not be available to you.</p>

				<h3>Browser and Other Information We May Collect</h3>
				<p>
				In addition to the information you choose to provide to us, Yuku also collects and stores certain technical and other
				information about the online activities of our users—whether or not they are registered—on an aggregated (or collective)
				basis. This may include your IP address, browser type, and operating system. We track the number of people who view each page, and
				other site usage data, in order to learn which features are the most popular and thereby improve our service. We also record
				statistical information collected on our site to better understand our audience. This information is recorded as anonymous group
				statistical information and is not connected to any personal information that you provide as a member.</p>
				<p>
				We, as well as the administrators of each domain, do have the ability to view your IP address if you post content within a domain
				on the network. We also collect the information that you provide when you make a post on one of our domains so that we can archive
				and display your posts. Please use caution when posting material on any domain as your posts may become immediately available to
				the public and may be recorded and stored by anyone.</p>

				<h3>Registered Members</h3>
				<p>
				When you register as a member, we ask you to provide us with a user name, password, e-mail address, name, address, birth year, and
				gender. We'll also ask you whether you'd like to participate in our business partners' programs.</p>

				<h3>Member Emails</h3>
				<p>
				As a registered member, you must choose to receive our system emails. System emails are used to contact you in the event of changes to our services, terms of use or privacy policies.  Yuku may use URL tracking in the emails sent to you.
				When you open such email messages, our system may record the following data: the time you viewed the email and the URLs that you
				clicked on from that email. Yuku will also record if your email program is capable of receiving HTML-encoded email. URL
				tracking may use cookies.</p>

				<h3>International Visitors</h3>
				<p>
				Like almost every Web site, Yuku may be accessed by an international audience. By visiting our Web site and providing us
				with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in this policy. In
				addition, such data may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction, which may have more or less stringent privacy
				practices than your own. By providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data.</p>

				<h2>How Information is Used</h2>
				<p>
				We understand that you value your personally identifiable information.  We generally use your personal information to render you
				services and to improve our services.</p>
				<p>
				We may use your personal and registration information to: improve our services; troubleshoot problems; measure consumer interest in our products and services; inform
				you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; protect us against error, fraud and
				other criminal activity; enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection and in this policy.
				At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems, and in particular we may examine your personal information to
				identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases.</p>

				<h3>Email Communications from Yuku</h3>
				<p>
				Yuku may send you messages through our messaging system to keep you apprised of your membership status, site
				developments, and to inform you of new offers.</p>

				<h3>Third Party Use and Partner Site Email Communications</h3>
				<p>
				In the interest of bringing the highest quality services to you "under one roof," Yuku has partnerships with other
				Web-based services. Some of these arrangements include the sharing of some of your personal information with our partners in order to
				extend these services to you. We only share information
				when you specifically authorize it.</p>
				<p>
				Yuku, as well as its partner sites, may send you e-mail messages on a regular basis to keep you apprised of your membership
				status, site developments, and to inform you of new offers. Examples of this include special offers from our business partners.
				Included in each of these messages are simple instructions on how to remove yourself from these mailings if you do not wish to receive
				them in the future.</p>

				<h3>Third Party Sharing to Render Services to You</h3>
				<p>
				We may use third parties to help us perform services, like processing credit card information, transmitting emails in response to your
				requests, or other service-related functions. If these third parties require access to your personally identifiable information in order
				to provide their services, they will be obligated to abide by this privacy policy when handling your information.  We require third party
				service providers to limit their use of your personal information to rendering services for us and you consistent with this policy.</p>

				<h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
				<p>
				Our business is about building a long-term relationship with you. To build that trust, we know that as you spend time on our site, your
				personal information must remain within your control. Be assured that your personally identifiable information, such as your name,
				address, and email address is not sold to others.</p>
				<p>
				There are some situations where we may need to disclose information to organizations or entities not described in our policy here.
				Yuku may be required to disclose your personal information: (i) if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal
				process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (ii) would
				potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit; (iii) is otherwise necessary to protect our rights or property;
				or that of others (iv) is necessary to protect the interest of other users of our web site.</p>

				<h3>Merger or Sale of Yuku</h3>
				<p>
				We may also transfer the information in our possession in connection with a sale of assets of the company, a sale of the company or a
				merger.</p>

				<h3>Respecting Others' Privacy</h3>
				<p>
				By agreeing to our Terms of Use, you agree that, with respect to other users' personal information that you obtain through the site or
				through a Yuku-related communication or Yuku-facilitated transaction, Yuku hereby grants to you a license to use
				such information only for: (a) Yuku-related personal communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) using services
				offered through Yuku, and (c) any other purpose that a user expressly agrees to after you tell them the purpose you would like
				to use it for. In all cases, you must give users an opportunity to remove themselves from your systems and a chance to review what
				information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this paragraph, can you disclose
				personal information about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of that user. You agree that other users
				may use your personal information to communicate with you in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
				<p>
				Yuku and our members do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add a
				Yuku member, even one who participates on our domain, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express
				consent. To report Yuku related spam to, please contact us using our legal form.</p>

				<h2>Security of Information</h2>
				<p>
				Your information is stored on Yuku's servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to
				protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy.</p>
				<p>
				That being said, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be
				guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Yuku cannot ensure
				or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own
				risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure the security of your information on our systems.</p>
				<p>
				Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software
				failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time. Therefore, although we use industry standard
				practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private
				communications will always remain private.</p>
				<p>
				If Yuku learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective
				steps. By using this web site or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding
				security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this site. Yuku may post a notice on our web site if a security
				breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the Yuku.com web site. Yuku may also send
				an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right
				to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from
				receiving electronic notice) you should <a href="mailto:legal@yukucorp.com">notify us</a>.</p>

				<h3>Cookies, Web Beacons and Personalization</h3>
				<p>
				"Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are
				only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session.
				Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests.</p>
				<p>
				Yuku uses cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record session information for purposes including: ensuring that
				visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements; to customize advertising and Web page content based on browser type and
				user profile information; to estimate and report our total audience size and traffic; and to conduct research to improve our content
				and services. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our
				site. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set—each
				browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences—however, you must
				enable cookies from Yuku in order to use most functions on the site.</p>
				<p>
				Please note that we permit third party advertisers who present advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on
				your computer. Advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Yuku Privacy Policy. For more
				information about their separate privacy policies, you should contact the third-party advertising network directly.</p>
				<p>
				Yuku uses web beacons to research certain usage and activities on its and our website. The information collected through these
				web beacons is used to find out more about our users; for more accurate reporting; and to improve the effectiveness of our marketing. No
				personally identifiable information about you is shared by Yuku as a result of this research.</p>
				<p>
				You agree that we may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to
				your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your
				use of the Site. By accepting the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information.</p>
				<p>
				Not only do you have the opportunity to post content on any of our public Yuku domains, but you also have the opportunity to
				create your own Profiles and Domain and tailor it to your own special interests. In order to create a community, you need to be registered as a
				member to do these things. Once you've registered, you can follow our instructions on how to create your Profiles and Domain and customize them to match your preferences.
				This means you get to decide how to structure your Profiles, Domain, what design you'll use, and more. If you no longer wish to operate your
				Yuku domain, you can delete your content and turn off the "allow replies" feature.</p>

				<h2>Children</h2>
				<p>
				We at Yuku believe it essential that parents are involved in their children's online experiences. That is why, in compliance
				with federal law, we do not knowingly collect personal information of any kind from anyone under the age of 13. If we become aware of a
				user under the age of 13 providing information on our site, we will terminate their account and purge our databases of all information
				provided by that user.</p>

				<h2>Access to and Changing Information</h2>
				<p>
				Once you become a member of Yuku, your personal information is stored in the site. You may access or
				change your information at any time.</p>

				<h2>Notice of Modifications</h2>
				<p>
				In the future, Yuku may update and revise its privacy policy. We will provide conspicuous notice on our website if we decide
				to change our privacy policy in a way that would be materially less restrictive than this policy. At that time, you will have the
				opportunity to decide whether or not you would like Yuku to apply the new privacy policy to your personal information or to opt
				out of the new policy. If you continue to use Yuku, you will be accepting the new policies. If you decide to opt out of the
				new policy, you will no longer be able to participate as a member. The effective date of this policy is Januaary 4, 2006.</p>
				<p>
				Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and⁄or any account information. Please
				be careful and responsible whenever you're online. The few employees who have access to personal data are trained to comply with the
				above privacy policy and made aware of any updates or modifications.</p>

				<h2>Questions?</h2>

				If you have any questions about this privacy policy still unanswered after reviewing this policy, please do not hesitate to contact us.
