  1. (a) _Account activity_. You need a Yuuguu Account to access Yuuguu. Yuuguu asks for some personal information when you create a Yuuguu Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A Yuuguu Account allows you to access many of our services that require registration. 

When you use Yuuguu, we may record information about your usage, such as when you use Yuuguu, the size of your contact list and the contacts you communicate with, and the frequency and size of data transfers. Information displayed or clicked on in the Yuuguu interface (including UI elements, settings, and other information) is also recorded.

  2. (b) _Content_. We will store the contents of text chats in your Yuuguu account.

  2. (b) On a regular basis, we delete activity information associated with your account.
  3. (c) When you use Yuuguu, people included in your contact list may be able to see your online presence, username, Yuuguu address, and any information that you choose to add to your profile, including images, links, and custom status indicators.
  4. (d) We may relay content for users in some cases.



**3\. Your choices**

You may delete your contacts information or chat histories you have stored in your Yuuguu account by sending an email to [support@yuuguu.com](mailto:support@yuuguu.com "Email Yuuguu"). Because of the way we maintain this service, such deletion may not be immediate, and residual copies may remain on backup media.
