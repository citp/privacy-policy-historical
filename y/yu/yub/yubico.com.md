# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Yubico we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * In our products and services, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:  
If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please [contact us](http://www.yubico.com/support/contact/ "Contact").

Yubico AB (“Yubico”) operates several websites including yubico.com, store.yubico.com, forum.yubico.com and wiki.yubico.com. It is Yubico’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Yubico collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Yubico’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Yubico’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Yubico may release non- personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Yubico also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on forum.yubico.com and wiki.yubico.com. Yubico only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Yubico’s websites choose to interact with Yubico in ways that require Yubico to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Yubico gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for the Yubico forum and Wiki to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Yubico – by purchasing products at Yubico web store at store.yubico.com, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Yubico collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Yubico. Yubico does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. If you use a YubiKey with the YubiCloud, Yubico logs all validation requests. These logs are stored indefinitely and are required for business operations and security analysis.

## Aggregated Statistics

Yubico may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Yubico may monitor the most popular Yubico products and services to help identify use and improvements. Yubico may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Yubico does not disclose personally- identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Yubico discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Yubico’s behalf or to provide services available at Yubico’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Yubico’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Yubico will not rent or sell potentially personally- identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Yubico discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally- identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Yubico believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Yubico, third parties or the public at large. Please be advised disclosures can be made to businesses and organizations outside of the EU and EES area.

If you are a registered user of an Yubico website and have supplied your email address, Yubico may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Yubico and our products. We primarily use our web sites to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Yubico takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Yubico uses cookies to help Yubico identify and track visitors, their usage of Yubico website, and their website access preferences. Yubico visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Yubico’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Yubico’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If Yubico, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Yubico goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Yubico may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Yubico may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Yubico’s sole discretion. Yubico encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
