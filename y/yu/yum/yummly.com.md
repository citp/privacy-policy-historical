# Privacy Policy | Yummly

### Privacy Policy

[Yummly](http://www.yummly.com/ "Yummly.com") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of the Yummly website (this “ **Site** ”) and the Yummly application (the “ ** _Application_** ”) (collectively the “ ** _Services_** ”).  This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Services.  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site.  You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.  Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our [Terms of Service](http://http//blog.yummly.com/blog/terms/ "Terms of Service").

As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.

**Information Collection and Use**

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Services.

_Personally Identifiable Information_.  In the course of using the Services, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (“ ** _Personal Information_** ”).  Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, age, gender, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses.  We use your Personal Information mainly to provide our Services and administer your inquiries.  For example, when you create an account through the Services and become a  “Registered User” or when you choose to create your own profile webpage, we may ask you for Personal Information.

We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Yummly newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your “user preferences” information.  (See “ **Changing or Deleting Information** ,” below.)

_Registered Users_.  Once you become a Registered User, you will be able to create a profile page by submitting certain Personal Information.  The profile page will display your “screen name” as well as your profile picture, if you choose to upload one. You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile including but not limited to your age, gender, and hometown.  .  Providing such information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with other Yummly users.  Only other Registered Users will be able to see your profile page.

_Non-Identifying Identifiable Information_.  We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage ( _e.g._ , without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences, such as viewing and/or food preferences) (“ ** _Non-Identifying Information_** ”).  Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified.  But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).

We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Site and Services are used.  We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver information to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

Application Usage Information.  When you use the Application, our servers will automatically record information that your mobile device sends or transmits, including, but not limited to, the model and device ID number of your mobile device, user settings, location and information about your use of the Application (“ ** _Application Usage Information_** ”).  We only store, track and monitor general usage and not information specific to any user.  We use this information provide and improve the Services, develop new products, and offer products and services that may be of interest to you.

_Log Data_.  When you visit or use the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“ **Log Data** ”).  This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“ **IP** ”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.  We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Services and for the Site’s technical administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs.  For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.  We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.  We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.

_Cookies_.  Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your search preferences and Personal Information and registration ID and login password for future use of the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you leave or log off from the Site and Services and then close your browser.  Third-party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services.

Aggregate Information.  We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information, Application Usage Information and Log Data with third parties (including suppliers, advertisers, research companies and other organizations) for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes.  Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.

Service Providers.  We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Services are used.  These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.  Yummly cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Yummly or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

Business Transfers.  Yummly may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

**Changing or Deleting Your Information**

All registered users may review, update, correct or delete their Personal Information by contacting us or by making the appropriate modifications in your user account preferences through the Site and/or Application. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated.  If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record.

**Security**

Yummly is very concerned with safeguarding your information.  We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.  We will make any legally required disclosures of any  breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

**International Transfer**

Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Yummly transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

**Links to Other Sites**

Our Site contains links to other websites.  If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website.  The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.  We do not exercise control over third party websites.  These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.  Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

**Our Policy Toward Children**

This Site is not directed to children under 13.  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.  If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, contact us and we will delete such information from our files.  If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

**Contacting Us**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@yummly.com or at:   320 High Street, Palo Alto, CA 94301.

Effective April 16, 2010
