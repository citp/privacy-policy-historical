In order to provide you with special services (e.g. automatic pre-selection of your country-specific VAT), this website uses a geolocalization software developed by MaxMind, Inc. (14 Spring Street, 3rd Floor, Waltham, MA 02451, USA). This software analyzes IP addresses to determine your approximate location. Geolocalization is carried out exclusively on the basis of anonymous IP addresses. An exact location determination of the website visitor is hereby excluded.

3\. Website analytics 

3.1. Google Analytics 

3.1.1. This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, Ca 94043, USA). The use shall be made on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 letter f. GDPR. Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website, such as browser type / version, operating system used, referrer URL (the previously visited page), host name of the accessing computer (IP address), time of the server request, is usually transferred to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google. We have also added the code “anonymizeIP” to Google Analytics on this website. This guarantees the masking of your IP address so that all data is collected anonymously. Only in exceptional cases the full IP address is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. 

3.1.1.1. We have enhanced the IP address masking ("anonymizeIP") feature on this website for both, our Google Analytics and Google Analytics integration, into your Yumpu Analytics account. 

3.1.1.2. IP address anonymization has been developed by Google to enable this website to comply with applicable data protection laws and the recommendations of local data protection authorities when they prohibit the storage of the full IP address. If you use Google Analyitcs for your magazines or your account, anonymous data will also be transmitted to you. IP anonymization or masking takes place as soon as the IP addresses arrive in the Google Analytics data collection network and before the data is stored or processed. More information on IP anonymization can be found at [ https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en ](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en) . 

Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide us with other services relating to website activity and internet usage. You can prevent the storage of cookies by making the appropriate setting in your browser. We would like to point out, that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this website to their full extent.

As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile devices, you can prevent Google Analytics from capturing data (see 3.1.3).   
Further information on data protection in connection with Google Analytics can be found in the Google Analytics help (<https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en>). 

3.1.2. Google Analytics reports on demographic characteristics and interests: We’ve turned on advertising reporting in Google Analytics.

This enables us, to get a better picture of our users without assigning this data to individual persons.

To do this, Google stores a number in the browsers of users who visit certain Google services or websites on the Google display network.
