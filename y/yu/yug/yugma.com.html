	<h3 id="WhatisYugmaandwhy">1. What is Yugma and why is my information needed?</h3>
          <p>Yugma is an online managed service that allows users to collaborate on documents, deliver presentations, perform product demonstrations, collaborate on shared documents and securely share confidential information from anywhere, anytime. Because Yugma is Web based, it requires the use of first and last names, billing contact information, a password and a valid email address as a login. Therefore, at a minimum, we require such necessary information during the registration process.</p>
         <div align="right" style="margin-right:10px"><a href="#top"><img src="/images/back-to-top.png"></a></div>

          <h3 id="WhatinformationdoesYugmagather">2. What information does Yugmagather/track and how is it used?</h3>
          <p>PERSONAL INFORMATION: Because of the nature of our product, we must collect personal information from users during the registration process, including (at minimum) first and last names, an email address to be used as a login, billing contact information and a password. Your email address may be used to send you periodic newsletters from Yugma and it may be used by us on the behalf of third-party advertisers, but only upon your express consent.We use the information collected to deliver services, process payments, update our records, communicate with you about products and services and generally maintain your accounts with us.Yugma in-session information is end-to-end encrypted and only accessible by the authorized meeting organizer and participants. "In-session information" includes all screen sharing data, keyboard/mouse control data and text chat information. This information is never exposed in unencrypted form while temporarily resident within Yugma communication infrastructure servers or during transmission across public or private networks. Information about scheduled meetings and prior meetings such as subject, organizer name, and meeting time is stored on our website and is available to the meeting organizer and authenticated users that have received an invitation from the organizer via email, instant messenger, phone, or other communication method.Because of our commitment to present the best possible product to all our users, we track the category of services selected by our individual users as well as all information pertaining to user satisfaction. To ensure the quality of our product, we reserve the right to maintain evaluation and feedback records.</p>
          <p>BUSINESS INFORMATION: Information that is provided by meeting organizers or administrators such as meeting schedules, attendee lists (participant name, email address and any other business contact information requested by the meeting organizer) and meeting subject name is considered confidential to the purchaser or co-sponsor of the meeting event. You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit while in-session and utilizing the chat feature can be read, collected or used by the meeting organizer and other meeting participants. We will not view Business Information except as necessary to appropriately support the service. We will only use the Business Information provided for the purpose of anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that might limit or disrupt the quality of your Yugma experience.</p>
          <p>PARTNERS: In some cases we provide services or sell product lines jointly with other businesses. For these co-branded offerings in which a third party is involved in your transactions, we will sometimes share or jointly collect customer information related to those transactions with that third party. On the co-branded registration pages we will state who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs its use so that you will know at the time you create your account exactly how your information will be used. If you are registered with Yugma through a partnership and you request to opt out of receiving promotional updates, in order to comply with the provisions in the Can Spam Act, we will also provide your email address to that partner so that they may also discontinue sending you messages on behalf of Yugma.</p>
          <p>SESSION RECORDS: To maintain our quality of service and to assist in the analysis of product performance, we may also gather data on connection information, including the timing and size of all packets sent over the Internet during a session. The gathered information is used only to ensure the highest quality experience possible at Yugma.</p>
          <p>SECURITY INFORMATION: Yugma also collects certain standard information about your computer for security and identification purposes. This information may include: IP addresses, domain names, access times, cookies, and other uniquely identifying information of machines that have the Yugma software downloaded and installed. This information is used for the operation of the service, to identify and protect our customers and to control unauthorized use or abuse of our services. All information is encrypted during transmission and is stored securely within our servers.</p>
          <p>SURVEYS: In addition to required member information, we may conduct surveys and ask users to volunteer demographic information to be used on an aggregate basis for internal market research, presentation to advertisers and joint research projects with outside companies involved in product development. We use such information to better focus our product and personalize the scope of services offered to each individual user. Such information will not be passed to third parties without your prior consent unless where required by applicable law.</p>
          <p>TRAFFIC PATTERNS: We also track aggregate traffic patterns throughout our site. However, we do not correlate this information with personally identifiable data about individual users.
