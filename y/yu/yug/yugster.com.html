	<strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>
	At Yugster we realize that privacy is important to all of our customers. This statement outlines how we care for your privacy.</p>
<p>
	<strong>BY ACCESSING THIS SITE YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT.</strong></p>
<p>
	E-mail communications: When you register or order at Yugster, you also agree to receive the Yugster emails where we offer great offers on products from Yugster. We never share, sell or rent your information with anyone else.</p>
<p>
	All communications from yugster contain simple removal instructions.</p>
<p>
	All emails from Yugster are Can-Spam compliant.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>
	Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person.</p>
<p>
	You may be asked to provide your personal information when you register or make a purchase with yugster.com.</p>
<p>
	Here are some examples of the types of personal information yugster may collect and how we may use it.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<strong>What personal information we collect:</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you purchase a product we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information. We do not store your credit card information, it is passed to our payment gateway provider though a secure link.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you share your content with family and friends, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to join you, yugster may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How we use your personal information:</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Yugster’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and advertising. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences. There is a link to do this in every email we send you.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with yugster, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>
	We also collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where a product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also may collect information regarding customer activities on our website. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
	If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cookies and Other Technologies</strong></p>
<p>
	Yugster's website, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
	Yugster may also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with us more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit. Knowing your country and language helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.</p>
<p>
	If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the Security pane to disable cookies. For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.</p>
<p>
	As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>
	We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Yugster may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.</p>
<p>
	In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the yugster website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.</p>
<p>
	Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Disclosure to Third Parties Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>
	Yugster shares personal information with companies who provide services such as fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you and providing customer service. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever yugster operates.<br>
	Protection of Personal Information</p>
<p>
	Yugster takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
<p>
	Yugster uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is collected. To make purchases from us, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it’s transmitted over the Internet.</p>
<p>
	When you use the yugster community site, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.Children</p>
<p>
	We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.<br>
	Third-Party Sites and Services</p>
<p>
	Yugster websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third-party coupon or product offer. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<strong>International Users</strong></p>
<p>
	Information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. Yugstere abides by the “safe harbor” framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected by organizations in the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Learn more about the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program.<br>
	Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy</p>
<p>
	To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Yugster employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.</p>

                      <h2>Five Things Americans Are Blowing Money on in Grocery Stores</h2>
                      <p>
	There are more and more gourmet foods at the stores these days. Many seem over-the-top expensive in these budget-concsious times. Here are a few that are growing very quickly.</p>
<p>
	Truffles and Truffle Oil</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="/ckeditor_assets/pictures/125/content_1e7eb8d9-cb4e-4ccf-9d7e-71f26290e597_12152011_food_truffle1_slideshow.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 235px;"></p>
<p>
	You may have noticed more truffle-infused products and dishes popping up on menus and store shelves lately. Truffles are fragrant mushroom-like fungi that are difficult to cultivate and whose locations are highly guarded secrets. “Truffle product sales like truffle oil and truffle salt are up 10 percent from last year,” says Lily Hodge, public relations director of D’Artagnan, an online purveyor of gourmet foods. The prized Alba White truffles, which are available only a few months out of the year in a remote part of Italy and must be foraged by special pigs, are selling for about $3,000-$3,500 per pound.<br>
