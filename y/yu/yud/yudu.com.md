##### Overall privacy statement

Our websites are designed to allow authors/editors/publishers (collectively, 'Authors') a wider distribution of their work, to the benefit of interested readers ('Readers') by making them available on the internet. Anyone who accesses our sites, whether as an Author or a Reader, is regarded as a 'User'. Yudu Ltd may differentiate between Authors and Readers with respect to the gathering, use and sharing of User information, but for purposes of this Privacy Policy each User should assume that the entire Policy applies to such User. 

We take User confidentiality and privacy seriously. Because we gather certain types of information about our Users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.

Unless you have registered for one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you. 

We use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: 

  * Keeping count of return visits to our sites;
  * Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on Web-site and advertisement usage;
  * Determining which features our overall user population likes best;
  * Saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites;

  * We may hire third-party vendors to provide specialized services, who are only allowed to use the information to do their jobs, and not for their own use.
