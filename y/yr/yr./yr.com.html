<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
<p>We may use information obtained from cookies or similar technology. Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are stored by your computer or device when you visit our website. Therefore, when we refer to "you" in this section we mean your computer. We can recognize these cookies on subsequent visits and they allow us to remember you.</p>
<p>Cookies come in many forms. We have set out below the main types and categories of cookies that are used. This section refers to all types and categories of cookies and not just those we use on our website.</p>
<p><strong>First and third-party cookies</strong> - whether a cookie is first-party or third-party refers to the domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user, the website displayed in the URL window e.g. <a href="http://www.yr.com/" target="_blank">www.yr.com</a> . Third-Party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website this would be a third-party cookie.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> – these cookies remain on a user's device for the period of time specified at the time the website requested the cookie to be set. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.</p>
<p><strong>Session cookie</strong> – these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.</p>
<p><strong>What do we use cookies for?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies can fall into one or more of the categories. This website uses cookies which may fall into the following two categories set forth below. </p>
<p><strong>1. Strictly necessary cookies – These cookies enable services you have specifically asked for.</strong></p>
<p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies certain services you have asked for cannot be provided. </p>
<p><strong>2. Performance cookies – These cookies collect information on the pages visited.</strong></p>
<p>These cookies collect information about how users use a website, for instance which pages users go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages.  Such cookies may include third party cookies provided by Google and Yahoo analytics.  All information these cookies collect is aggregated and not used by us to identify individual users. They are only used to improve how the website works.</p>
<p>If you want to delete any cookies that may already be on your computer or device, please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies.  If you want to stop cookies being stored on your computer in future, please refer to your browser manufacturer’s instructions by clicking “Help” in your browser menu.  Further information on cookies is available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. By deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our website.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Third Party Websites</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our website may link to third party sites which we do not operate or endorse. These websites may use cookies and collect your information in accordance with their own privacy policies. This privacy policy does not apply to third party websites and we are not responsible for third party websites.  Such third party websites may include websites of companies who are affiliated with Y&amp;R, but have their own privacy practices and disclosures.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media Sites</strong></p>
<p>Our website may use links or tools from social media services, such as a “Like” or “Share” button.  We do not control such services or how they use your information.  By using such features you acknowledge that Y&amp;R is not responsible for how such social media services track you or use your information and you will be subject to the applicable social media provider’s privacy practices and disclosures.</p>
<p><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
<p>We take appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information disclosed to us is kept secure, accurate and up to date and kept only for so long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is used. </p>
<p><strong>Under 13 year olds</strong>This website is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from or about any person under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years old and wish to ask a question or use this website in any way which requires you to submit your personal information, please get your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>How to obtain a copy of your information </strong></p>
<p>You are entitled to ask for a copy of the personal information we hold about you (for which we may charge a small fee) and to have any inaccuracies in your personal information corrected. Please contact us using the details set out below.</p>
