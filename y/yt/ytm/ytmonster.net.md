We are the Data Controller for Master Data that you enter creating and maintaining your profile, which includes, but is not limited to, your username, password, email address, and the registration of your IP address.

We are also the Data Controller for the information passed on to other services. Danish data protection legislation regulates our collection of your information together with GDPR.

4\. Links to other websites

Our Site contains links to other websites. Our inclusion of such links does not imply our endorsement any of those websites. We do not control the content of these Third Party websites and assume no responsibility for the Third Party or their policies or practices.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these Third Party websites as their personal data collection, handling and processing procedures may differ from ours.

5\. Data processors and transfer of personal data outside the EU

We use external companies to maintain the technical operation of our Site and our services. These companies are Data Processors for the personal data for which we are Data Controllers. By accepting this Policy, you agree that we may also allow the information you are the Data Controller of to be processed by these Data Processors.

We have entered into Data Processing Agreements with the Data Processors, and it follows from these agreements that they must act exclusively in accordance with our instructions. By accepting this Policy, you authorize us to give such instructions to Data Processors to process information in accordance with this Policy when using our Site.

The Data Processors have taken reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information from accidental or illegal destruction, loss or deterioration, and to protect the information against disclosure to unauthorized persons, abuse, or other treatment in violation of data protection laws. At your request - and possibly against remuneration at the Data Processors’ current hourly rates for such work - the Data Processors must provide sufficient information to you to demonstrate that the above mentioned technical and organizational security measures have been taken.

Some of these Data Processors are located outside the European Union, such as in the United States. You consent to use Data Processors in insecure third countries, provided there is a legal basis for the transfer of your personal data, ensuring adequate protection of them, for example if the Data Processor is part of the EU-US Privacy Shield scheme.

We keep the Master Data and other personal information you provide, including your campaigns, for as long as you have an Account or necessary to provide our services to you.

Although you close your Account, we will in certain cases choose to keep some information (such as visits to our Site) in an anonymous or aggregated form.

7\. Safety precautions

We use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect your personal information in our organization, and we regularly review our system for vulnerabilities. But since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee or guarantee the security of the information you send to us. Emails sent through the Site may not be encrypted and we therefore advise you not to include any confidential information in your emails to us. We always work to improve our security procedures and we update this information as these practices evolve over time.
