<strong>Section 5. How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technology?</strong>
<br><br>
A "cookie" is a small file containing your preferences that is sent to your browser and sent back by your browser each time your browser accesses our servers.  When you visit our Services, we may send your computer or mobile device a cookie that uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies that we may use may only be read by the server that placed them there.  Our use of cookies is primarily focused on improving the quality of our Services and your use of those Services.  By way of example, we use cookies to deliver our Services in your language of choice, to filter results and fulfill other preferences you may have, and to analyze how our users, including you, interact with our Services, such as by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search.  Many browsers are set up to accept cookies unless the user changes the settings for cookies.  You have control over this and can set your preferences to indicate when a cookie is being sent or to refuse altogether. While you maintain control over your cookie setting, some portions of our Services may not function correctly without cookies.  You can review more information about cookies and how to control and delete cookies in various browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Chrome, please <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/">click here</a>.
<br><br>
We may currently or in the future use web analytics companies to assist us in measuring the effectiveness of our Services. This requires that we allow such web analytics companies to include their own Web beacons and cookies on the Services. These web analytics companies collect information from Web beacons and cookies such as click-throughs by users and other similar information. We use this information to help us learn things like overall user preferences, click-through rates, means to improve our Services, and what the types of offers that are of most interest to our users. We control how that data may be used, notwithstanding its collection by third party web analytics companies.
