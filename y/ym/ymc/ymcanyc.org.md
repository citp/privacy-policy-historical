We encourage you to ask questions and to be cautious before you disclose your personal information to others.

This Privacy Policy will explain the following regarding use of our site:

What information does the YMCA collect from you?  
In order to better provide you with services, the YMCA collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with the information that you request in a timely and efficient manner and therefore you experience a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our Website.

Personally Identifiable Information

We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties to charge your credit card, fill your order, and provide customer service.  For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We review the actions of the YMCA visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences.

The Personally Identifiable Information collected by the YMCA is used to process orders, registrations, reservations, pledges; to administer our systems; for statistical purposes; to improve our site and its performance; and to keep you informed about your order status.  We will release the information to third parties to charge your credit card, provide customer service, and deliver promotional e-mails to you from the YMCA.  We must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment.
