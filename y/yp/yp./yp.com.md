 **Information DexYP and Non-DexYP Family Companies Collect, Store, and/or Share**

 **What information does This Website gather, store and/or share?**

When you visit This Website, Dex Media may collect, store and/or share the following types of information:

  * Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide
  * Personally and Non-Personally Identifiable Information DexYP Collects Automatically
  * Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide



 _Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide_. DexYP collects and may store and share personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For example, DexYP may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number). If you purchase a product or service, DexYP may ask you to provide additional information such as your credit card information. DexYP will not share credit card information or social security numbers. In some cases (for example, if you register with us or sign-in on This Website or purchase a product or service) DexYP may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, security question and answer, and birthday.

If you choose to use an available referral service on This Website (e.g., to send a postcard, listing, page link, contest invitation, etc.), we may ask for certain personal information about the recipient (e.g., the recipient’s name, address, e-mail address, mobile telephone number) and your name and e-mail address. DexYP uses the personally identifiable referral information you provide to facilitate this communication and may also store and use such personally identifiable information for analysis and business development purposes of DexYP or its third party vendors. You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide.

 _Personally and Nonpersonally Identifiable Information Automatically Collected_. In addition, as you (and other users) browse This Website, our web servers, and third party vendors with which DexYP has an agreement governing our relationship (also known as non-“DexYP Family” companies), may automatically collect, track, store and share certain information about such visits, usually through the use of browser cookies, JavaScript files and tagging, web address tracking codes, file impression counts, “web beacons”, and the analysis of http headers (“Tracking Methods“). These Tracking Methods provide information that may be personally identifiable information, such as the user’s IP address, the user’s domain name, the user’s browser type, the user’s user agent, which pages the user visits and for how long, the date and time the user accesses This Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to This Website, the links on This Website on which the user clicks, and how many users visit This Website. In addition, DexYP may collect certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user, but which parameters are not directly entered by the user in a search bar.

DexYP may also collect, store and share information, including personally identifiable information, related to your usage of third-party sites that you access through This Website.

 _Non-Personally Identifiable Information You Knowingly Provide_. In some cases, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information that you provide, such as search parameters you enter in connection with a search you conduct through This Website, ratings and reviews or other content you post, business listings you bookmark or save, and zip code.

To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand This Website’s capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.

 **How does DexYP use, store and share information collected on This Website?**

 _Specific Purpose_. When users supply personally identifiable information about themselves for a specific purpose (for example, to register to use a feature on This Website, to purchase a product or service, to obtain a free listing, to register for a program or to use a feature of a program, to receive information, or to apply for a job), we may use, store, and/or share such information for such purpose as well as to analyze and improve services provided by DexYP.

 _Similar to Information Collected in Traditional Non-Electronic Manner_. We also may use, store and/or share personally identifiable information users provide as we would use, store and/or share the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use such personally identifiable information to assess your credit rating when you request payment terms from us. We may also use store and/or share this information to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), to contact you in connection with a program you are participating in, your user reviews or any claims we get that content you posted violates a third-party’s copyright, and/or to evaluate your service needs, to analyze and improve services provided by DexYP, and to contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a feature on This Website, we may also use, store and/or share such personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of such feature. (For example, if you register to use the personalized directory service, we may use the personally identifiable information you provide to provide you with a more personalized and useful service, and if you create a review of a business on This Website, we may publish your initials, user name, profile picture (if you provide one), city and state in connection with such review.) When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion that we may run on This Website, we may use, store and/or share such information to administer such contest, sweepstakes or promotion and to notify winners.

 _Communicate with You_. We may also use, store and/or share personally identifiable information you provide or that is automatically collected to communicate with you (e.g., to send you e-mails or text messages) and to otherwise serve you. For example, we may use your name telephone number and e-mail address to call or send you texts or e-mails to (a) provide information regarding our company, marketing information about our products and services or the products and services of other companies, and newsletters, (b) conduct online surveys, (c) confirm your registration on This Website, a service registration, or orders placed online and (d) otherwise communicate with you. However, you may request not to receive (i.e., “opt-out” of receiving) commercial text and e-mail messages (the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service) from us (on a category-by-category basis). Email opt-out or unsubscribe is described in the section titled, Can I review and request changes to personally identifiable information that I provide through registration forms on This Website?. Your personally identifiable information may also be used, stored and/or shared by non-“ DexYP Family” companies, with which we have agreements, to provide you information about their products and services.

 _Protect DexYP’s Property or Other Rights_. In addition, DexYP may use, store and/or share personally identifiable information you provide and information DexYP automatically collects through This Website (and may combine personally identifiable information you provide with information DexYP automatically collects through This Website and non-personally identifiable information you knowingly provide) as it deems appropriate to protect its property or other rights (for example, to enforce any policies or contractual provisions regarding use of the “ratings and reviews” feature or the “send a listing” feature).

 _Improve This Website, DexYP Services and Targeted Advertising_. We use, store and/or share information DexYP automatically collects through This Website to improve This Website, to improve the services DexYP provides or may want to provide, to monitor its performance, to make This Website easier for you and other users to use, to manage features and programs made available through This Website and to provide behavioral tracking data to non-“ DexYP Family” companies, with which we have agreements, for the purpose of presenting you with, among other things, targeted advertising on third party websites. For example, DexYP may use information DexYP automatically collects in the ways described in the section entitled **“What is a cookie and why does DexYP use them?”**, below.

 _Mobile Advertising._ We use information DexYP automatically collects through the Mobile Products to improve our mobile products, to monitor such products’ performance, to make Mobile Products easier for you and other users to use, to analyze and manage features and programs made available, now and in the future, through Mobile Products.

 **Can I review and request changes to personally identifiable information that I provide through registration forms on This Website?**

 _Create and Update Profile_. If you use an available capability on This Website to register with us and create a profile, at any time after you register and create a profile, you may review and request changes to any personally identifiable information you provided through the registration form, by viewing and updating your profile within the application. If you use an available capability on Mobile Products to register with us, you may review and request changes to any personally identifiable information you provided through <https://www.dexknows.com/user/login> or <https://www.superpages.com/profiler/login_import.jsp> or <https://accounts.yellowpages.com/login>, as applicable.

DexYP may place its own advertisements, and/or accept advertisements from third parties that serve advertising, on This Website. DexYP may use its own Tracking Methods or Tracking Methods provided by such third parties in the pages containing the ad(s) that DexYP sends to your browser. These Tracking Methods allow DexYP and/or the third parties to automatically collect information (e.g., usage pattern information) about your visit to This Website.

As an online advertiser, DexYP may use information derived from its Tracking Methods or supplied from third party companies in several ways, such as to:

  * Evaluate and prioritize site selection when developing online media plan
  * Geographically target advertising
  * Deliver product and pricing advertising/information applicable to the customers’ state
  * Gauge the effectiveness of our online advertising



 **Security**

 **What security measures are in place to restrict access to personally identifiable information?**  
DexYP is committed to protecting your personally identifiable information that you provide through This Website. This Website is protected with a variety of security measures such as change control procedures and physical access controls (and passwords, as applicable). We also implement other control mechanisms in an effort to help protect personally identifiable information that you provide through This Website from being lost, misused or altered inappropriately.

This Website supports 128 bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to transmit certain information (e.g., credit card information provided by the user and social security numbers provided by the user). SSL is a transport level technology for authentication and data encryption between a web server and a web browser. SSL sends data over the “socket”, which is a secure channel at the connection layer.

 **Cookies**  
**What is a cookie and why does DexYP use them?**

A cookie is a small data string our server writes to your device’s internal drive that contains your unique User ID for This Website. Cookies help us to identify new and returning users to This Website, analyze click-stream data, and track historical activity on This Website, which allows us to give you a more personalized, useful experience on This Website. Cookies may be placed by us, by a third-party that provides services to us, or a non-“ DexYP Family” company, with which we have an agreement.

Cookies help DexYP to enhance the user’s online, mobile experience and can be used to:

  * deliver the appropriate geographic message
  * manage frequency of ad exposure; avoid over delivery of the same message
  * tailor an advertisement or other content to better match your interests and preferences
  * ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the state in which you live
  * keep track of your order as you order services
  * understand advertising effectiveness
  * manage features and programs made available through This Website
  * collect anonymous traffic data



A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your device or computer. However, customers are free to delete website cookies. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your device or computer, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.

You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on This Website, such as ordering products or services, and, also in connection with personalized sections of This website, for example My Superpages. To disable cookies, follow your browsers instructions. To opt-out of the placement of behavioral tracking cookies, see “How to Opt-out of Behavior Tracking Cookies” below.

However, you need to understand that some websites/ad serving companies have the ability to reestablish your history even after cookie deletion, if you reenter the same site on another occasion, or some other site tracked by the ad serving company/network, and specifically provide personal data.

Deletion of cookies alone does not prevent ad serving companies from reestablishing history on a user. The user must either continue to decline cookies each time it reenters the site to keep the tracking severed, if desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, your unique user ID cookie is erased and you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id cookie. This new cookie tells websites that you have opted out and they will then know not to attempt to assign other cookies to you in the future. Opt-out cookies do not contain a unique user ID number therefore websites are not able to identify your computer uniquely.

Users who choose to continually delete cookies and not opt out can have their browser advise them each time a website attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel a cookie. Users who choose to “opt out” after deleting cookies will receive an anonymous/non personally identifiable cookie.
