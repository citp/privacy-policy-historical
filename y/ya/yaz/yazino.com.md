The following statement details what information we obtain from you, how we use it and how we fulfill our obligations to protect your privacy. Please read it carefully. By using the Yazino site and its services, you will be agreeing that you are happy for Yazino to gather and use your information in the ways stated in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.

At Yazino we like to ensure that we will continue to meet the demands of our customers.
