# Privacy Policy - Boats Group

At Boats Group, we appreciate your use of and contributions to our websites, our mobile and desktop applications, our other properties and/or our related services (collectively known as the “Services,” or, each individually, a “Service”). Boats Group respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information.

Your privacy is important to us.  To better protect your privacy, Boats Group and/or our applicable subsidiaries and/or affiliates (collectively, “Boats Group”, “us”, “our” or “we”) provide this Privacy Policy, which explains our information practices and the choices you can make about the way in which your information is collected and used on this website, any other website operated by us where this policy appears or is otherwise accessible by you (for instance, via links from the website) and/or via any software applications we have created and made available for your use on your mobile device(s) (such websites and applications are, collectively, the “Services”).  (Some of our Services may also be governed by separate or additional privacy policies.)  Please see our [Terms of Use](http://www.boatsgroup.com/terms-of-use/) for additional information applicable to your use of our Services.

We encourage you to read this privacy policy to understand the information we collect and how we use and disclose it. This policy applies to all of our Services that link to it.

**1.) Information Collected by Boats Group.**

When you use the Services, we collect a variety of information from and about you, your devices, and your interaction with the Services. Some of this information identifies you directly or can be used to identify you when combined with other data.

  * **Information you provide.** When using the Services, you may be asked to provide personal information about yourself, such as your name, contact information, payment information, details about you or inventory you are interested in, financial information. This may occur, for example, when you register on the Services, share or save a listing, correspond with an industry professional (such as a dealer or broker) via the Services, or complete other forms or transactions, such as a request for loan information or an application. You may also provide information about a third party through the Services, for example, if you share a listing with a recipient via email. We may combine this information with other information we collect from your interaction with the Services or from other companies.



Some information you provide through the Services is collected and processed by third parties on our behalf. For example, when you order products or services through the Services, we may need to collect your credit or debit card information. This information is collected and processed by third-party payment processors. In the event that a credit report is required to use a Service, you may be asked to provide your Social Security number (“SSN”) or local equivalent. When SSNs are required, we use technology to pass that information directly to the third-party providers who need the information to process the credit or background check report. If you are a Service professional, you may be able to connect your third-party email account (such as Gmail) to your Boats Group CRM account. If you enable that connection, Boats Group will access your messages, contacts, and settings to provide the requested Services to you.

  * **Cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies.** We, and our partners, use various technologies to collect information automatically when you access and use the Services, including cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. Cookies are bits of electronic information that can be transferred to your computer or other electronic device to uniquely identify your browser. When you use the Services, we, and our partners, may place one or more cookies on your computer or other electronic device or use other technologies that provide similar functionality. We, and our partners, may use cookies to connect your activity on the Services with other information we store about you in your account profile or your prior interactions on the Services to, for example, store your preferences. The use of cookies helps us improve the quality of the Services to you, by identifying information which is most interesting to you, tracking trends, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, or storing information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis, such as your favorite homes.  At any time, you may adjust settings on your browser to refuse cookies according to the instructions related to your browser. [Cookie Management](http://www.yachtworld.com/core/globalnav/cookies.jsp)  However, if you choose to disable cookies, many of the free features of the Services will not operate properly.



The pages on the Services may also include web beacons or pixels, which are electronic files. This is to: count users who have visited that page; track activity over time and across different websites; determine users’ interactions with emails we send; identify certain cookies on the computer or other electronic device accessing that page; or to collect other related information. This information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier, or Internet Protocol address. We may, for example, implement a pixel on the pages of the Services where you view a certain advertisement so that we can track whether you visit a website associated with that advertisement at a later time.

  * **Third-party cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies.** We work with service providers and advertising networks to track and manage cookie information and your activities while you’re using the Services and your online activities over time and across different websites and devices.

You will be notified at the beginning of a call if it may be recorded or monitored.
