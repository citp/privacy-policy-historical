</p><h3>Information Collected:</h3> <blockquote> YachtWorld.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  YachtWorld.com collects information at several different points on this Web site as discussed below: <p> </p><h2>Personal Boat Shopper:</h2> To keep Site Visitors informed with respect to new listings of boats on the Web site we offer the Personal Boat Shopper feature, which is an e-mailing list service. In order to provide this e-mailing list service we collect e-mail addresses from Site Visitors who want to participate in the Personal Boat Shopper. The provision of information in the form of e-mail is not optional if a Site Visitor chooses to participate in the e-mailing list service.  <p></p> <p> </p><h2>Sell Your Boat:</h2>  In lieu of selecting a broker to list their boat for sale, Site Visitors selling a boat and desiring to attract the attention of an interested broker can provide some basic information about the boat they are selling for subsequent viewing by Members in the Members-only site, www.boatwizard.com. To list a boat to attract a Member, Site Visitors must complete the requested forms. By virtue of these forms we collect a limited amount of personal information such as: (i) name, and (ii) postal and e-mail addresses. The provision of this personal information is not optional and by not submitting the requested information, Site Visitors will not be able to attempt to post their information through this Web site.

The Member may designate this information as required or optional. we may keep a copy of these communications for systems management, tracking and reporting purposes, we have no control over what is done with the information collected by the Member through the Member's website.<p></p> <p>

Cookies also help us review site traffic patterns and improve the site.<p></p> <p> </p><h2>Web Beacons:</h2>  We set a web beacon (a single-pixel invisible image) on web pages and some of our HTML-formatted emails. We may use web beacons for a number of purposes, such as to count visitors to our web pages, to monitor how our Site Visitors navigate our site, or to count how many newsletters or emails we sent were actually opened.
