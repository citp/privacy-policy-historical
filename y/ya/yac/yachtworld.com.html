</p><h3>Information Collected:</h3> <blockquote> YachtWorld.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  YachtWorld.com collects information at several different points on this Web site as discussed below: <p> </p><h2>Personal Boat Shopper:</h2> To keep Site Visitors informed with respect to new listings of boats on the Web site we offer the Personal Boat Shopper feature, which is an e-mailing list service. In order to provide this e-mailing list service we collect e-mail addresses from Site Visitors who want to participate in the Personal Boat Shopper. The provision of information in the form of e-mail is not optional if a Site Visitor chooses to participate in the e-mailing list service.  <p></p> <p> </p><h2>Sell Your Boat:</h2>  In lieu of selecting a broker to list their boat for sale, Site Visitors selling a boat and desiring to attract the attention of an interested broker can provide some basic information about the boat they are selling for subsequent viewing by Members in the Members-only site, www.boatwizard.com. To list a boat to attract a Member, Site Visitors must complete the requested forms. By virtue of these forms we collect a limited amount of personal information such as: (i) name, and (ii) postal and e-mail addresses.
