# Privacy Policy - Yamaha - Other European Countries

## Your Privacy

At Yamaha we believe that, as our online visitor, you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we collect when you visit our Web sites and what type of information is collected. The guidelines contained herein only apply to your visits to the Web sites operated by the European subsidiaries of Yamaha Corporation Ltd.

Other sites which are linked to/from this site (including other Yamaha affiliates and via banner ads) may have different policies; therefore, please review the privacy policy notices on those sites for details. 

While Yamaha does not generally require that you provide us with personally identifiable information in order to visit and use the Yamaha sites, please note that in order to participate in some activities, it will be necessary for you to provide this information. If you choose not to provide it for those activities, you may not be able to participate in them.

## Collection of Information: Cookies; Personal

For each visitor to an Yamaha Web site, Yamaha's Web server automatically recognizes and stores information such as the visitor's IP address/Domain name combination. We use this information to understand visitor traffic patterns through our sites for purposes such as enhancing its usability. Your computer provides this information automatically each time you log on, unless you've activated blocking technology available in some browsers.

Additionally, Yamaha may ask you to provide "personal information", meaning individually identifiable information that you provide on our Web sites such as your email address, name, mailing address, telephone number, social security number, credit card number, or persistent identifier (such as a customer number held in a cookie) which is associated with individually identifiable information, to enable you to participate in contests, chat rooms, on bulletin boards, to fill out a registration, or to order products and services using these sites. Yamaha may combine the information you provide on our Web sites with other information we may collect from you or from third parties so that we can more effectively tailor our site, services and offerings to you. If you provide Yamaha with personal information, you shall have the right, on reasonable prior notice, to inspect, change, amend or delete such information. Instructions on how to update personal information will be given at the point of data collection.

Unless you instruct us otherwise, Yamaha may contact you to provide information about products, services, promotions, contests, or other activities or offerings that may be of interest to you. You can instruct us whether or not you wish to be contacted by checking or removing the check from the box indicating your preference as applicable at the place where your information is collected, or by other means (such as an email request). In addition, with each communication you receive from Yamaha, you will be given the opportunity to indicate if you do not wish to receive future communications.

Unless it is for the purposes you have requested or originally agreed, Yamaha will not share the personal information you provide on the Yamaha Web sites with any other parties, except (a) with your consent, (b) as may be permitted or required by law or court order and/or (c) to persons or companies with whom Yamaha contracts to carry out the internal operations of the site or our business (for example, to send you a promotional item that you have requested on the site).

Additionally and with your consent, Yamaha may share your personal information with other affiliated Yamaha companies (i.e., (i) Yamaha Corporation, (ii) any company of which more than 50% of its outstanding shares are owned by Yamaha Corporation, directly or indirectly, or (iii) any company with the name "Yamaha" as a part of its trade name) who may want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you. Further, only with your consent, Yamaha may share your personal information with specific third parties outside of the Yamaha group of companies who may want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you. Please consult the respective privacy policies of each of these companies for further clarification as to their own privacy policy. Yamaha will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-out" or "opt-in" method, or by other means (such as an email request). If you consent to receiving communications from any of these affiliated Yamaha companies, or third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications. Until we advise you, except as indicated above for the initial decision made with your consent to share your personal information with Yamaha affiliates and/or specific third parties outside of the Yamaha group of companies, changes or amendments to your personal information must be given both to Yamaha and to each such Yamaha affiliate or other company directly as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will not be exchanged among Yamaha and other Yamaha affiliates or third parties.

## Security

While Yamaha cannot guarantee that unauthorized access will never occur, rest assured that Yamaha takes great care in maintaining the security of your personal information and in preventing unauthorized access to it through the use of appropriate technology and internal procedures.

## Policy Governs Use; Changes to Privacy Policy

The terms of this policy will govern the use and any information collected while it is in place. Yamaha reserves the right to change this policy at any time, so please re-visit this page as often as you wish. Changes to this privacy policy are effective at the time they are posted to this site.
