            you for visiting the Privacy Policy page of Yamaha Motor 
            Corporation U.S.A.'s ("Yamaha") website. Yamaha 
            values your right of privacy, and wants you to feel comfortable 
            using its website at <a href="http://www.yamaha-motor.com" class="pagelink">http://www.yamaha-motor.com</a> (the "Yamaha Website" or "Website"). 
            This page describes our privacy policy for the Website, 
            and enables you to opt out of certain uses and disclosures 
            of your personally identifiable information. </p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>1. Your Acceptance</b><br>
            By using and/or visiting the Yamaha Website, you signify 
            your assent to both the content of this Privacy Policy and 
            the general Terms and Conditions for using the Website, 
            which are published at <a href="http://www.yamaha-motor.com/corporate/gen_terms.aspx" class="pagelink">http://www.yamaha-motor.com/corporate/gen_terms.aspx</a>, 
            and which are incorporated herein by reference. If you do 
            not agree to any of these terms, you should not use the 
            Website. Should Yamaha make any substantial change to this 
            Privacy Policy, we will publish an amendment, or we may 
            email you if you have not opted out of email notifications.</p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>2. Yamaha Website</b><br>
            This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Yamaha Website, 
            which may contain links to third party websites that are 
            not owned or controlled by Yamaha. For instance, if you 
            apply for Yamaha Factory Financing or establish a Yamaha 
            Card Account, you may access the independent website of 
            HSBC  Bank Nevada, N.A.  or another third party. Yamaha 
            has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, 
            the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third 
            party website, which may collect both passive and personally 
            identifiable information. In addition, Yamaha will not and 
            cannot censor or edit the content of any third party site. 
            By using the Website, your expressly relieve Yamaha from 
            any and all liability arising from your use of any third 
            party website. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware 
            when you leave the Yamaha Website, and to read the terms 
            and conditions and privacy policy of each other website 
            that you visit.</p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>3. What Type of Information Do We 
            Collect and Use?</b><br>
            When you visit the Yamaha Website, we may collect passive 
            information about your visit. Passive information is any 
            form of aggregate data, navigational data, tracking data, 
            click-stream data, or historical data, which does not on 
            its own personally identify you. Passive Information includes 
            information collected through cookies and web beacons. When 
            you register a product, apply for extended service through 
            our YES program, send us an email, subscribe to one of our 
            newsletters, or submit other data through the Yamaha Website, 
            we may also obtain and collect personally identifiable information. 
            Personally identifiable information is information collected 
            online that personally identifies you, such as by name, 
            email address, or mailing address. Yamaha provides you with 
            the ability to "opt-out" of certain uses of such 
            personally identifiable information. </p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>4. Maintenance &amp; Opt-Out of Information</b><br>
            If you wish to opt-out of our use and disclosure of your 
            personally identifiable information, other than as expressly 
            permitted in this Privacy Policy, you will have the option 
            to do so when you first submit your personally identifiable 
            information via the Yamaha Website. Simply state your desire 
            to opt-out where indicated. If you wish to amend or delete 
            any personally identifiable information that you have previously 
            provided without opt-out, please send us a message at <a href="mailto:privacy@yamaha-motor.com" class="pagelink">privacy@yamaha-motor.com</a>. 
            We will endeavor to provide a simple way to review, correct, 
            update or remove personally identifiable information you 
            have given us. If you wish to stop receiving a Yamaha newsletter 
            or other circulation, please follow the "unsubscribe" 
            instructions contained in each newsletter.</p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>5. How Do We Use Personally Identifiable 
            Information?</b><br>
            If you have opted out of our general use of personally identifiable 
            information, Yamaha will not use or disclose such information 
            except as follows:</p>
          <p class="commontext">- to communicate directly with you in 
            connection with your specific requests;<br>
            - to validate credit card numbers;<br>
            - to permit our website designers to develop features and 
            services that meet your needs;<br>
            - to tailor your experience on our Website, showing you 
            individually tailored content;<br>
            - to comply with a lawful subpoena or court order;<br>
            - to remedy any violation or breach of an agreement between 
            you and Yamaha; and<br>
            - to prevent harm to the property or rights of Yamaha or 
            its customers.</p>
          <p class="commontext">If you have not "opted-out" 
            of our use and disclosure of your personally identifiable 
            information, Yamaha may also use such information for its 
            own marketing and survey purposes, and Yamaha may appoint 
            third party agents in connection with such marketing and 
            survey efforts, subject to a confidentiality agreement concerning 
            the information. Yamaha will not, however, disclose any 
            personally identifiable information for use in connection 
            with a third party's marketing efforts.</p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>6. Aggregate Information</b><br>
            Yamaha may share aggregate statistical information with 
            business partners, sponsors or other third parties, but 
            none of them receive personally identifiable information. 
            For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of 
            visitors visited a certain area on a website, or that Y 
            number of men and Z number of women applied for extended 
            service, but we would not disclose anything that uniquely 
            identifies those individuals.</p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>7. Unsolicited Emails Received by 
            You</b><br>
            Yamaha does not send unsolicited bulk emails to anyone who 
            has requested that we do not contact them. We send newsletters 
            only to those who have taken affirmative steps to subscribe. 
            If you have inadvertently received one of our newsletters, 
            or if you simply wish to stop receiving them, please follow 
            the "Unsubscribe" instructions contained in each 
            newsletter or send a request to be unsubscribed to <a href="mailto:privacy@yamaha-motor.com" class="pagelink">privacy@yamaha-motor.com</a>.</p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>8. Cookies</b><br>
            Your browser software includes a feature called "cookies." 
            We may use "cookies" to enhance your experience 
            with our site. If enabled, cookies may store small amounts 
            of data on your computer about your visit to the Yamaha 
            Website, including your page preferences. Cookies tell us 
            nothing about you personally, unless you specifically give 
            us additional information. Yamaha does not merge or associate 
            our cookie information with any personally identifiable 
            information obtained by us or from third parties. Cookies 
            simply assist us in tracking which of our features you like 
            best and what content you may have viewed during past visits. 
            When you re-visit the Yamaha Website, cookies can enable 
            us to customize our content according to your preferences. 
            We may use cookies to: (i) keep count of your return visits 
            to the Website; (ii) accumulate anonymous, aggregate, statistical 
            information on website usage; (iii) deliver content specific 
            to your interests or past viewing history; and (iv) save 
            your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time 
            you visit our sites. You can also disable cookies. By modifying 
            your browser preferences, you can accept or reject all cookies, 
            or request a notification when a cookie is set. </p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>9. P3P (Platform for Privacy Preference) 
            Conformance</b><br>
            Our cookies conform to the emerging P3P privacy standard, 
            developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. P3P provides 
            a simple, automated way for users to control the use of 
            personal information. Browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer 
            6.0 conform to the P3P standard. At its most basic level, 
            P3P is a standardized set of multiple-choice questions, 
            covering all the major aspects of a website's privacy policy. 
            Taken together, they present a clear snapshot of how a site 
            handles personal information. P3P-enabled browsers can "read" 
            this snapshot automatically and compare it to the consumer's 
            own set of privacy preferences. P3P places privacy policies 
            where users can find them, in a form users can understand, 
            and, most importantly, enables users to act on what they 
            see. </p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>10. IP Addresses</b><br>
            An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a number 
            assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. 
            An Internet Service Provider ("ISP") typically 
            assigns a random dynamic IP address at the time of your 
            dial-up. For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, 
            or cable modem users, a static IP address may be permanently 
            assigned to a particular computer. Yamaha may record the 
            IP addresses of visitors to its Website. While an IP address 
            may reveal your ISP or geographic area, we cannot determine 
            your identity solely based upon your IP address. Other websites 
            you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses 
            of those websites and their pages, but these IP addresses 
            are never associated with Internet users.</p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>11. Web Beacons</b><br>
            The Website may contain web beacons, which are electronic 
            images (sometimes called "single-pixel gifs") 
            that allow us to count page views, or to access cookies. 
            We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters 
            containing graphics that we may send to opt-in subscribers, 
            to count the number of newsletters that have been opened 
            and read. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor, 
            or share any personal information about our website visitors. 
            They are used only to compile our anonymous, aggregate statistics 
            about website usage.</p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>12. Computer Profiles</b><br>
            Yamaha may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data 
            that helps us understand and analyze the Internet experience 
            of our visitors. For example, we may accumulate visitor 
            data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers 
            used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color 
            capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie 
            preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. 
            None of this information is personally identifiable and 
            we only share this information in the aggregate, reflecting 
            overall website or Internet usage trends, as outlined in 
            this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>13. Chat Rooms and Forums</b><br>
            The Yamaha Website may in the future include chat rooms, 
            forums, message boards, and/or news groups. If so, Yamaha 
            as a passive conduit will not be liable for any of the transmitted 
            information. Any information that is disclosed in these 
            areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution 
            before disclosing your personal information via these public 
            venues, which you do at your own risk. If you do so, you 
            may receive unsolicited emails or "spam." Yamaha 
            cannot safeguard the privacy of personally identifiable 
            information that is disclosed and can be viewed or accessed 
            online in this manner.</p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>14. Security</b><br>
            Some pages of the Yamaha Website use security measures to 
            protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information that 
            is transmitted through the Website. These pages use Secure 
            Socket Layer ("SSL") connections with 128-bit 
            encryption for certain transactions and confidential data. 
            When you use a secure browser, all information you submit 
            comes to us over the Internet in an encrypted form, with 
            a digital certificate issued by a third-party certification 
            authority such as VeriSign®. To view this certificate, 
            click on the image of the closed lock or the solid key on 
            the bottom bar of your browser window. We also maintain 
            our servers in locked facilities with secure access. Unfortunately, 
            no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network 
            can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while 
            we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, 
            we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information 
            you transmit, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive 
            your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its 
            security on our systems. You can report network abuse and 
            any risk of security violations to us by emailing privacy@yamaha-motor.com.</p>
          <p class="commontext"><b>15. Children's Online Privacy Protection</b><br>
            The Yamaha Website complies with the Children's Online Privacy 
            Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying 
            FTC regulation protects the privacy of children using the 
            Internet. Yamaha does not knowingly collect contact or personally 
            identifiable information from children under 13. The Yamaha 
            Website is not intended to solicit information of any kind 
            from children under 13, and is designed to block our knowing 
            acceptance of any such information, wherever age related 
            information is requested. It is possible that by fraud or
