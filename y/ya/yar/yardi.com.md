# Privacy Statement | Yardi Systems Inc.

## Privacy Statement

Yardi Systems, Inc. (“ **Yardi** ”) is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals and achieving and maintaining the trust of our clients (“ **Yardi Clients** ” or “ **Clients** ”). Central to this mission is providing a robust security and privacy program that carefully considers data protection matters across the suite of products and services offered by Yardi (“ **Yardi** **Services** ” or “ **Services** ”), including data submitted by Yardi Clients and their customers to our Services (“ **Client Data** ”).

### Web sites covered

This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices regarding information we collect from individuals (“you” or “your”) who visit www.Yardi.com and associated Yardi microsites and any other Yardi-controlled website that links to this Privacy Statement (collectively, “ **Yardi.com** ” or the “ **Site** ”). When we collect personal information on Yardi.com, certain additional disclosures, that are specific to the context of our collection and use of the information being collected (e.g. an event or seminar registration page), may be provided to you. For the avoidance of any doubt, we will adhere to those commitments and any such additional privacy policy statements are hereby incorporated into this Privacy Statement.

**IMPORTANT: THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO CLIENT DATA**. Yardi’s confidentiality/privacy and other obligations with respect to its Services, and Client Data, are governed solely by the agreements under which they are provided to our Clients. The traditional licensees of Yardi Services are residential and commercial real estate property owners and property managers (again, collectively, as used in this Privacy Statement, “Yardi Clients” or “Clients”). The other actors in the real estate economy are, of course, the residents, tenants and providers of various services for, or at, the buildings Yardi Clients own and manage.  Yardi Services (by means of example only, the Yardi Voyager web-based, fully integrated end-to-end platform product suite) help our Clients manage their real estate and other assets by, among other things, facilitating communication and transactions between Yardi Clients and their tenants and service providers. Yardi generally has no direct relationship with the individuals to whom our Clients’ Client Data may pertain; Yardi merely hosts or processes such data on behalf of our Clients. Any uses of Client Data by Yardi are done so pursuant to the subscription agreement in place between Yardi and the relevant Yardi Client, or Yardi’s applicable Terms of Service, which exclusively govern Yardi’s treatment of Client Data. This Privacy Statement does not apply to Yardi Services or Client Data. If you have any questions about the data practices of a Yardi Client, using Yardi Services to process your personal information, you need to contact the Yardi Client directly, and ask for their Privacy Policy or Privacy Statement. In other words, Yardi is a _data_ _processor_ and not a _data_ _controller_ with respect to Client Data. Yardi Clients make all decisions about how or why Client Data, containing personal information or not, is to be processed, including any disclosure or transmission to third parties. If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted or entered into a Yardi Service by or on behalf of a Yardi Client, or was otherwise collected by a Yardi Service on behalf of a Yardi Client, and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such Client Data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly. If an authorized Yardi Client requests that we update or remove the data in question and the Client has no ability to do so via use of the Services, we will acknowledge their request within 30 days.

### Web sites not covered

Some Yardi Services enable Yardi Clients to create websites and applications that run natively on the Yardi platform. One such example of Yardi Client websites that are created by Yardi Services are RENT _Café_ resident portals, which facilitate communication and transactions between Yardi Clients and their potential or actual renters. Such websites are controlled by Yardi Clients, and, as described above, any information submitted to or collected by such websites is Client Data to which this Privacy Statement does not apply. The terms of service and privacy policy of the third party Yardi Client governs such websites.

Yardi is committed to promoting privacy principles and providing as much information to individuals as legally and contractually possible about the processing of their personal information. In that light, some Yardi Client-controlled websites that are created and maintained by Yardi Services may include privacy statements directly from Yardi to the users of such websites. Yardi is committed to adhering to such privacy statements. We provide these statements, or disclosures to identify Yardi as the data processor/technology platform, to disclose Yardi’s privacy practices with respect to such Client Data, and to inform the user to seek information about the privacy practices governing the website directly from the corresponding Yardi Client. To be clear, Yardi’s privacy statements on such Yardi Client controlled websites are applicable only to Yardi, and not the Yardi Client. In such privacy statements, Yardi discloses how Yardi uses and processes the information collected by and submitted to the website controlled by the Yardi Client. For the avoidance of any doubt, if you submitted personal information to a Yardi Client-controlled website created and maintained by Yardi Services (e.g. RENT _Café_ resident portals) and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such Client Data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly.

Some websites hosted on the Yardi.com domain may be created and managed by Yardi Clients. Most of these websites are not accessible via the public internet. Regardless, please know that this Privacy Statement is not applicable to those websites, which are instead governed by the privacy statement of the Yardi Client that creates and manages the website. In addition, Yardi.com and other Yardi-controlled Sites may contain links to other third party websites. The information practices or content of such other websites is governed by the privacy statements of such other websites. Yardi encourages you to review the privacy statements of such other websites to understand their information practices.
