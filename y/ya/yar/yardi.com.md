# Privacy Statement – Marketing Resources

Yardi Systems, Inc. and its affiliated entities (“Yardi”) is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals and achieving and maintaining the trust of our clients (“Yardi Clients” or “Clients”) and other users of and visitors to Yardi websites (collectively, “Visitors”). Central to this mission is providing a robust security and privacy program that carefully considers data protection matters across the suite of products and services offered by Yardi (“Yardi Services” or “Services”), including data stored by Yardi on behalf of its Clients and their customers in connection with our Services (“Client Data”), as well as the personal data (including such data as defined by the EU General Data Protection Regulation) provided by Clients and Visitors who visit [www.Yardi.com](http://www.yardi.com/), associated Yardi microsites and any other Yardi-controlled websites that link to this Privacy Statement (collectively, the “Yardi Sites”).

**Web Sites Covered**

This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices regarding information we collect from individuals (“you” or “your”) who visit the Yardi Sites. When we collect personal data on the Yardi Sites, certain additional disclosures, that are specific to the context of our collection and use of the information being collected (e.g. an event or seminar registration page), may be provided to you. For the avoidance of any doubt, we will adhere to those commitments and any such additional privacy policy statements are hereby incorporated into this Privacy Statement.

**IMPORTANT: THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO CLIENT DATA**. Yardi’s confidentiality/privacy and other obligations with respect to its Services, and Client Data (as defined in the agreements for those Services), are governed solely by the agreements under which the Services are provided to our Clients. The traditional licensees of Yardi Services are residential and commercial real estate property owners and property managers (again, collectively, as used in this Privacy Statement, “Yardi Clients” or “Clients”). The other actors in the real estate economy are, of course, the residents, tenants and providers of various services for, or at, the buildings Yardi Clients own and manage.  Yardi Services (by means of example only, the Yardi Voyager web-based, fully integrated end-to-end platform product suite) help our Clients manage their real estate and other assets by, among other things, facilitating communication and transactions between Yardi Clients and their tenants and service providers. Yardi generally has no direct relationship with the individuals to whom our Clients’ Client Data may pertain; Yardi merely hosts or processes such data on behalf of our Clients. Any uses of Client Data by Yardi are done so pursuant to the subscription agreement in place between Yardi and the relevant Yardi Client, or Yardi’s applicable Terms of Service, which exclusively govern Yardi’s treatment of Client Data. This Privacy Statement does not apply to Yardi Services or Client Data. If you have any questions about the data practices of a Yardi Client, using Yardi Services to process your personal information, you need to contact the Yardi Client directly, and ask for their Privacy Policy or Privacy Statement. In other words, Yardi is a data processor and not a data controller with respect to Client Data. Yardi Clients make all decisions about how or why Client Data, containing personal information or not, is to be processed, including any disclosure or transmission to third parties. If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted or entered into a Yardi Service by or on behalf of a Yardi Client, or was otherwise collected by a Yardi Service on behalf of a Yardi Client, and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such Client Data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly. If an authorized Yardi Client requests that we update or remove the data in question and the Client has no ability to do so via use of the Services, we will acknowledge their request within 30 days.

**Web Sites Not Covered**

Some Yardi Services enable Yardi Clients to create websites and applications that run natively on the Yardi platform. One such example are RENT _Café_ resident portals, which facilitate communication and transactions between Yardi Clients and their potential or actual tenants. Such websites are controlled by Yardi Clients, and as described above, any information submitted to or collected by such websites is Client Data to which this Privacy Statement does not apply. The terms of service and privacy policy of the third party Yardi Client governs such websites.

Yardi is committed to promoting privacy principles and providing as much information to individuals as legally and contractually possible about the processing of their personal data. In that light, some Yardi Client-controlled websites that are created and maintained by Yardi Services may include privacy statements directly from Yardi to the users of such websites. Yardi is committed to adhering to such privacy statements. We provide these statements, or disclosures to identify Yardi as the data processor/technology platform, to disclose Yardi’s privacy practices with respect to such Client Data, and to inform the user to seek information about the privacy practices governing the website directly from the corresponding Yardi Client. To be clear, Yardi’s privacy statements on such Yardi Client controlled websites are applicable only to Yardi, and not the Yardi Client. In such privacy statements, Yardi discloses how Yardi uses and processes the information collected by and submitted to the website controlled by the Yardi Client. For the avoidance of any doubt, if you submitted personal data to a Yardi Client-controlled website created and maintained by Yardi Services (e.g. RENT _Café_ resident portals) and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend or delete such Client Data, please inquire with the Yardi Client directly.

Some Yardi Sites may be created and managed by Yardi Clients. Most of these websites are not accessible via the public internet. Regardless, please know that this Privacy Statement is not applicable to those websites, which are instead governed by the privacy statement of the Yardi Client that creates and manages the website. In addition, the Yardi Sites may contain links to other third-party websites. The information practices or content of such other websites is governed by the privacy statements of such other websites. Yardi encourages you to review the privacy statements of such other websites to understand their information practices.

Yardi, like all organizations, is a data controller of its employees’ personal data that is processed as part of its human resources operations.

Our legal basis for collecting and using the information and personal data described in this Privacy Statement will depend on the information or personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you.

**Public Forums and Customer Testimonials**

Yardi may provide bulletin boards, blogs or chat rooms on Yardi Sites. Any information or personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Yardi is not responsible for any information or personal data you choose to submit in these public forums.

**Information We Share**

**Compelled Disclosure**

Yardi reserves the right to use or disclose information and personal data provided on the Yardi Sites if required by law or if Yardi reasonably believes that such use or disclosure is necessary to protect Yardi’s rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.

**International Transfer of Information**

To facilitate Yardi’s global operations, Yardi may store, transfer and access the information and personal data you submit on the Yardi Sites around the world, including the United States, Canada and other countries in which Yardi has operations.

By registering to attend an event, contacting us through our web form or providing information or personal data to us on any Yardi Sites in any other context, you consent to the transfer of your information and personal data among these facilities, including those located outside your home country.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal data to recipients in countries outside of the EEA. In all such cases, we will only transfer your personal data if:

The country to which the personal data will be transferred has been granted a European Commission adequacy decision;

The recipient of the personal data is located in the U.S. and has certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework; or

We have put in place appropriate safeguards with respect to the transfer, for example the EU Model Clauses.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

As already stated elsewhere in this Privacy Statement, and in accordance with California Civil Code Section § 1798.83, please know that Yardi does not disclose personal data collected on the Yardi Sites to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

**Children Under the Age of 16**

Yardi Sites are not intended for children under 16 years of age. No one under age 16 may provide any information to, or on, any Yardi Sites.

**Rights of Individuals**

Visitors who wish to correct, update, change, or erase the personal data they submit on any Yardi Sites should be able to go back to the applicable registration page or web form to edit their user or organization record. However, some of the information voluntarily submitted that is not personal data, such as a response to a poll or a survey, is typically aggregated and thus not correctable, updatable, changeable, or erasable. For additional information or problems accessing your information from such page, call us at (800) 866-1124, or contact us using our [Privacy Feedback](https://www.yardi.com/about-us/privacy-statement/privacy-statement-feedback/) form.
