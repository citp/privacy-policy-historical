**Third Parties**

In order to serve you, we share your Personal Information with service providers or third parties that perform functions on our behalf. 

We may share your personal information with vendors or third parties who provide services to us, such as fulfilling orders, facilitating reservations, providing data processing and other information technology services, managing promotions, managing any rewards programs, surveys, contests, prize draws and sweepstakes, carrying out research and analysis, and personalizing individual Darden customer experiences. We do not allow these vendors to use this information or to share it for any purpose other than as allowed by law or to provide services on our behalf or on an aggregated basis for statistical, benchmarking, or other analytical services. 

As permitted by law, we also share information collected about you with companies with whom we have formal agreements to conduct analysis, engage in customer research, benchmarking, and to improve our products or services. 

We may, for strategic or other business reasons, decide to sell or transfer all or part of our business. As part of that sale or transfer, we may pass information we have collected and stored, including personal information, to anyone involved in the sale or transfer. 

**Compliance With Laws**

We may disclose your Personal Information and other information to third parties, including governmental authorities, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Darden, our customers, or the public as required or permitted by law (especially in emergency situations). 

##  Information collected via Cookies 

We use a variety of technologies, including cookies, to collect information about your online/mobile activity when you visit our Site(s). Cookies are small text files that a website server stores on your computer or device. They’re typically used to remember your account login preferences, monitor website traffic, provide customer support like live chat and help us better customize our site for your individual preferences. 

We may also use Flash® objects (sometimes called "Local Shared Objects") as part of our online authentication to help us recognize your computer when you come back to our site. We do not use Flash objects for any online behavioral advertising purpose. 

You can disable cookies by making the appropriate selection from your browser options to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set. However, if 

you choose to disable or delete cookies, you may limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our site. 

##  Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) on Third Party Sites 

There are three ways we use OBA on third party websites and mobile apps that are not affiliated with Darden. 

###  Interest‐Based Advertising 

The third parties we contract with may use cookies or other technologies to gather interest-based information to customize the ads you see. This information may be combined and linked with data from other sources. Neither the third parties nor Darden collects any personally information (PI) through these cookies. We may also use aggregate data to display ads or content that may interest you. 

Darden has adopted the use of the **AdChoices Icon** (also known as the Advertising Option Icon) on our interest-based advertising (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon). You can learn more about AdChoices by visiting <https://www.aboutads.info/choices/> to learn more and control whether or not you receive this type of advertising from participating companies. 

###  Device-Based Advertising 

We may also use device information, particularly in mobile advertising, to help deliver our ads and measure ad campaign effectiveness. Darden and the companies we work with may collect some certain information when you visit one of our sites or see our ads. Compiling and comparing this information creates a unique ID for individual devices and can be "matched" to the same information on other sites or mobile applications. Some companies we work with are also able to associate related devices into households based on common characteristics, such as IP addresses. 

###  Device Usage Research 

We may participate in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op. This helps us understand how you use our website and apps across your devices so that we can better tailor promotions to you. [Learn more about how Adobe’s program works and manage your preferences.](https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com/)

  * Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
