**About Yardbarker**

Yardbarker is a social media network for sports fans. The site lets people discover relevant sports content submitted by other community members. To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles, which display some personal information to other members and visitors. This allows our users to identify each other and expand their personal network of contacts. Yardbarker members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them.

Yardbarker cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at info@yardbarker.com.

User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes 

User Profile information including members' pictures, user names, and first names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the Yardbarker social networking community.

Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members. 

We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter, or news regarding the service, though users may choose not to receive email of this type.

From time to time, Yardbarker or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on Yardbarker. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply. 

**Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members**

Yardbarker members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Yardbarker stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. Yardbarker does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email address). Recipients of invitations from Yardbarker may contact Yardbarker to request the removal of their information from our database.
