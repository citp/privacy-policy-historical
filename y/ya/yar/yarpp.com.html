            <h1>YARPP.COM PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

            <p><b>Effective January 1, 2014</b></p>

            <p><b>This Policy may change from time to time. Please check back frequently for updates.</b></p>

            <p>Adknowledge EN, Inc., and its YARPP.com business operations ("YARPP", "we", or "us") respect and protect
                the privacy of consumers. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes what information we collect, how we
                use that information, and some of your privacy rights regarding that information.</p>

            <p><b>Collection of Information and Your Privacy Rights</b></p>

            <p><i>What information we collect and how we collect it.</i></p>

            <p>1.1 <i><u>Subscription or Survey Information.</u></i> YARPP collects information from you when you voluntarily provide
                it to YARPP or by others means,
                such as registration pages operated by third party publisher networks (collectively, a "User Form"). In
                a User Form, YARPP or a third party
                such as a blog or website (each such third party a “Publisher”) may ask you for your name, your
                company’s name, email address, street address,
                zip code, telephone numbers, and job title (together, "User Information").
                Completing the User Form is voluntary and you are under no obligation to provide User Information.</p>

            <p>1.2 <i><u>User Behaviors Collected with Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information.</u></i> YARPP uses cookie and web
                beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you, such as Internet Protocol
                address and what Web browser you are using, with certain of your online behaviors, such as opening or
                clicking on a particular online advertisement. Additionally, YARPP may use other new and evolving
                sources of information and information gathering in the future (together, "Technology Information").</p>
            <p>(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows
                YARPP and/or its partners to identify your IP address with corresponding information in YARPP's
                database. YARPP and/or its partners may use cookies to track individual responses or views of
                advertisements, and use this information to help predict what other advertisements may be of interest to
                you and enable you to receive customized advertisements or content. These cookies contain no personally
                identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data
                you voluntarily have submitted to us, such as your email address, that we may share with any third
                party, solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To learn about how you can opt-out of the receipt of
                cookies, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices. To learn about how you can remove cookies placed
                on your computer or prevent the placement of cookies on your computer, please see Section 4 below. To
                learn more about cookies in general, please visit http://www.cookiecentral.com.</p>
                <p>(b) Web beacons. A web beacon is programming code used to display an image on a web page and can also
                transfer an individual's or Publisher’s user identification to a database and associate the individual
                or Publisher with previously acquired information about them. Web beacons enable YARPP to track certain
                Web sites visited by consumers or advertisements you view online. Web beacons help determine products or
                services in which consumers may be interested and help track online behaviors for marketing purposes.
                More information about web beacons is available at http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html.</p>
                <p>(c) Where Technology Information is Collected. Technology Information is collected directly from YARPP
                advertisements and Publishers that YARPP contracts with to display advertisements. Such advertisements
                will usually be displayed within one of the following advertising vehicles:
                Websites. YARPP may set a cookie on a consumer’s computer when the consumer view advertisements
                delivered on Publisher websites. After a cookie is set, YARPP may track how consumers interact with the
                advertisement and the Publisher website (for example, registering, purchasing, browsing, etc.).</p>
            <p>1.3 <i><u>Email Databases.</u></i> YARPP and/or its partners may track Publisher and advertiser interaction with email
                solicitations sent to Publishers and advertisers (for example, to sign up for YARPP Pro).</p>

            <p>1.4 <i><u>Outside Information.</u></i> YARPP may lawfully receive information about you from third parties, such as
                information located in public databases ("Outside Information").</p>

            <p>1.5 <i><u>No Information Collected from Minors.</u></i> YARPP does not knowing collect personally-identifiable
                information about minors under the age of 18. MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 SHOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY PERSONAL
                INFORMATION, INCLUDING THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS, TO YARPP. If YARPP is notified it has personal information
                about a minor under the age of 18, that information will be promptly deleted from our database.</p>

            <p>1.6 <i><u>Individual Information.</u></i> As used herein, Individual Information means User Information, Technology
                Information, Outside Information, and any other information YARPP lawfully obtains about you.</p>
            <p><b>Use of Information and User Data</b></p>
            <p><i>How we use and share the information we collect.</i></p>
            <p>2.1 <i><u>Discretion to Use Information.</u></i> Information voluntarily provided to YARPP or lawfully obtained by
                YARPP is the property of YARPP and may be used by YARPP for any lawful purpose, including the sale,
                lease or transfer of the information to Publishers, advertisers and data aggregators for marketing
                purposes. If you wish to close your account or remove your email address with us, you may follow the
                instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe or follow the instructions detailed at
                Section 4 below.</p>

            <p>2.2 <i><u>Targeted Advertising and Information.</u></i> YARPP may use Individual Information to target advertising and
                other information, such as business, weather, entertainment, sports and general news alerts and similar
                information, more effectively. When an individual is online, YARPP may use Technology Information to
                associate an individual with their Individual Information and YARPP attempts to show information and
                advertising for products and services to which the person may respond. YARPP may use data collected from
                a response to one type of advertising or information for targeting advertisements or other information
                through a different venue. For example, YARPP may notice that you responded to a shampoo advertisement
                and use that response to deliver a shampoo-related advertisement and other information to you.</p>

            <p>2.3 <i><u>Legal Process.</u></i> YARPP may disclose Individual Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders and
                other legal process as required by law.</p>

                aggregated anonymous information about all persons or sub-groups of persons.</p>

            <p>2.5 <i><u>Business Transition.</u></i> YARPP may transfer all or part of your Individual Information as part of a
                business transition such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale.
                How we store and protect the information we receive.</p>

            <p>2.6 <i><u>Storage of Individual Information.</u></i> YARPP stores Individual Information in a database on YARPP
                computers; the information is maintained and stored in encrypted form. In addition, YARPP's computers
                have security measures, such as a firewall, to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the
                information under YARPP's control. YARPP also maintains physical and procedural safeguards to protect
                Individual Information. Notwithstanding such measures, YARPP cannot guarantee that its security measures
                will prevent these computers from being illegally accessed and the Individual Information on them stolen
                or altered.</p>
