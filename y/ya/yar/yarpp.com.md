**Collection of Information and Your Privacy Rights** _What information we collect and how we collect it._

1.1  _Collection of Information_. YARPP collects information from you when you voluntarily provide it to YARPP or by other means, such as registration pages operated by third party publisher networks (collectively, a "User Form"). In a User Form, YARPP or a third party such as a blog, website, or other third party working with YARPP (each such third party a “Publisher”) may ask you for information such as your name, your company’s name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, and job title (together, "User Information"). Completing the User Form is voluntary and you are under no obligation to provide User Information.

1.2  _User Behaviors Collected with Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information_. YARPP uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you, such as Internet Protocol address and what Web browser you are using, with certain of your online behaviors, such as opening or clicking on a particular online advertisement. Additionally, YARPP may use other new and evolving sources of information and information gathering in the future as they become available (together, "Technology Information").

(b) Web beacons.
