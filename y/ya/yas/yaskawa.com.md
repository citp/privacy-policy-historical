Privacy Policy 

**Privacy Statement  
**This privacy statement explains our policy regarding any personal information you may supply to us when visiting any Yaskawa web site, including other Yaskawa businesses websites. 

**Personal Information  
**There are times when we may need information from you; additionally some of our sites may require you to complete a registration form. Our goal in collecting this personal information is to offer you a more personalized browsing experience. When you let us know your preferences we will be able to deliver or allow you to access the most relevant information that meets your needs. 

To extend this personalization experience Yaskawa web sites may save information on your system in the form of a cookie. (For further explanation see 'cookies.') 

Yaskawa will not share e-mail addresses with anyone outside Yaskawa nor disclose user information to any third party, except to our Business Partners (see Business Relationships, below). 

This site gives you the option to remove your information from our database if you no longer wish to have this information used, as a basis for further contact with you. Please click on the following link to send your e-mail request,

**Contact Us**  
We use e-mail links, located on the 'contact us' page to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. This information may be filed and used to help us prioritize our development needs and continuously improve our web sites, to meet your needs. 

**Business Relationships**  
In working with our Business Partners, we require strict contractual obligations, which ensure that your information is safeguarded. Yaskawa sites contain links to other Web sites. Yaskawa is not responsible for the privacy practices, copyright or content of such Web sites. 

**Public Forums**  
We also make available: forums, message boards and news groups to our customers. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Cookies**  
_What is a Cookie?_  
A cookie is either a small text file that is stored on your hard drive, or some information that is stored in memory until you close your browser. Yaskawa web sites may save information on your system in the form of a cookie to allow: a personalized browsing experience, access to a secure implementation, or to better track usage of our web sites. 

There is some concern that cookies can access and read other areas of your hard drive, or that personal information about you can be read by the web site. Web pages that write and read cookies can only interact with the cookie file(s) for your browser and a cookie can only be accessed by the same domain server that sent it. In some cases, several Yaskawa sites may share a common cookie, but this is only possible because each of these sites end with yaskawa.com, and when we sent you the cookie, we stated that it could be read by any yaskawa.com web site. This saves you from having to re-enter the same information as you follow links between our different brand sites. 

_What's its purpose?_  
Some of our sites may allow you to register or choose personalization options so we can dynamically direct you to information on the web pages that suit your interest. By using a cookie, our site can automatically read your preferences and customize the pages without any action on your part. 

Other areas of our sites may require you to login. In this case your username may be stored in a cookie, so we can fill in the username field for you on subsequent visits, however we won't store your password in a cookie. Once you login you may be sent several cookies that will be stored in memory only. If you do not choose to accept these cookies, your access to any of the secured pages on our sites may not be personalized. 

_How does it help me?_  
Some of our statistics programs will issue you a cookie when you first come to our site and then use that information to allow us to gather more detailed information about activity on our site. Instead of using an arbitrary amount of inactivity time to signal the end of a visit, activity from the same cookie is considered a visit. We cannot determine your name, or other personal information from the statistics cookies. It does provide us with much better information about which areas of our sites are popular or not so popular, navigation routes etc. This information together with other customer feedback is used to help us prioritize our development efforts and continuously improve our web sites to meet your needs. 

Yaskawa recognizes our user's privacy concerns and will only use cookies as an enabling tool. You may choose to reject cookies either outright, or on a case-by-case basis using the instructions for your browser.
