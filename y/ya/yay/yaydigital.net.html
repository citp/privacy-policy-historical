<h3>THE USE OF COOKIES TECHNOLOGY</h3>

<p>A "cookie" is a small data file which is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. We use cookie technology to make your use of our Site and our Services more convenient and to support our internal business purposes.</p>

<p>Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to alert you every time a cookie is offered, letting you decide whether or not to accept it. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. If you continue to use our Site and Services without disabling cookies we will assume that you are willing to accept all cookies from our Site.</p>

<p>You can, of course, use and visit our Site with cookies disabled, but you will not automatically be recognised by the Site upon re-visiting. We therefore recommend that you visit our Website using "Essential Cookies" as described below.</p>

<p><u>Essential Cookies</u></p>

<p>We use cookies to identify you when you visit our Sites e.g. we use session cookies to recall your e-mail address so you don’t have to re-enter this information each time you visit. Cookies allow us to tailor your unique user experience.</p>

<p>Our Site may use technology such as web beacons, web bugs or clear GIFs to track and analyse non-personally identifiable usage information and to compile statistical information about our Users (e.g. their IP address, browser type, internet service provider etc.) in order to improve the Site's quality and to support our business.</p>

<p>You should note that We also use HTML5 localStorage technology to enhance your user experience. This technology operates in the same fashion as cookies technology and therefore we will use this mechanism to collect and store information as well as configure your experience in the same ways outlined above.</p>

</ul>

<h3>THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>We will use your Personal Information for our internal business purposes e.g. to:</p>

At times, we may need to employ external vendors, service providers and suppliers to assist us with e.g. processing credit card payments, fraud scoring and prevention, debt collection and telecommunications. These third parties may need access to your Personal Information as is reasonably necessary to perform their obligations; they are not permitted to use your Personal Information for any other reason.</p>

<p><u>Sharing with Affiliate Companies:</u> Where you permit us to, We, our affiliates and subsidiaries (where We have granted permission) may disclose to their affiliates and business partners certain Personal Information and other details of the use of our Services so our partners can send you their own Direct Marketing communications.

<p><u>Cleaned Data.</u> Periodically, we take steps to "clean" Personal Information provided to us, e.g. we may remove information which can be used to identify individuals anonymising, pseudonymising, summarising, aggregating or removing certain data elements.

We may also share your information to a third party if we participate in a merger, acquisition, reorganisation, restructure or other sale of some or all of our assets.</p>

<p>You should however note that if, due to a reorganisation or restructure, we become subject to a new owner, your information may be subject to the new owner’s policy. In these circumstances, you will be notified by e-mail or through an update of this Policy prior to the change.</p>

<p>We may also share your information to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</p>

<p>Be assured that, whilst we may share your information as indicated above, your Personal Information and other information will remain subject to and will be governed by this Policy at all times.</p>
