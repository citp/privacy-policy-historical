                      any third party without your permission, except as discussed

                    <p>We want you to feel safe and comfortable when you use our 
                      site and affiliated game sites, and we are dedicated to 
                      developing and upholding high standards for protecting your 
                      privacy and securing your Personal Information. You should 
                      read and familiarize yourself with this Policy and with 
                      the terms of use, if any, of our site and affiliated game

                    <p> <b>What Information We Collect and How We Use It: </b></p>
                    <p>YaYa collects Personal Information on a voluntary basis. 
                      You do not need to provide us with information about yourself 
                      to use many areas of our site and affiliated game sites, 
                      but in order to take advantage of some of our features you 
                      may need to register and/or provide other Personal Information 
                      before you can participate. </p>
                    <p><b>We will ask you for some Personal Information: </b></p>
                    <p>when you fill out the registration form for our site, <br>
                      when you register for specific promotions, and <br>
                      when you elect to use our referral service to inform a friend 
                      of our site. <br>
                      To register for our site, you will need to provide us with 
                      your name, e-mail address, zip code and date of birth. In 
                      the future, some of our features and tools may require you 
                      to provide us with additional information as well. We will 
                      use this Personal Information to contact you if necessary 
                      or, if you choose to receive e-mail from us, to send you 
                      newsletters and to inform you about special offers or events 
                      that might interest you. You always have the option to change 
                      your mind about receiving e-mail from us, to change the 
                      areas of interest about which you have requested information, 
                      or to change or update any of your Personal Information, 
                      by e-mailing us at unsubscribe@yaya.com or changes@yaya.com, 
                      respectively, and submitting the appropriate changes. </p>
                    <p>In addition, in order to enhance your experience at our 
                      site and affiliated game sites and on the worldwide web, 
                      we keep abreast of third parties who provide products or 
                      services that we believe may be of interest to you. As part 
                      of our business, we have also entered into, and may in the 
                      future enter into, agreements whereby we license our games 
                      and products to companies, many of them prominent, which 
                      are seeking to enhance their presence on the worldwide web 
                      in order to benefit their customers. We may choose to provide 
                      these third parties with some or all of your Personal Information 
                      (for compensation or otherwise) in order to allow them to 
                      introduce their products and/or promotional efforts to you. 
                      Other than discussed herein, we will not knowingly sell, 
                      rent or trade any of your Personal Information. </p>
                    <p>YaYa may also collect demographic information from users 
                      such as age, gender and areas of interest. We plan to use 
                      this information to improve our site and affiliated game 
                      sites by measuring interest, traffic and usage patterns. 
                      We may share this information with third parties, in a non-personal, 
                      aggregate form only. Advertisers pay us to place advertisements 
                      on our site and affiliated game sites and in our games, 
                      but they want to make sure that the relevant content reaches 
                      the target audience. For example, we might tell an advertiser 
                      the number of users in a certain age range that responded 
                      to an ad. This information will not identify you personally, 
                      and other than discussed herein, we will not knowingly provide 
                      any Personal Information to any third party. </p>
                    <p> <b>Your Responsibility: </b></p>
                    <p>Although we will protect your privacy on our site and affiliated 
                      game sites as described in this Policy, you should keep 
                      in mind that if you voluntarily disclose Personal Information 
                      online, that information may be accessible to others. This 
                      is also true if anyone else has access to your personal 
                      computer, such as an employer or family member. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, some of our business partners, clients, and/or 
                      affiliates have web sites through which you may "opt 
                      in," by registration or otherwise, to receive information 
                      from us and/or link to our site and affiliated game sites. 
                      We make reasonable efforts to ensure, but cannot guarantee, 
                      that any Personal Information we receive from you through 
                      such an "opt-in" is covered by this Policy and 
                      protected as though such Personal Information was registered 
                      by you directly with us. </p>
                    <p>However, if you link to a third party site from our site 
                      or affiliated game sites, any information you reveal on 
                      that site is not subject to this Policy. You should consult 
                      the privacy policies of each site you visit. </p>
                    <p><b>Referrals: </b></p>
                    <p>If you elect to use our referral service to inform a friend, 
                      we’ll ask you to provide the friend’s name and 
                      e-mail address. YaYa will automatically send your friend 
                      an e-mail inviting them to visit our site. YaYa stores this 
                      information for the purpose of sending this invitation e-mail. 
                      The friend may contact us to request the removal of this 
                      information from our database at any time by e-mailing changes@yaya.com. 
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Children: </b></p>
                    <p>Protecting children online is of the utmost importance 
                      to YaYa. We currently define children as minors under the 
                      age of 13 years old. </p>
                    <p>While it is not necessary to register to use most of our 
                      games, if for any reason someone under the age of 13 attempts 
                      to register with us, we ask that he or she have a parent 
                      or guardian present to consent to the registration. Such 
                      consent is given by, and deemed by us to be given by, the 
                      parent registering with our site concurrently with or immediately 
                      subsequent to the child's registration. Much of the same 
                      Personal Information that would be collected from an adult 
                      is collected from a child during the registration process, 
                      if parental consent is contained. However, under the Children's 
                      Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site operator can 
                      require, as a condition of participation in an activity, 
                      that a child under the age of 13 disclose more information 
                      than is reasonably necessary. YaYa abides by this requirement. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We will not rent or sell children's Personal Information 
                      to any third party or client, or contact any children about 
                      special offers, if parental consent is not received at the 
                      time of the child's registration. Children and/or parents 
                      can update or delete information in the child's account 
                      by e-mailing us at changes@yaya.com and submitting the appropriate 
                      changes. </p>
                    <p>In addition, if a parent chooses not to allow us to further 
                      collect or use the child's Personal Information, that parent 
                      can contact us to request the removal of the child's Personal 
                      Information from our database at any time by e-mailing us 
                      at changes@yaya.com. Please note that Personal Information 
                      about a child may remain in back-up storage for some period 
                      of time after a request for deletion of that child's account. 
                      This may be the case even though no information about that 
                      account remains in our active user databases. </p>
                    <p><b>Use of Cookies: </b></p>

                      of our site and affiliated game sites will not function 
                      properly when you view them, and you may have to enter Personal

                    <p><b>Promotions and Prizes: </b></p>
                    <p>When you register for promotions or claim prizes on our 
                      site or affiliated game sites, we may collect Personal Information 
                      and general demographic data, such as, year of birth, gender, 
                      zip code and country. Whenever we collect Personal Information, 
                      we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Statement 
                      on that page. </p>
                    <p>Some of our games reward successful players with prizes 
                      that can take the form of cash or other prizes. Only certain 
                      residents of the United States and Canada (excluding Quebec) 
                      who are 18 years of age or more are eligible to receive 
                      prizes, and all prize programs are void where prohibited 
                      by law. See the “Prize Rules” for complete details. 
                      In order to award cash and other prizes, we must collect 
                      more specific Personal Information for income tax purposes. 
                      This specific Personal Information includes: full legal 
                      name, complete address (city, state, country and zip/postal 
                      code), a social security number (social insurance number 
                      in Canada) and date of birth. If this information is not 
                      collected and verified, the prize will not be awarded. </p>
                    <p>If you win a prize, YaYa reserves the right to use your 
                      name, city and state and other information (excluding your 
                      social security number) in advertising, promotional and/or 
                      marketing materials as described in the Liability and Publicity 
                      Release on our Web-based prize claim form. </p>
                    <p>Participation in games with a prize component is strictly 
                      voluntary and is not a required part of our service. We 
                      only request Personal Information on any relevant prize 
                      claim forms if you have voluntarily chosen to play our prize-based 
                      games. You may play prize-based games at any time, but in 
                      order to collect any prize associated with those games, 
                      you must provide the information requested. Alternatively, 
                      you may elect not to play those games or may decline any 
                      prizes awarded in those games. </p>
                    <p><b>Member Surveys: </b></p>
                    <p>We occasionally run marketing surveys on our site and affiliated 
                      game sites. These surveys are used to fully understand our 
                      audience, to provide better service, as a factor in determining 
                      new features and games to add to our service, and to collect 
                      more specific aggregate demographic information. Participation 
                      in these surveys is always optional and voluntary. </p>
                    <p>Data collected from these member surveys is used by our 
                      marketing department and occasionally shared in aggregate 
                      form with our advertisers and sponsors. We may also use 
                      survey data to direct advertising that is more likely to 
                      be of interest to you. Your Personal Information is not 
                      disclosed to a third party as part of our member surveys 
                      without your consent. </p>

                      affiliated game sites are stored in a physically secure,

                      behind a barrier known as a “firewall.” The firewall 
                      is designed to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing 
                      our servers. We also maintain internal controls in order

                      you provide to us. </p>
