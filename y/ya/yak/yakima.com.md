# Privacy Policy

## What Information do we collect about you?

### Information provided directly

Yakima asks for and receives information directly from you. We ask this information to perform actions such as processing purchases, showing you relevant information related to your car and previously owned Yakima products, and providing technical support. Instances of directly collected information can be found below:

  * Registering with Yakima.com
  * Signing up for our email newsletter

  * Applying for Yakima Pro



When you interact with us directly, we may collect the following information from you: your name, address, email address, phone number, occupation, proof of occupation, industry, transaction information from previous orders, credit card information, and automotive information.

### Information about your use of Yakima.com

In addition to the information you provide, we may collect information about your use of Yakima.com through software on your device and other means. However, none of this information is directly attributed to you - unique IDs are used to hide this information from us and any third party, thus we are unable to attribute any of this data to you as a user of Yakima.com. For example, we may collect:

  * The IP address of the device you are using
  * Pages you view
  * Links and advertisements you click



## How we use your information

All information shared both directly and indirectly collected will be kept confidential. It is collected and processed for the following purposes or for other lawful business processes:

  * To process payment
  * To improve our products and services
  * To contact you directly
  * To train our internal team
  * To customize our communication for you
  * To allow our business partners (social media channels, etc) to present customized messages for you.



### Direct Marketing

We may use information about you to provide you with information about products or services, promotions, special offers and other information which relates to our products or services or which we believe may be of interest to you.

Where your consent is required, we will usually ask for it by asking to you tick an "opt-in" box on the pages of our website where we ask for information about you. The "opt-in" box may or may not be split between different classes of information or different means of marketing.

We may send you such information by:

  * email
  * post
  * smartphone applications
  * social networking websites
  * phone
  * or any other method which becomes relevant from time to time.



You can change your mind about your preferences (as defined above) in respect of direct marketing by contacting our Customer Service Team at 888-925-4621, [support@yakima.com](mailto:support@yakima.com), or at 4101 Kruse Way, Lake Oswego, OR 97035. You can do this at any time. In addition, if you receive direct marketing from us by email, you will be reminded in the email that you are free to request a change to your preferences. If you do change your mind about your preferences, we would not remove your Personal Data from our data base(s) but we would note your changed preferences and would cease using your information for the purpose of direct marketing as soon as reasonably possible. If you want your email address deleted permanently, please contact us directly.

## To whom do we disclose your information?

Yakima may share your personal data with third parties. However, we only would share your personal data for the reasons stated above on how we use your information, or to comply with the law or respond to compulsory legal process (such as a search warrant or other court order) or to verify or enforce compliance with Yakima's policies.

## What do we do to keep your information secure?

Yakima strives to keep all data and information collected on our site secure. We use proven secure payment tools and methods like HTTPS across Yakima.com. However, please keep in mind that although we take reasonable steps to protect your information, no website is completely secure. Our Services may link to third-party websites and services that are outside our control.
