## INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE 

Yahoo7 does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you have requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We provide the information, in compliance with the Australian Privacy Principles, to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Yahoo7 under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Yahoo7 communicate with you about offers from Yahoo7 and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information, except to the extent required by law.
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Yahoo7’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if Yahoo7 is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Yahoo7 will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



Yahoo7 displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.

  * Yahoo7 does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
  * Yahoo7 advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).



Yahoo7 works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business.
