In order to respond to an individual’s inquiry or request, the individual user agrees and understands that it may be necessary for Yanmar to share their Private Information with other Yanmar group companies.

We collect personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, first and last name, position, employer details, home or work address or telephone number and other information. We also collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.

This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by us for the operation of our services, to maintain quality of the services, and to provide general statistics regarding use of our websites.

If you use our services, such as interactive services, we may collect information about you or other individuals included in your posts, materials, messages or other contributions (as defined in our **Terms of Use** ) which you may share with other Users or the public. We ask that you respect the data privacy rights of any individuals who are referred to, or whose personally identifiable information is included in, your contributions.

Most of the above mentioned information will constitute  **“Personally Identifiable Information’  **or  **“Personal Data”** , depending on the extent to which such information is protected by privacy or data protection laws in the relevant country.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose Personally Identifiable Information through our public discussion or message boards, this information may be collected and used by others.

In these circumstances we will, as may be required by applicable law, ensure that your privacy rights are adequately protected by appropriate technical, organization, contractual or other lawful means.

We may keep an anonymized form of your Personally Identifiable Information, which will no longer refer to you, for statistical purposes without time limits, to the extent that we have a legitimate and lawful interest in doing so.

### Security of your Personally Identifiable Information

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with industry standards to safeguard your Personally Identifiable Information. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the _______________________ protocol. However, no security measure is completely secure (e.g. from malicious intrusion) and we are unable to guarantee complete security of your Personally Identifiable Information.

In order to improve the security of your Personally Identifiable Information and your User account, we would advise that you must choose a strong password to protect your account information and to change it regularly at reasonable intervals. Furthermore, you must exit from your User account at the end of each session, not allow your browser to save your login details and secure and limit access to your personal devices.

### Monitoring

We may monitor your use of our websites and services, including our interactive and communications services by intercepting, blocking, recording or otherwise accessing systems whether on a continuous or occasional basis, as permitted by applicable law. For example, where allowed by applicable law we may monitor the content of any messages sent to your User account by another User or external party and how your devices access our websites and services.

We monitor in order to ensure compliance with our legal obligations and good practice, your compliance with our Terms and policies, to gather information as part of investigations by regulatory bodies or in connection with legal proceedings or requests, to ensure confidentiality of commercially sensitive information, to operate firewalls, prevent viruses, malicious code and the downloading or use of executable software code, to prevent the downloading, copying, distribution or other use of obscene, offensive or illegal material (such as pornographic, racist or other discriminatory content), to restrict access to third-party websites, blogs and bulletin boards in accordance with applicable systems use policies, and to prevent unauthorized access and modifications to our systems.
