To provide you with access to the Sites and Services, your Personal information is collected and used by YANDEX LLC, a company incorporated under the Russian law, with a head office registered at 16 Lva Tolstogo St., Moscow 119021, Russia (“YANDEX” LLC), or its affiliates for particular Services. You can find information about the entity, which provides particular Service, in the terms of use.

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland Yandex is represented by its Finnish entity, Yandex Oy, a company incorporated under the Finnish law, with an office registered at Moreenikatu 6, 04600 Mantsala, Finland.

Privacy and security of your Personal information are extremely important to us. When you use the Sites and/or Services, Yandex processes your Personal information and ensures its protection in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

As part of our commitment to protecting your Personal information, we use this Policy to transparently inform you about the following:

(a) why and how your Personal information is used (also, “processed”) by Yandex when you access the Sites or Services;

(b) Yandex’s role and responsibilities in this context as the legal entity deciding why and how your Personal information is processed;

(c) what instruments you may use to limit the amount of Personal information collected by Yandex; and

(d) what your rights are in relation to the above processing.

Personal information collected when you use the Sites and/or Services may differ depending on whether you access the Sites or Services while logged in to your Yandex user account or without logging in. When you are logged in to your Yandex user account as you are using the Sites or Services, Personal information collected by Yandex may be collated and combined with other Personal information (such as your identity, contact details, age and gender, if you shared this information with us) collected by Yandex in your user account. Yandex does not verify Personal information provided by you and cannot posit if it is true and whether you have the legal capacity required. However, Yandex assumes that the information you provide is true, sufficiently complete and up-to-date.

Personal information collected by Yandex when you access, interact with or operate the Sites and/or Services includes:

(i) information provided by you when you register (create) a user account, such as your name, mobile phone number, address and age;

(ii) electronic data (http headers, IP address, cookies, web beacons/pixel tags, browser information, information about your hardware and software);

(iii) date and time of accessing the Sites or Services;

(iv) information related to your activity when using the Sites or Services (e.g. your search history, email addresses of your contacts, content of your emails together with attachments, as well as files stored in Yandex systems);

(v) (geo)location information;

(vi) other information about you that needs to be processed according to the terms and conditions of any specific Yandex Site or Service; and

(vii) information about you that we may receive from our Partner in accordance with an agreement you made with this Partner and an agreement between Yandex and this Partner.

In addition, Yandex uses cookies and web beacons (including pixel tags) to collect your Personal information and associate this Personal information with your device and web browser (see Section 11 below).

We do not actively collect any sensitive personal data (such as racial origins, political opinions, health or biometric data). However, you may voluntarily provide us which such data and we may process it as part of providing you with our Services (e.g. if you perform search queries related to your health). As we do not know in advance the potentially sensitive nature of the personal data you may provide to us, you must be aware that we may not be able to request your consent with such processing.

We do not perform any form of profiling which has the potential to significantly impact your rights and freedoms.

Yandex is not allowed to process your Personal information if it does not have a valid legal ground. Yandex will therefore only process your Personal information if:

(i) the processing is necessary to perform our contractual obligations towards you including providing you with Sites and/or Services (i.e. providing you with the results of your search query);

(ii) the processing is necessary to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations; or

(iii) in case it is provided by applicable law, the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of Yandex and does not unduly affect your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Please note that when we process your Personal information on this basis, we will always seek to maintain a balance between our legitimate interest and the protection of your privacy.

Examples of such ‘legitimate interests’ referred in (iii) immediately above are:

(a) to better understand how you interact with our Sites and/or Services;

(b) to enhance, maintaining accessibility, modify, personalize or otherwise improve the Sites and Services for the benefit of all users; and

(c) to offer you other products and services from Yandex or other companies which we think can be of interest to you (i.e. personally-targeted advertising).

(iv) for specific purposes we may ask your consent for processing of your Personal information.

Yandex always processes your Personal information for a specific purpose and only processes Personal information which is relevant to achieve that purpose. In particular, we process your Personal information for the following purposes:

(i) to provide you with the Sites and/or Services (i.e. delivery of search results in response to your search queries, taking into account your preferences, search history and other Personal information about you available to Yandex);

(ii) to provide you with access to your user account, including your email and storage service, if you have an account on these Services;

(iii) to contact you to notify and/or inform you or request information from you in relation to the Sites and Services, or to execute our agreements with you or process your request or application;

(iv) to provide advertisements and/or commercial offers based on your preferences, search history and other Personal information available to Yandex;

(v) to improve user experience, including offering more relevant search results and more personalised Sites and/or Services, as well as improving other Yandex products, applications and services;

(vi) to develop new products, applications and services;

(vii) to protect your rights and the rights of Yandex; and

(viii) to collect, process and present statistical data or big data, or perform other research and/or analysis of Personal information.

In most cases, Personal information is processed automatically without access to it by our staff. However, if such access is necessary, your Personal information can be accessed only by those Yandex employees whose professional tasks require using this information. To protect your Personal information and ensure its confidentiality, these employees must comply with internal rules and follow protocols for processing Personal information. They are also required to follow all technical and organisational security measures protecting your Personal information.

Yandex has also implemented adequate technical and organisational measures to protect Personal information against unauthorised, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, misuse, disclosure or access and against all other unlawful forms of processing. These security measures have been implemented taking into account the state of the art of the technology, their cost of implementation, the risks presented by the processing and the nature of Personal information.
