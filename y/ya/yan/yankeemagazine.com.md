# Yankee Magazine - Privacy Policy

**For Web Visitors**

Yankee Publishing Inc. respects your right to privacy. 

We use the information you supply us in different ways. We use your survey responses and feed-back e-mail to help us improve the content and experience offered to our Web users. And we use your contact information to interact with you (if that was your intention). 

We will only save your contact information if you indicate that you would like to be updated on new offerings about our Web site. In this case we will add your name to the subscription list for our e-mail newsletter, which we send out periodically. You can remove your name from this list by following the instructions in the newsletter text. 

We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and for internal reporting. If you are visiting our store, we also use cookies to maintain your order in our shopping cart. 

For information you provide to us, we will not rent or share your contact information outside of Yankee Publishing Inc. without your permission -- with two exceptions: when you enter a sweepstakes on our Web site we offer it to the establishment(s) that provides the sweepstakes prize; and if you subscribe to _Yankee_ Magazine the information you provide follows the guidelines listed below in "Print Subscribers Privacy Policy." 

Yankee Publishing Inc. is comprised of different operating groups. Any information we save about you will be shared among these operating groups. Occasionally you may receive offers from these operating groups, to remove your name from those lists, follow the instructions within the communication. 

**Print Subscribers Privacy Policy**

We occasionally make our subscriber mailing list available to mailers whose offers we think may be of interest to our readers. If you would prefer not to receive such offers, please send a letter to the address below asking us not to release your name to third parties. Include your address label if possible. Please allow 12 weeks for your request to take effect.
