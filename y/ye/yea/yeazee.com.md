Please note that we have special concerns about the privacy of users who are minors (users under the age of 18), as further addressed in the regarding children section below. 

#### 1\. Information we gather

We do not collect any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") about you (such as your name, physical address, email address, or telephone number) without your permission when you use the Service. Many features of our Service do not require you to register for an account or provide any Personal Information to us. However, if you wish to submit an online request for quotations you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information, including your name, company, e-mail address, and telephone number. In order to take advantage of certain features of the Service (including, without limitation, the posting of reviews of businesses and the receipt of newsletters and special offers from Yeazee, you may be required to create an online account with Yeazee. During the Account creation process, you may be required to provide certain Personal Information, including without limitation, your name and e-mail address. We may also request other information such as your zip code, age range, gender, and whether you want to receive promotional information from Yeazee.com. We will store all of this information. We will always let you know whether such Personal Information is required or optional. In providing our Services to you, it may be necessary to share your Personal Information with our partners or allow such Partners to gather such Personal Information directly. Where our Partners gather Personal Information about you in the course of providing Services to you, we will make you aware of such fact and if you provide such Personal Information, those Partners may continue to use such Personal Information, subject to their respective privacy policies. You represent, warrant and covenant that any Personal Information that you supply to us will be is true, complete and accurate in all respects. Our Web Pages will transmit non-personally identifiable information ("Anonymous Information") that your browser makes available whenever you visit a web site or perform a search. Anonymous Information is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information and does not permit identification of you. Anonymous Information may include your Internet Protocol address, geographic location, browser type, browser language, mobile device type, operating system, operating system version, the domain name of the web site from which you linked to our Service, search queries entered by you on our Service, and the date and time of your queries. Anonymous Information does not by itself identify you to us, though such Anonymous Information may be unique or consist of or contain information that you consider personal. Please note that any search query information collected by us is maintained by Yeazee on an aggregated basis (i.e., together with the queries of all of our end-users) for the purposes of generating statistics regarding the use of our Service (such as the number of queries performed by the average end-user per month, a list of the most popular query terms, etc.), and is never used in a manner that matches specific search query information with the identity of any particular end-user. If you access our Services from a mobile device or on our mobile application(s), we may collect your device’s unique identifier. We may look at how often you use our mobile application if you access our Services from such application and where you downloaded it. We may combine or associate your unique device identifier with other Personal Information or Anonymous Information that you have provided to us or that we have directly or indirectly collected. 

#### 2\. Cookies and web beacons

When you visit a Yeazee Search Page, a cookie that uniquely identifies your browser may be sent to your computer or mobile device. A "cookie" is a small file containing your preferences that is sent to your browser and sent back by your browser each time your browser accesses our servers. Cookies that we may use may only be read by the server that placed them there. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service (for example, by fulfilling your language, filtering, and other preferences) and to better understand how people interact with our Service (for example, by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search). Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some aspects of the Service may not function properly without cookies. We currently use web analytics to help us measure the effectiveness of our Service, including the advertising on the Service. To do this, we allow the web analytics company to include Web beacons and cookies on the Web Pages. The type of information collected via such Web beacons and cookies includes search terms, search parameters, click-throughs by users, and other similar information. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like user preferences, popular search categories, click-through rates, how to improve our Service, and what kinds of offers our users like to see.   


#### 3\. How we use the information we gather

Broadly speaking, we use Personal Information and Anonymous Information for purposes of administering our business activities and making available other products and services to our visitors and prospective visitors. Most of the Anonymous Information collected is used to operate, develop, and improve our products and services. For example, Yeazee may use your IP address to determine which language to use to provide you with Internet search results or to advise you how far a particular vendor is from your location. In addition, information collected from end-users may be used in aggregate form to, among other things, determine the total number of end-users who are using our Service, prepare utilization reports for our Partners, diagnose and fix compatibility problems or other problems with our Service, and perform statistical analyses to enable us to build higher quality, more useful online services. We may use Personal Information and Anonymous Information that you provide to us to process account transactions that you request or authorize, to make you aware of new or other services that we offer, or to help conduct surveys to assess and improve our Service. The information collected from end-users also allows us to deliver search results pages that are as responsive as possible to an individual end-user's particular search query of the content of the page such end-user is viewing (for example, serving results in the end-user's native language and tailored to the end-user's country of connectivity). We may use the Anonymous Information collected from you to show advertising and promotions tailored to your interests. If you submit a request for information about Yeazee through our web site, we may use your e-mail address to send you an e -mail that gives you the opportunity to elect to receive periodic e-mail alerts from Yeazee.com regarding developments at the company. In addition, if you elect to receive promotional information from Yeazee.com when you create a Yeazee.com Account, we will use the information you provided during the Account creation process to send you only promotions that will be most relevant to you. We do not collect or provide e-mail alerts, promotions or advertising based on your Personal Information without your permission. 

#### 4\. When we disclose the information we gather

As a general rule, we do not share the Personal Information we collect from end-users with third-parties. unless it is necessary to do so to fulfil the user request for quotations from trusted partners. We may disclose Personal Information if it is required by law, necessary to defend our legal rights or enforce our policies, or if we in good faith believe it is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity in which you may be involved (or are reasonably suspected to be involved), even without a subpoena, warrant or court order. Such Personal Information will be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We reserve the right to share Anonymous Information with others. Examples of this include the number of users who searched for "used cars" or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. In addition, if in the future we sell or transfer assets or portions of our business, or if we experience a change in control, reorganization or liquidation, we may transfer such information to our successor or buyer, subject to this Privacy Policy. Please note that if you access the Service or Yeazee Web Pages from a shared computer or a public computer, such as one in an internet café, certain information about you, such as your Yeazee Account, may be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you. 

#### 5\. Accessing, reviewing and changing your personal information

If you have a Yeazee Account with us, you have the ability to review and update your Personal Information online by clicking on a "My Account" link (or similar link) on the Service and logging into your Yeazee Account. You can also review and update your Personal Information by contacting us at privacy@yeazee.com . Generally, we will not modify your Personal Information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your Personal Information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your Yeazee Account and remove your Personal Information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your Account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain Personal Information from closed Yeazee Accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our terms and conditions, and take other actions permitted by law.

#### 6\. Public forums; User reviews

We may make chat rooms, message boards, news groups, and other community services available to you through the Service. If you have a Yeazee Account, you can post reviews of businesses to the Service, which we then store, and participate in the community services. Postings and activities in the community services are governed by our Terms of Service. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, and the postings may appear on other third-party websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose Personal Information in a review, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address in a review, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your review or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily provide using the community services, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your Personal Information. We may sell your reviews to third-parties. The information presented in the community service areas reflects the views of the individual users or hosts and does not necessarily reflect our views.

Such web sites may send their own cookies to end-users, collect data, or solicit Personal Information from you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites, including such web sites' use of any information collected when our end-users click through to such web sites. If you are concerned about the privacy policy of a certain third party, we strongly encourage you to contact them directly or visit their individual web sites to learn more about their individual privacy policies.
