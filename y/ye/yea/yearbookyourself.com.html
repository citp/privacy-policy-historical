              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
              <h2>What type of information do we collect?</h2>

              <h2>How do we collect the information?</h2>
              <p>The Website may use cookies to collect information about your computer in order to facilitate your use of the Website. &nbsp;For example, when you visit the Website, cookies allow us to recognize you, and then when you return to our website, they allow us to direct you to your Homeroom page on the Website. &nbsp;Cookies do not allow us to personally identify you, but help us improve the quality of your visit to the Website.&nbsp; We also collect information that you provide to us when sign up for an email alert, such information might consist of your name, if you provide it, e-mail address and computer identification.  </p>

              <h2>How do we use the information you provide us?</h2>
              <p>We will use the information that you provide us only to facilitate your use of the Website and email alert.&nbsp; We will only save your information for a one-time email alert (other than cookies), and we will not transfer or sell information about you to any third parties except to a business partner which operates the Website.&nbsp; If we should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company while we still have any personally identifiable information collected through this Website, or if we should decide to buy, sell or reorganize some part or all of our business, we may be required to disclose your personal information to prospective or actual purchasers or receive personal information from sellers.&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
Although we will protect your privacy on the Website as described in this Policy, you should keep in mind that if you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information may be accessible to others. This is also true if anyone else has access to your personal computer, such as an employer or family member. However, if you link to a third party website from the Website, any information you reveal on that website is not subject to this Policy. You should consult the privacy policies of each website you visit.<br>
<br>
We may be required to disclose your personal information such as your name, if you provide it, e-mail address and computer identification if we believe it is necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.), or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit; is otherwise necessary to protect our rights or property; or is necessary to protect the interests of other users of the Website.&nbsp; </p>

              <h2>How do we protect kids' privacy?</h2>
              <p>We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from any person under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.&nbsp; We also do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13, or knowingly allow such persons to register.&nbsp; If you are under 13, you should not attempt to register for the Website or send information about yourself to us.&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
If we become aware that a user of the Website is under the age of 13 and is without verifiable parental consent, we will remove any personally identifiable information about that person from our files.</p>
              <h2>What about links to other websites and services?</h2>
              <p>The Website may contain links to other websites that we do not control; those websites have their own policies and procedures regarding privacy. We recommend that you review those policies before entering those websites, as we have no responsibility for any linked websites. We simply provide those links for your convenience.</p>
              <h2><strong>International visitors consent to this Policy too</strong></h2>
              <p>Privacy laws differ across the globe.&nbsp; If it is necessary for the purposes for which you have shared personal information with us for us to share your information within our global operations, we will do so consistent with this Policy.</p>
