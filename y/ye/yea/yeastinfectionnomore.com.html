      IMPORTANT -- PLEASE READ</strong> </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">This Privacy Policy describes the 
      terms of our commitment to your privacy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>PERSONS OR PARTIES

      paid or unpaid, all members or affiliates whether paid or unpaid, and all 
      customers. Persons who visit or view this website, whether intentionally 
      or unintentionally, whether solicited or unsolicited, are described herein 
      as "Visitors" and are parties to this Privacy Policy. Subscribers to lists 
      or Newsletters are referred to herein as "Subscribers" and are parties to 
      the Privacy Policy. Persons who join an organization or marketing endeavor 
      (e.g. "affiliates") promoted by this website are called "Members" herein 
      and are covered by this Privacy Policy. Finally, anyone who orders, 
      attempts to order, or receives a product sold (recipients) or advertised 
      on or delivered from this website, even at no cost, is called a "Customer" 
      herein and is subject to this Privacy Policy not only by passive 
      acceptance, but by virtue of the Purchase Agreement contract. The website, 
      its agents, owners, operators, and employees are referred to collectively 
      herein as "Website," "Site," and/or "Seller". </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>PERSONS EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE ARE 
      STILL COVERED</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the event that a person excluded from this 
      website because of the Terms of Use or from denial of service by the 
      website, who nonetheless unlawfully views this site, that person remains 
      subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and is in violation of the 
      Terms of Use. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong><u>PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE ARE 
      EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE</u></strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>This website is not lawfully accessible to 
      persons under the age of 18 or who are otherwise covered by the provisions 
      of the Child Online Privacy Act of 1998 (COPA). If you are under the age

      may make you subject to civil or criminal sanctions.</u> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION 
      IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY</strong> 
</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy 
      is a portion of the consideration required for your right to visit the 
      website. If you do not accept these terms, you have no right to visit this 
      site and you are fraudulently using this site. </font></p>
      


      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR 
      CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Registration means that the Visitor, 
      Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate 
      information to this website. This can include pages or 'pop ups' where you 
      register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include 
      your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting 
      information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from 
      joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or 
      unpaid; it may be from ordering a product. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Occasionally complete credit card information 
      may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than 
      regular secure merchant service processing. This information is kept at 
      the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the 
      merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the 
      customer. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>ONLINE ORDERING</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication 
      provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies 
      like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but does not 
      provide complete credit card numbers. In the process of online ordering, 
      the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone 
      number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password. 
      You should consider all this information available to the website. This 
      information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase 
      Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes. 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</strong> 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Website visitors who wish to communicate with 
      the website do so under two conditions: one, they give their permission 
      for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any 'submission' 
      provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy 
      Policy. While your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it 
      is added to the website's general solicitation database. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR 
      TESTIMONIALS</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;If you are a customer and send an email 
      to the website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the 
      website collects information about your communication and by communicating 
      with the site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and 
      otherwise use any information collected as the site sees fit. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Any communication which, in its sole 
      discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for 
      commercial purposes. </font></p>
      
      
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;<strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 
      ELECTRONIC MEANS AND 'COOKIES'</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many websites, including this one, collect 
      information about your computer, your email address, your IP address. You 
      must assume that your web-viewing or web-use activity is monitored, 
      tracked, and information collected. This information is not usually of a 
      personal nature, but it may help define your viewing habits and product 
      preferences even though the website may or may not have any idea who you 
      are. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Cookies" is web jargon for bits of computer 
      code placed on your hard drive. Websites use this to keep you 'logged in', 
      to keep track of search criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use 
      of the site or use of products sold by the site. Cookies can also be used 
      to obtain information about your computer configuration or your use of 
      your computer. </font></p>
     
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT 
</strong> 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.<br><br>

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.<br><br>

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on www.yeastinfectionnomore.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by www.yeastinfectionnomore.com or Higher Ways Publishing Inc. and other topics we think you might find of interest.<br><br>

Personally Identifiable Information collected by www.yeastinfectionnomore.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
