This Online Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to those websites that display or link to this Policy. This Policy applies to data collected by us through our Website and services that display these terms. It does not apply to those sites, services and products that do not display or link to this Policy or that have their own privacy policies. This Policy describes the information we collect and how we use it. By visiting our Website, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Website.

**Consent to Collection and Processing**

This Website may be operated, in whole or in part, from a country other than the United States. By using our Website, you consent to having your personal information transferred to and processed in a jurisdiction outside of the United States.

**What Information about me does yeezysupply.com collect and store?**

Our privacy policy is simple: Except as disclosed below, we don't sell, trade, give away, or rent your personal information to any company, other than our partner, adidas, which operates this Website. One of the basic principles we've tried to follow in designing this Website is to limit the information we collect from and share about you. 

**Personal Information**

We collect and store information that you provide to our Website or our Customer Service Department or that we receive from third parties (such as companies providing commercially available databases). For example, when you place an order, we collect and store some or all of the following information that you provide: name, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, and credit card number and expiration date. We collect your e-mail addresses and zip code if you subscribe to our newsletter and we collect your mobile number if you opt in to receive text messages. You may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions located within each newsletter or linked to each text message. We also collect and store your geolocation information. Registration may be required and personal information collected in certain areas of the Website in which you specifically and knowingly provide such information, e.g. community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or customer service requests. When we run a contest or sweepstakes relating to our Website, it will be accompanied by a set of rules. The rules for each contest/sweepstakes will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed, if it is different than as described in this Policy. Personal information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to our sponsors or us.

**Usage Information**

Through your use of our Website, we may also gather certain information about your use of our Website ("Usage Information"). Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data".

You may occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf to tailor advertisements shown to you for goods and services. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Website. Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals, but several of our service providers who utilize these cookies and other tracking technologies on our Website enable you to opt out of this type of advertising.
