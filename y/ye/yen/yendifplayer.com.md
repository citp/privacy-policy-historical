# Yendif Player - Privacy Policy

yendifplayer.com is committed to protecting you and your personal information when you are using our services. We want our services to safe and enjoyable environments for our users. This Privacy Policy is relevant to our use of any personal information you provide to us during your visit to our site.

yendifplayer.com seeks to follow the industry's best practices concerning personal information handling.

Whenever you register for our members-only services, for example using our forum, we may ask personal information about you. This can consist of such information as your name, e-mail, website address, gender, etc. By entering the information in the fields requested you enable yendifplayer.com to provide you with the services you select.

yendifplayer.com will NOT sell, rent or otherwise willingly transmit the recorded personal information to any third party. Your privacy is important to us and we will not even offer aggregate information resulting from personal information processing to any part outside yendifplayer.com. We only use the recorded personal information for:

  * service administration purposes, e.g. sending you password reminders, registration confirmations, billing subscription services etc.;
  * to contact you regarding new content added on our website, e.g. new forum posts, if you have opted in for this sort of communication;
  * to personalize your experience, through the storage of your preferences in our site's database;
  * analyze the use of our website and improve its usability;
  * dispute chargeback requests
