Effective Date: June 1, 2018

**Introduction**

The Community Company ( **“Company”** or **“We”** ) respects your privacy and we want to ensure you are aware of what data we intend to keep and how we will handle the data you provide to us.  .

This privacy policy describes the types of information We may collect from individuals (collectively, “ **Users** ” or “ **you** ”) who visit the websites and related mobile sites related to Young Entrepreneur Council (collectively, our “ **Sites** “), including, but not limited to, https://yec.co.  Users of our Company-operated membership communities or networks (each a “ **Community** ” and collectively, the “ **Communities** ”),  whether or not such Users are members of a Community (the “ **Community Members** ”) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. If you have any questions about this policy, please submit an inquiry to concierge@yec.co (the “ **Community Contact** ”) with the subject line “Privacy Policy”. 

This policy applies to information We collect from Users:

  * on the Sites;
  * via email, text, telephonic and other electronic communications between you and Company;
  * through mobile and desktop applications you download from the Sites, which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and the Sites; and
  * when you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to the Sites.



It does not apply to information collected by:

  * us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by Company or any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries); or 
  * any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries), including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Sites.



Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how We will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not use our Sites. If you choose not to use our Sites then you will be prevented from exercising your Community membership. By accessing or using the Sites, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to Our Privacy Policy). Your continued use of the Sites after We make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates. 

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

It is our policy to post any changes We make to this privacy policy on this page. If We make material changes to how We treat our Users’ personal information, We will notify you through a notice on the Sites’ home page that this privacy policy has been changed. The date this privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring We have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Sites and this privacy policy to check for any changes.  For the avoidance of doubt, if your membership with the Company becomes inactive and you discontinue use of the Sites, the privacy policy current at that time will apply to the treatment of your data.
