				<tr><td align="left"><p>Your privacy is important to us. Yellowbrowser .com respects and takes steps to   protect the privacy of our customers. We strive to take reasonable care of   information we may receive from you.</p>
				    <h4>The Scope of This Privacy Policy</h4>
				    <p>This Privacy Policy addresses the privacy of visitors to the Yellowbrowser .com   Web sites. It identifies the type of data and information Yellowbrowser .com   collects from visitors, how we use and disclose it, and the steps we take to   protect privacy.</p>
				    <h4>What Information We Collect and How We Use It</h4>
				    <h5>Information We Collect</h5>
				    <p>Yellowbrowser .com collects personal information when you register with   Yellowbrowser .com, when you use Yellowbrowser .com products and services, when you   visit Yellowbrowser .com pages or the pages of certain Yellowbrowser .com partners,   and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes.</p>

We use this information to improve the   performance and operation of our site.</p>
				    <p>When you register, we ask for information such as your name, e-mail address,   birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For   the purchase of Yellowbrowser .com Advertising Products we may also ask for your   address, Social Security number, and credit card information. Once you register   with Yellowbrowser .com and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us   and we protect your personal information (see Security below).</p>
				    <p>Yellowbrowser .com collects information about your transactions with us and with   some of our business partners, including information about your use of products   and services that we offer.</p>
				    <p>Yellowbrowser .com automatically receives and records information on our server   logs from your browser, including your IP address, Yellowbrowser .com cookie   information, and the page you request.</p>
				    <p>Yellowbrowser .com uses information for the following general purposes: to   customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for   products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and   provide statistical reporting for internal and external clients.</p>
				    <h5>Your Ability to Edit Your Account Information and Preferences</h5>
				    <p>You can edit your Yellowbrowser .com Account Information, including your   marketing preferences, at any time. New categories of marketing communications   may be added to the Marketing Preferences page from time to time.

We reserve the right to send you certain   communications relating to the Yellowbrowser .com service, such as service   announcements and administrative messages that are considered part of your   Yellowbrowser .com account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of   receiving them.</p>
				    <h5>Cookies and Related Technologies</h5>
				    <p>A cookie is a small file that is stored on the hard drive of your computer,   ready for future access when you return to our site. We may use cookies to   tailor and improve the content we deliver to you while you are on our site. The   cookies do not contain or capture any personal information. You can configure   your computer's browser to alert you when a site is attempting to send you a   cookie, and then you can accept or refuse the cookie. Your decision to refuse   cookies from Yellowbrowser .com will not prevent you from using our site, but may   limit your ability to take advantage of some of our advanced features.</p>
				    <p>On some of the pages on our site we may also use small bits of computer code   called "one-pixel gifs," "clear gifs," or "Web beacons" embedded in Web pages to   monitor the activity on our Web site. Again, the technology does not capture or   contain any personal information.</p>
				    <h5>Children</h5>

				    <h5>Third Party Advertisers and External Links</h5>
				    <p>Some Yellowbrowser .com Web sites may accept advertisements from third-party   advertisers or provide links to external Web sites. Please check the privacy   policy of these advertisers and sites for information regarding their collection   of information and use of cookies. We are not responsible for the content or   privacy practices of other Web sites. Our partners or advertisers may use third   parties to serve or present the ads that appear on our site. These third parties   may place cookies on your browser when you visit our site. Any third party   cookies are subject to the privacy policy of the company placing them.</p>
				    <h5>Information We Disclose To Third Parties</h5>
				    <p>We may use aggregated information concerning how visitors use our Web site   and share such information with third parties in order to improve our Web site   and to help us attract advertisers and listings.

				    <ul>
                      <li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or   exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;   
                      </li><li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate,   prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,   situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,   violations of Yellowbrowser .com's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law;   
                      </li><li>We transfer information about you if Yellowbrowser .com is acquired by or   merged with another company. In this event, Yellowbrowser .com will notify you   before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different   privacy policy. </li>
			      </ul>
				    <p>Yellowbrowser .com does not provide any personal information to the advertiser   when you interact with or view an ad.</p>
				    <h5>Security</h5>
				    <p>Yellowbrowser .com takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to   protect your information. No data transmissions over the Internet can be   guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the   security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.   Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security   on our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such   information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of   any firewalls or secure server software we may employ. Yellowbrowser .com continues   to evaluate and implement enhancements in security technology and practices,   however we can only take steps to help reduce the risks of unauthorized access.   Yellowbrowser .com has taken the following steps in this regard:</p>
				    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <h5>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</h5>
                        <p>Yellowbrowser .com uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting   certain kinds of information, such as registration information or payment   information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most   browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other   forms of payment. Any time Yellowbrowser .com asks you for a credit card number on   Yellowbrowser .com for payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL   encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on our servers.   Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number on Yellowbrowser .com, it   will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it   in the future. Instead of the entire number, you will only see asterisks and   either the first four digits or the last four digits of your number.</p>
                      </li><li>
                        <h5>Secure Storage</h5>
                        <p>Yellowbrowser .com maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural   safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information   about you.</p>
                      </li><li>
                        <h5>Vendors and Partners</h5>
                        <p>Yellowbrowser .com works with vendors and partners to protect the security and   privacy of user information.</p>
                      </li><li>
                        <h5>Employee and Contractor Access to Information</h5>
                        <p>Yellowbrowser .com limits access to personal information about you to those   employees who we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that   information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their   jobs.</p>
                      </li><li>
                        <h5>Education and Training for Employees</h5>

			      </ul>
