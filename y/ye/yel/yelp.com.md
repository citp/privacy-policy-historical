# Yelp - Privacy Policy

## Yelp Privacy policy

Yelp is an online application that helps people find local services they can trust by asking their friends. To accomplish this, our users send requests via email to their friends, which in turn respond via the web site with reviews. For the purposes of this document, a friend is defined as someone you have sent a request to or explicitly invited to share reviews with you. To fulfill the purpose of our site, we need to display a limited amount of personal information, so that users are able to evaluate the trustworthiness of a particular review. 

By using Yelp you permit the collection and use of your personal information as outlined below in our Privacy Policy. You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy. 

### Information We Collect

Yelp collects user submitted account information such as name and email address to identify you and send you notifications related to the use of the service. Yelp also collects user submitted location information such as city, state or zip. Yelp also collects user submitted reviews, ratings, and reviews of local businesses and service providers. 

Some information collected is not explicitly submitted by the user; we log your browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp. This information helps us diagnose problems with our server, administer Yelp, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you. 

### How We Use Your Information

Information such as your full name or email address may be shown to friends or other users primarily in conjunction with reviews you have contributed. If a person is a friend they can also see your name or email address in their list of friends. 

Your full name and email address may also used when you send an email notification to a friend (such as in a request for a review, in an invitation, when sharing a review, or when forwarding a request). We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding our site, but you may choose not to receive email of this type by accessing the "Account Settings" tab of the web site and updating your notification settings. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when a friend asks for a review). 

Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp data are used in the general administration of our service. 

### Transfer of Information

We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law. 

We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Yelp, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, Yelp will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

### Links

Yelp may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that Yelp is not responsible for the privacy policies of other sites. 

### Use of Cookies

Like most websites, Yelp requires cookies to function properly. Cookies are small text files that reside on a user's computer and identify you as a unique user. We use cookies to refine our site and simplify the user experience. For example, the use of cookies allows registered users to enter our site without explicitly typing in their email address and password every time. 

### Controlling Your Personal Information

As a registered Yelp user, you can modify your personal information at any time by accessing the "Account Settings" section of the site. Registered users who wish to close their account should contact [admin@yelp.com](mailto:admin@yelp.com). 

### Security

Your Yelp account is password-protected. This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. We use industry standard measures to protect your information that is stored within our database. We limit the access to your information to those employees who need access to perform their job function such as our customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please [contact us](mailto:admin@yelp.com). 

### Emails and Opt-out

At this time, registered members cannot opt-out of email messages initiated by their friends (such as, requests for a review), however they may opt-out of receiving notifications initiated by Yelp (note: notification settings can be found under the "My Account" tab). Unregistered users that do not wish to receive emails may opt-out of receiving any communications by following the instructions contained in all emails.
