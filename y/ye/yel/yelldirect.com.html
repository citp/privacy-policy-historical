        <h2 class="sitemap"><a name="hwci"></a>1.  The information we collect about you and how we do it</h2>

<p>To provide you with our products and services, we may need information about you.</p>  
<p>If you use our websites, you are in control of what information we collect about you, but if you choose not to share your information, you may not be able to access or use some areas of our websites.
</p><br>
                <strong>1a  How we collect information about you</strong>
        <p>We will ask for information about you when you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>advertise with us;</li>
          <li>ask for a free line entry (a listing of your business details which we will include in our services for free); </li>
          <li>order directories or any of our other products and services; </li>
          <li>apply for credit with us;</li>
          <li>register on Yell.com;</li>
          <li>register to use Yell Direct; </li>
          <li>ask for Yell.com Mobile services (the part of Yell.com you can use from a mobile phone);</li>
          <li>use the 'send-to-a-friend' feature on Yell.com (this is where you can email information about a business or service on our site to a friend);</li>
          <li>set up, look at, or change your profile or account with us;</li>
          <li>ask for information from us;</li>
          <li>give us a testimonial or other feedback;</li>
          <li>enter competitions or special promotions; or</li>
          <li>fill in surveys.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>We may ask other organisations for information about you, for example, if we check your credit rating or credit score, before we provide credit to you to allow you to buy advertising.  We also buy business information from other organisations, so we may get information about you from those organisations.</p>
        <br>

        <strong>1b  What information we collect</strong>
        <p>The information we collect and hold about you may include your:</p>

		<ul>
          <li>name (first and last name);</li>
          <li>business name;</li>
          <li>job title;</li>
          <li>business address;</li>
          <li>phone and/or mobile phone numbers;</li>
          <li>email address;</li>
          <li>Yell account number (sometimes we call this your SAP number);</li>
          <li>bank account, debit card and/or credit card details;</li>
          <li>date of birth;</li>
          <li>credit history, credit rating or credit score;</li>
          <li>password details, answers to security questions (for example your mother's maiden name) or both; and </li>
          <li>any other information you may give us when you write to us or contact us in other ways.</li>

        </ul>
        <br>

        <strong>1c  Why we need your email address</strong>
        <p>When you register on our websites, we collect your email address.  We may use it for account administration (for example to email you your password, if you forget it) and for added security.  We may use your email address to send you a confirmation of any order you make, if you buy our products or services and to confirm any profile or account changes you make.  We might also use your email address to bring you news such as changes to the way you can use our websites or new services and special offers we think you might be interested in.  For more information on direct marketing and how to change your preferences, please read section 4 - <a href="#dmah">Direct marketing and how you can change your marketing preferences</a>.</p>
        <strong>1d  Using Cookies</strong>
        <p>Cookies are information files stored on your computer that help websites remember you. We and our business partners collect information about your use of our websites through cookies.  For more information on how we use cookies and how to opt out of using them, please read section 10 - <a href="#tuoc">the use of Cookies on our websites and how you can reject them</a>.</p>
        <strong>1e  Recording your calls</strong>
        <p>Like many other companies that take orders, we may record or monitor information or expressions of opinion from customers over the phone, and calls that you receive from us, or make to us. We do this for security and training purposes.</p>
        <br><br>
        <a name="hwwu"></a>
        <h2>2  How we will use information we collect about you</h2>
        <p>Whenever you give us your personal information, legally we have to use it in accordance with the terms of various privacy laws, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (we refer to these laws in this privacy policy as the 'privacy laws').</p>
        <strong>2a  When you use our websites</strong>
        <p>When you give us information while using our websites, we will use it for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, on the data entry forms, in any relevant terms or conditions and on pages or emails which link to the data entry forms.</p>
        <strong>2b  Your browsing activity on Yell.com</strong>
        <p>If you use Yell.com, we will store the location you searched for (such as the postcode or geographic area). This lets you search for other types of business without having to re-enter the location every time. We only keep this information while you are searching and we will not keep it after you have left Yell.com, unless you register and save your searches. We also collect information on your activity while you are logged into Yell.com, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>your IP address (this is a unique 12 digit number used by programs on the internet to recognise and communicate with your computer);</li>
          <li>the type of browser you use (a browser is the program you use to look at websites, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari);</li>
          <li>the times when you access the site and for how long; and</li>
          <li>your referring URL (the site you come from to reach our website).</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>This information does not allow us to identify you. We collect it from lots of visitors to our websites and analyse it. This lets us build up a picture of how people use our websites. This helps us improve the services we offer.</p><br>
        <p>We may also give anonymous statistics about users to other, reputable organisations, but the information we provide will not include details that would allow these organisations to identify you.</p>
        <strong>2c  Website customisation and advert targeting</strong>
        <p>We may use the information you give us about yourself when you register on our websites to build up a picture of your interests.  We may then use this information to try to make sure that when you visit our websites, you don't miss offers and information that might interest you. This is called advert targeting. </p>
        <strong>2d  Tracking how our websites are used</strong>
        <p>We may collect information about activity on our websites, or we may use other organisations to do this and to share the results with us.  We use this information to:

          <li>track pages and paths used by visitors to our site;</li>
          <li>target the banner adverts on our websites and on the websites of other organisations; and</li>
          <li>track the use of our internet banner adverts and other links from our marketing partners' websites to our websites.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h2>9  Why we link to other websites</h2>
		<p>Our websites contain hyperlinks to websites that are owned and operated by other organisations. These websites have their own privacy and cookie policies, and we urge you to read them.  They control how your personal information  is used when you give it to these other organisations or they collect it with cookies.  We do not approve any other websites and we are not responsible for any information, material, products or services that are on or accessible through those websites or for the privacy practices of websites run by other organisations. If you use these other websites you do it at your own risk.</p><br><br>

        <a name="tuoc"></a>
        <h2>10  Using cookies on our websites and how you can reject them</h2>
		<p>A cookie is a piece of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are.  Cookies can help to display the information on a website in a way that matches your  interests.  Most major websites use cookies.  Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you.  We use two types of cookie on our websites.</p><br>
		<p>The first type is a 'session-based' cookie. This means that it is only saved on your hard disk for the time you are using our website. On Yell Direct, this cookie helps the website to 'remember' that you are logged into the site.  If you log in and then don't do anything for 20 minutes you will get a message telling you that your session has timed out and that you need to log in again.  This is a security measure to help protect your information. Within Yell.com we use these cookies to store your locations during a search session. When you have registered on Yell.com, we use them to let you access your address book. </p><br>
		<p>The second type of cookie we use stays on your hard disk for upto five years. This 'persistent' cookie helps us understand the number of different people coming to the site, rather than the total number of times the site is used. Without the persistent cookie, if you visited the site once each week for three weeks we would count you as three separate users. On Yell.com, we use these cookies to manage the adverts we show to visitors and to make sure that each visitor doesn't see the same advert too often. We also use them for research surveys, to make sure you are not invited to fill in a questionnaire too often, or after you have already done so. </p><br>
		<p>We do not store any of your personal information in either type of cookie.  We do not link cookies to information you have given us during registration. We only use cookies to help us make the services we offer better for all our users.</p><br>
		<p>If you do not want a website to create a cookie on your computer, most web browsers provide the option to disable them.  However,  our website may not work properly if you reject our cookies.</p><br>
		<p>If you want to know more about how cookies work and how to manage or delete them, visit the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/wwwsf2.html#CLT-Q10" rel="nofollow">World Wide Web Consortium's website</a> or visit the <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" rel="nofollow">Interactive Advertising Bureau's website</a>.</p><br>
		<p><strong>Web beacons</strong></p>  
<p>A web beacon - sometimes called a clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) or pixel tag - is a line of code that we have installed on some of our pages to help us learn more about how our visitors make use of the content and services that we offer, and to count how often people visit different areas of the website.  A web beacon is invisible to you and doesn't affect the content you see.</p><br>
		<p>Web beacons help us provide a better service to you by allowing us to understand which areas of the site are more popular with visitors than others.  We do not use web beacons to collect any personal information about you, but they allow us to build up general information about how people use our site.  Certain pages on our websites may also contain web beacons put in place by our advertising agencies so that we can measure how useful our advertising on other websites is.  Web beacon files let our agency recognise a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn means we can learn which adverts bring users to our websites.  The web beacon only records a limited amount of information that includes the cookie number, the page ID and the time and date you accessed the page. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number or email address.</p><br>
