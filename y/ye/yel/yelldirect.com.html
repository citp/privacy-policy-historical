<p></p><h2>Our Privacy Policy </h2><p></p>
<strong></strong><p id="registration"><strong>Registration </strong><br>

If you are a customer for any of Yell's products and services you can register to use Yell Direct. Registration enables us to give you private access to details we might be holding for you, like your Yell account information. We only collect the minimum information required to identify you and to ensure that we provide you with appropriate information. Details we collect may include: </p>

<ul style="margin-left:20px">
<li style="margin:0">first name and last name;</li>
<li style="margin:0">company name;</li>
<li style="margin:0">company address;</li>
<li style="margin:0">telephone number;</li>
<li>e-mail address.</li></ul>

<a href="#">Back to top</a><br><br>
<strong> </strong><p id="orders"><strong>Orders </strong><br>

When you order an advertisement or Domain Name on Yell.com we need to know a little bit about you. This enables us to process and fulfil your order, or contact you in case of a query. Details we may collect include: </p>


<ul style="margin-left:20px">
<li style="margin:0">first name and last name;</li>
<li style="margin:0">company name;</li>
<li style="margin:0">position;</li>
<li style="margin:0">company address;</li>
<li style="margin:0">telephone number;</li>
<li>e-mail address.</li></ul>

<a href="#">Back to top</a><br><br>

<strong></strong><p id="why"><strong>Why do you need my e-mail address?</strong><br>
We use your e-mail address to give confirmation of activities that you undertake on your account and advertising on the Yell Direct website. As such when you register on Yell Direct you have to provide an e-mail address.</p>
<p>As part of registration you're given the option of opting in or out of receiving occasional e-mails about new products and services from Yell. You can change your e-mail preference for this at any time by logging into Yell Direct and changing the preference in the "Your profile" section.</p>
<a href="#">Back to top</a><br><br>

<strong></strong><p id="as an advertiser"><strong>As an advertiser, do you store information on me? </strong><br>
Yes, but we only store information that we need to operate effectively and it is stored securely in our main database </p>


<p>We take the security of your personal data extremely seriously. We have implemented technology and security policies designed to protect the personal data under our control. We also follow strict security procedures as required by the UK Data Protection Act 1998. These cover the storage and disclosure of any information you've provided, and the prevention of unauthorised access. </p>


<p>Any credit card details you pass on to us are encrypted using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL). SSL is an industry standard for data encryption and is one of the best ways to ensure internet messages are not intercepted. Older browsers can't use SSL, so you'll need Netscape Navigator 3, Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 or later versions of these browsers. Credit card information is encrypted before any transaction takes place. </p>

<strong></strong><p id="does yell"><strong>Does Yell Direct make use of cookies? </strong><br>

Yes. A cookie is a text-only piece of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. At Yell we use two types of cookie on Yell Direct.</p>


This first type is a "session-based" cookie. This means that it only sits on your hard disk for the time you are using the Yell Direct site. This cookie helps us manage the fact that you are logged into the site. If you log in and then don't do anything for 20 minutes you'll get a message telling you that your session has timed out and that you need to log in again. This is a good security measure and is how this cookie is used.<p></p>


<p>The second type of cookie we use stays on your hard disk for a longer period of time. This "persistent" cookie helps us understand the number of unique people coming to the site. Without the persistent cookie, if you visited the site once each week for three weeks we'd count you as three separate users.</p>


<p>We don't store any of your personal information in either type of cookie. We only use cookies to help us make the service we offer better for all our users.</p>


<p>If you want to know more about how cookies work then visit this section of the  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/wwwsf2.html#CLT-Q10">World Wide Web Consortium's own website</a> for more information.</p>

<p id="security"></p><h2>Security and Yell Direct</h2><p></p>


<strong></strong><p id="logging in"><strong>Logging in to your account on Yell Direct</strong><br>

When you register we will send a PIN code to the address we already hold in our system for your business. The first time you use your username and password to log in to the site you will be asked to type in this PIN code in order to activate your account on Yell Direct.</p>


<p>Supplying this PIN code through the post in a separate communication to you ensures an extra level of security.</p>

<a href="#">Back to top</a><br><br>

<strong></strong><p id="yell direct"><strong> Yell Direct's secure servers</strong><br>

When you log in to your account on Yell Direct you will be asked to click on pop-up boxes that inform you that you're entering a secure environment. Within this secure environment all your data is scrambled using encryption technology which means that only you are able to see the information inside your account. The little padlock symbol that appears in the bottom right-hand corner of your browser appears on every page.</p>


<p>Communication between our system and your PC uses the latest digital certificate technology, which ensures that you communicate with us—and only us—when you sign on to Yell Direct.<br><br>

<a href="#">Back to top</a><br><br>

<strong></strong></p><p id="lost pass"><strong>Lost password </strong><br>

If you are having any difficulties logging in or you have forgotten your password, please call our Customer Service team free on 0800 555 444 (Monday–Friday, 8.00 am–8.00 pm; Saturday, 9.00 am–5.00 pm). Alternatively, take a look at our <a href="/contactus/loginproblems.html">Problems logging in? info page</a>.</p>

<a href="#">Back to top</a><br><br>

<strong></strong><p id="liability"><strong>Liability </strong><br>

Yell Direct cannot be held liable for any misuse of passwords. If you wish to change your password for security reasons please contact our Customer Service team free on 0800 555 444 (Monday–Friday, 8.00 am–8.00 pm; Saturday, 9.00 am–5.00 pm) and a new secure password will be issued to you. We may ask you to confirm this in writing within seven days.</p>

<a href="#">Back to top</a><br><br>

<strong></strong><p id="acting"><strong>Acting on your transactions </strong><br>

We will carry out transactions on your account following instructions you give us—or which appear to be given by you—through our internet service, provided the correct passwords are quoted.</p>


<p>We reserve the right not to act on any instructions which would result in not keeping to these conditions or those applying to your account.</p>


<p>If we decide not to carry out a transaction, we will not be responsible for any loss or damage you suffer because of that decision. We will normally tell you why we are not prepared to carry out a transaction.</p>


<p>If we are unable to let you carry out a transaction using our internet service because of something beyond our reasonable control or the reasonable control of those acting on our behalf, we will not be responsible for any loss or damage you suffer as a result. An example of when this may happen is when a PC, browser or other equipment necessary to use our system is faulty or out of order.</p>


<p>We shall have no liability if you are unable to use our internet service because of the failure of any machine, data processing system or transmission link or anything else beyond our reasonable control. We have taken reasonable steps to ensure that electronic mail and other transmissions passing over the internet are not interfered with by third parties. However, we cannot guarantee the privacy or confidentiality of any information passing over the internet or that such information will not be interfered with.</p>
