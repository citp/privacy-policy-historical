    <h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
    <p>
	Yellow Pages Group Co. together with its subsidiaries “we”, “us”, “YPG“) has created this privacy statement (the “Statement”) is firmly committed to the protection of your privacy. This Statement sets out how we collect, use and secure the personal information of individuals using any website owned by us (each, a “<strong>YPG Website</strong>”). This Statement reflects the requirements of Canada's Federal and Provincial privacy legislation as well as our continuous commitment to protecting your personal information.&nbsp; This Privacy Statement is a simplified version of our Privacy Policy which is accessible by&nbsp;<a href="/images/ckeditor/files/Privacy%20Policy%202009%20.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="link">clicking here</span></a>.</p>
<p>
	The Privacy Policy related to your Yellow Pages Account is a supplement to the Privacy Policy and can be found <a href="http://www.ypg.com/en/privacy-policy-for-use-of-the-yellow-pages-account" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>
	<strong>BY USING A YPG WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY STATEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT, DISCONTINUE ALL USE OF THIS SITE IMMEDIATELY.</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>What is “Personal Information”?</strong></p>
<p>
	Personal information is information about you that uniquely identifies you as an individual. Your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number are all examples of personal information.&nbsp; However, the name, address and telephone number of an individual that appears in a telephone directory that is available to the public (where such individual can refuse to have such information appears in such directory) does not fall under the scope of “personal information as it is publicly available information. Also, in some circumstances, some of this information may qualify as business information which is not covered by this Statement.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Collection of Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>
	We do not automatically gather any personal information from users of YPG Websites. Personal information is only obtained online if you supply it voluntarily, usually through contacting us via e-mail, applying online for a contest, answering online surveys, submitting a posting to a blog, forum, or review or registering for services. You are not required to supply personal information to view the content of any YPG Website.&nbsp; You should also be aware that when you share personal information in public areas of a YPG Website, this information may be seen and used by others users. We urge you to exercise good judgment when sharing personal information in these areas.</p>
<p>
	If you decide not to provide us with personal information online, no material consequences will result, although you may be unable to participate in certain promotions, receive product information, or use portions of a YPG Website that require personalized information or applications. YPG Websites provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request contact information about you.</p>
<p>
	YPG Websites may use cookies to track user traffic patterns. A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them.

YPG does not correlate this information with data about individual users, nor does it share this information or sell it to any third party.&nbsp; We only use cookies to tailor the visitor's experience to the YPG Websites. If you prefer not to receive cookies from a YPG Website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. This could affect the areas of YPG Website that are accessible to you.</p>
<p>
	We may use software that receives and records the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer that has contacted YPG Websites. We make no attempt to link these addresses with the identity of individuals visiting YPG Websites.</p>
<p>
	We may also use service providers to serve third party’s advertisements on YPG Websites or YPG advertisements on other websites. In serving advertisements these providers may place cookies on your browser computer and may collect certain anonymous information about your visits to other websites or on YPG Websites. This information may include browser type, IP address, domain name and the name of the web page from which you entered such websites, web activity and time of day. This information is used by these third parties to better understand and optimize the online advertising campaigns.</p>

We may exchange or merge personal information with data obtained from third parties for the same purposes.</p>
<p>
	Personal information may be shared with our agents or contractors in connection with services that they perform for us. Our written agreements with such agents and contractors ensure that personal information can only be used for the purposes for which it was shared with them, and that they handle the personal information in accordance with this Statement. Some of our agents and contractors are located outside of Canada and, as such, are subject to foreign laws, including laws that may require disclosure of personal information to government agencies in those countries.</p>
