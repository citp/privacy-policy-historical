We may use credit reference (CRA) and fraud prevention (FPA) agencies to help us make decisions before we provide credit to you to allow you to buy advertising. We also buy business information from other organisations. so we may get information about you from those organisations.

A condensed guide to how we, CRA’s and FPA’s will use your information is detailed below. If you would like to see more information about this please call 0800 555 444 and we will send you a leaflet.

  * We may search a CRA and FPA for information on you and your financial associates. If you give us false or inaccurate information and we identify fraud, details may be passed to CRA’s and FPA’s.
  * We may use the information provided to us by CRA’s and FPA’s to help make credit or credit related decisions, to verify your identity, for the prevention and detection of fraud and/ or money laundering, and to manage accounts. We may use scoring methods, which may be automated, to do this. If you borrow for us and do not make payments you owe us, we may trace your whereabouts and recover debts.
  * When CRA’s receive a search from us they will place a search “footprint” on your credit file whether or not your application proceeds.
  * The information which we and other organisations provide to the CRA’s and FPA’s may be supplied by CRA’s to other organisations and used by them to perform similar checks.
