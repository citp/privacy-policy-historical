## **5\. Legal grounds for processing**

Data protection law requires us to only process your personal data if we satisfy one or more legal grounds. These are set out in data protection law and we rely on a number of different grounds for the processing we carry out. These are as follows:

**Consent**  
In certain circumstances, we process your personal data after obtaining your consent to do so for the purposes of:

  * sending you marketing communications about our products and services;
  * sharing your name, email address, postal address and telephone number with our trusted business partners so that they may market to you about their own similar products and services;
  * conducting marketing research;
  * using your location to deliver specific messaging and to you and to facilitate the messaging functionality on our app and websites (as applicable).



**Necessary for the performance of a contract and to comply with our legal obligations**  
It is necessary for us to process your contact details, to set up your account and for the performance of any contract between us: ). In particular, we rely on this legal ground to:

  * where you enter one of our prize draws, competition or promotions;
  * communicate with you about major changes to the terms of this Privacy Policy or to any related or similar information.



In certain circumstances, we also use your personal data only to the extent required in order to enable us to comply with our legal obligations, including to detect, investigate and prevent fraud.

**Necessary for the purposes of our legitimate business interests or those of a third party**  
It is sometimes necessary to collect and use your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a business, which are to:

  * better understand our user base so that we can improve our products and services and marketing activities (which could also benefit you);
  * comply with our contractual obligations to third parties, for example to produce aggregated underwriting risk analysis reports for our commercial lenders and commercial insurers;
  * develop and improve our website to enhance the user experience;
  * train our staff so that we can provide you with a better user service;
  * respond to any enquiries or complaints you have made, or deal with any dispute which may arise in the course of us providing our products and services to you; and
  * ensure effective operational management and internal administration of our business, document retention, compliance with regulatory guidance and exercise or defence of legal claims.



Please note that where we wish to rely on this legal ground for processing, we are required by data protection law to consider whether our legitimate interests are overridden by your interests or your fundamental rights and freedoms. We may continue to process your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests only if we determine that your interests, rights and freedoms are not overridden by our legitimate interests.

We have considered these matters and on balance, we consider that the benefits described above are not outweighed by your interests or your fundamental rights and freedoms.

Where we think there is a risk that one of your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms may be affected we will not process your personal data unless there is another legal ground for us to do so (either that we have obtained your consent to the processing or it is necessary for us to perform our contract with you or to comply with our legal obligations).

## 6\. Who we share your personal data with and where it is stored by them

We may provide your personal data to:

  * our suppliers and services providers, including other companies in our group, who perform certain business services for us and act as “processors” of your personal data on our behalf; and
  * other organisations, who use your personal data for their own purposes and are “controllers” of such data in their own right. Such organisations may be located outside the EEA.



In addition, we may disclose your personal data:

  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to protect the rights, property or safety of our business, our customers or others. This includes, in specific cases, exchanging information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection; and
  * to successors in title or replacement operators of all or part of our business.



In some cases the personal data we collect from you may, for the purposes set out above, be transferred outside the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”) and such destinations may not have laws which protect your personal data to the same extent as in the EEA. We are required by data protection law to ensure that where we or our “processors” transfer your personal data outside the EEA, it is treated securely and is protected against unauthorised access, loss or destruction, unlawful processing and any processing which is inconsistent with the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

The table below sets out details of the third parties to whom we currently disclose your personal data. The table also explains how these organisations use your personal data, whether they are our “processors” or use your personal data for their own purposes once they have received it, any processing they perform outside the EEA, and the safeguards that are used to protect your personal data if this happens. This information may be updated from time to time.

Please ask us if you would like more information about the safeguards that are used to protect your personal data when it is processed outside the EEA (see **How you can contact us**).
