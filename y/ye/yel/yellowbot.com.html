	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p class="legal"><b>Effective October 26, 2007</b></p>

	<p class="legal">Welcome to Solfo, Inc. dba YellowBot and Solfo.com. Please
read this Privacy Policy. Please read our <a href="/about/tos.html">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> carefully before using or
obtaining any content, products or services through our Website(s).</p>

	<h2>Your IP Address</h2>

	<p class="legal">Like most e-commerce websites, each time you visit our
Website(s), we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from
which you came. In order to administer and optimize our Website(s) for you and
to diagnose problems with our Website(s), we use your IP address to help
identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you.</p>

	<h2>Cookies</h2>

	<p class="legal">"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by
your browser on your computer's hard drive. Like most websites, we use cookies
to keep track of your activity on our Website(s) and enhance your experience.
We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save
your password, and if you choose, to save other personal and financial
information so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our
Website(s). A cookie may also be placed by our advertising server. Such
cookies are used for purposes of tracking the effectiveness of advertising
served by us on our. Similarly, a cookie may be placed by our third-party
advertising companies. If you wish to disable these cookies, the "help"
portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set
your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas
or features of the Website(s).</p>

	<h2>Other Information We Collect</h2>

	<p class="legal">When browsing our Website(s), you are not required to
provide any personal information unless and until you choose to sign up for
one of our e-mail newsletters or other services as described below. We do not
knowingly permit our Website(s) to be used by any person under the age of
eighteen and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from
children (meaning those younger than thirteen years of age). We store the data
we collect on our own servers and on servers owned by others. We undertake
ongoing efforts to assure the integrity and security of the data on our
servers, but cannot guarantee that the security measures we employ will always
be completely effective. We also cannot guarantee the absolute security of
data we store on servers owned by others. We will provide notice on our
Website(s) if we have reason to believe the integrity of our stored data has
been breached or compromised, potentially permitting unauthorized
third-parties to access the stored data.</p>

	<h2>Registered User Information</h2>

	<p class="legal">If you choose to become a Registered User of Solfo you must
provide your name, address, e-mail address, a unique login name, password, and
password validation, and a password hint to help you remember your password.
This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons
including: (1) personal identification; (2) to allow us to contact you for
customer service purposes, if necessary; (3) to customize the content of our
Website(s) to meet your specific needs; and (4) to make product improvements
to our Website(s).</p>

	<h2>Automatic Logging of Session Data</h2>

	<p class="legal">We automatically log generic information about your
computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data", that is
anonymous and not linked to any personal information. Session data consists of
things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being
used and the activities conducted by the user while on our Website(s). An IP
address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet, such as our
web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of
the website the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps
us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the
way visitors are clicking through the website, how many visitors are surfing
to various pages on the website, how long visitors to the website are staying
and how often they are visiting. We also record the URLs (Uniform Resource
Locators) of the websites you have visited prior to arriving at our Website(s)
and the URLs of the destinations you visit after you leave our Website(s).
Collecting this information also helps us diagnose problems with our servers
and lets us better administer our systems. You should know it is possible to
determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and
the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
Third-party advertising companies may also employ technology that is used to
measure the effectiveness of ads.</p>

	<h2>Telephone Tracking Data</h2>

	<p class="legal">If a user (including both Registered Users and visitors)
places a telephone call to a number provided by our Website(s), we and/or our
advertising partners may record, track and or meter the telephone number of
originating the call on our own behalf or on behalf of others offering
products or services on our Website(s). We and/or our advertising partners may
also store referring telephone numbers.</p>

	<h2>Other</h2>

	<p class="legal">From time to time we may add or enhance services available
on our Website(s). To the extent these services are provided and used by you,
we will use the information you provide to facilitate the service requested.
For example, if you email us with a question, we will use your email address,
name, nature of the question, etc. to respond to your question. We may also
store such information to assist us in making our Website(s) the better and
easier to use.</p>

	<h2>Information Other Websites Collect From You</h2>

	<p class="legal">On our Website(s), we place links to other web sites
operated by other parties. Some of these other web sites contain our brand
names and trademarks and other intellectual property that we own; others do
not. When you click on these links and visit these other web sites, regardless
of whether or not they contain our brand names, trademarks and other
intellectual property, you need to be aware that we do not control these other
web sites or these other web sites' business practices, and that this privacy
policy does not apply to these other web sites. Consequently, the operators of
these other web sites may collect different kinds of information about you,
and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if
it were collected on our Website(s). We encourage you to review their privacy
policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.</p>

	<h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>

	<p class="legal">When you use our Website(s) or provide us with information,
we may share personal information among our corporate affiliates at Solfo,
Inc. including, but not limited to our affiliates Solfo.com and YellowBot.com.
For example, if you submit a review or rating of a business in your area, we
may share your review with our other Website(s), as well as unaffiliated users
of such data including suppliers, advertisers, affiliates and other current
and potential business partners. We may also use such aggregate data to inform
these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on
links to their web sites. Occasionally, we may hire a third party to act on
our behalf for projects such as market-research surveys and will provide
information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with
these projects.</p>

 <p class="legal">In addition to the circumstances described above, we may
disclose your information as part of a validation process in the interest of
preventing fraud, to provide proper accounting to our business partners (for
“pay-per-click”, “pay-per-call” or “push-to-talk” advertising listings and
related programs) and to validate our business metrics including number of
clicks, referrer logs and other tracking information. We may also disclose
your information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by
other government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief
that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without
limitation, to protect our rights or properties of our affiliated companies or
when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing
interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or
otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. In
addition, if Solfo, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, our
customer information will most likely also be transferred in connection with
such acquisition.</p>

	<h2>Demographic Information and Saved Listings</h2>

	<p class="legal">We use demographic and listing information Saved Listings to
customize our Website(s) and communications to the interests of our users. We
may share demographic information and Saved Listings with advertisers and
other third parties so that they can target their advertisements and
communications to the appropriate audience. Demographic and listing data we
provide to advertisers and other third parties may be linked to information
you have provided as a Registered User so that advertisers and third parties
can target the offerings presented to you. We may capture, correct, enhance,
extrapolate and store additional information and data based on information you
supply, including without limitation data relating to your geographic
location, IP address and provider, email and other demographic information. We
may also enhance the information we collect from you with additional
information collected by third parties to correct, match, enhance or complete
the data you have provided. We may store and share this enhanced information
on an individual or aggregated basis.</p>

	<h2>How We Use Public Information, Reviews, Ratings and Registered User Names</h2>

	<p class="legal">When you become a Registered User, you must enter a user
name. Our Website(s) provide you with the opportunity to give user reviews and
ratings for restaurants, hotels, bars, events and other businesses. Your
Registered User name and information may appear next to your user reviews and
ratings as they are posted on our Website(s). Your Registered User name and
information may also appear on a Registered User Profile section of our
Website(s). We may also use and disclose your Registered User name,
information and reviews and ratings in any other manner. To read further
details about how we may use your user name, information and reviews, see our
Terms of and Conditions of Use.</p>

	<h2>Opt Out</h2>

	<p class="legal">At any time, you can unsubscribe being a Registered User by
clicking on the “unsubscribe” link and following the instructions. We reserve
the right to limit our Registered Users to those who provide us with a valid
email address and agree to accept e-mails. Registered Users will be notified
via e-mail prior to any actions taken.</p>

	<p class="legal">After you submit personal information in connection with
becoming a Registered User or other programs (such as discount or rewards
programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on our Website(s), we may use
such information to send you marketing emails. However, if we do so, we will
provide a link that you can click on to opt-out of receiving subsequent
marketing emails generated from the same such information.</p>

	<p class="legal">Please note that changing or deleting your information
otherwise opting-out of receipt of email communications from us will only
change or delete the data for purposes of future activity on our Website(s)
and for managing future communications. These changes and deletions will not
change or delete information that we may have already forwarded to our
affiliates or any other third parties, all as provided above in this privacy
policy. This includes any user reviews, user ratings or other user-generated
data previously provided to us.</p>

policy, the practices of our Website(s), or your dealings with the Website(s),
you can contact us as indicated below:</p>
