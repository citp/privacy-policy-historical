												<strong>Introduction</strong></span><br>
											YellowAssistance.com is committed to protecting your online privacy while 
											providing you with the most useful and enjoyable Web experience possible. 
											Generally speaking, you can use YellowAssistance.com without giving us any 
											information about yourself. When we do need your personal information to 
											provide additional and/or optional services that you request, such as My Place, 
											this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information. 
											YellowAssistance.com respects your right to personal privacy, and we will 
											collect and use information through our Web site only in the ways disclosed in 
											this statement. Rest assured your information will not be sold to anyone one 
											for any purpose.
											<br>
											<br>
											<span class="Arial14Bold">Part I: Information Collection</span>
											<br>
											<br>
											<span class="Verdana12">
												<em>General Overview</em></span><em><br>
											</em>
											<br>
											For the most part, you will not need to provide any private, personally 
											identifiable information to use YellowAssistance.com. unless you choose to 
											register as a user. You may elect to Set Your Address so that our search can 
											provide listings in distance order based on where you live instead of the 
											Geo-center of a city of zip code.</font></p>
									<p><font color="#ffffff">In the course of normal operation, our algorithms do collect 
											and process a large number of not personally identifiable, information such as 
											traffic patterns, clickstream logs, IP addresses, browser type, browser 
											language, and the date and time of your visits. However, we do not correlate 
											this information with data about individual users. This information is used 
											primarily to operate our service, and at times, to develop and improve our 
											services further. </font>
									</p>
									<p><font color="#ffffff">We do track and catalog the search terms that users enter in 
											our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual 
											users. We use this tracking information to determine and continuously refine 
											the relevancy of our search results as well as to analyze which areas of our 
											sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. This helps us 
											continue to build a better search tool for you.</font></p>
									<p><font color="#ffffff"><em>Registration</em></font></p>
									<p><font color="#ffffff">Some of our additional and/or optional services may require 
											registering for an account. For such services, we may ask you for some 
											personally identifiable information in order to create an account and to 
											provide the service. If we require personally identifiable information for such 
											services, it will only be used to identify and ensure you are the account 
											holder. It will not be used for any other purposes other than reasons that are 
											not specifically listed on the site. </font>
									</p>
									<p class="Verdana12"><em><font color="#ffffff">Cookies</font></em></p>
									<p><font color="#ffffff">As you probably know, "cookies" are small pieces of 
											information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you 
											visit them. YellowAssistance.com uses cookies as the basis for a number of 
											personalized and/or customized features. Most Web browsers automatically accept 
											cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject 
											cookies on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, you can reset your browser at any 
											time to refuse or delete all cookies. However, some YellowAssistance.com 
											features or services may not function properly without cookies. </font>
									</p>
									<p class="Arial14Bold"><font color="#ffffff">Part II: Information Security</font></p>
									<p><font color="#ffffff">YellowAssistance.com takes information security very 
											seriously. We protect user information with a number of security and technology 
											measures in order to prevent unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, 
											disclosure or destruction of data. Furthermore, we strictly limit access to 
											your personally identifying information only to those employees on a strict 
											need-to-know basis in order to operate, develop or improve our services. </font>
									</p>
									<p class="Arial14Bold"><font color="#ffffff">Part III: Third Party Sites</font></p>
									<p><font color="#ffffff">We offer links to other Web sites. Please note that third 
											party sites may have privacy standards that differ from ours. We do not control 
											the content on any third party site, and we encourage you to read the privacy 
											policies on third party sites when you click on their links. These other sites 
											may place their own cookies on your computer and/or collect personally 
											identifiable information. </font>
									</p>
									<p class="Arial14Bold"><font color="#ffffff">Part IV: Changes to this Privacy Policy</font></p>
									<p><font color="#ffffff">This policy is likely to evolve throughout time. Any changes 
											or updates to our privacy policy will be posted on this page so that you are 
											always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
											circumstances we disclose it.
