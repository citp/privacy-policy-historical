__ **The Way We Use Information:**__

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete the order.  We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.  For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of woman filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
