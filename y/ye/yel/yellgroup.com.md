# Yell: Privacy Policy

Yell places great importance on your privacy. It is important for us to safeguard your privacy while providing a valuable and personalised service. Accordingly, we have established a privacy policy. This statement explains our policy and our data protection practices. 

**What information do we compile and for what purpose?**  
As you navigate through Yellgroup.com your browsing activity is automatically retrieved. This is used online in aggregate form: no individual registered user is identified. This aggregated data allows us to analyse site traffic and thus improve on the relevancy of services provided for you. For instance, based on the choices you make as you visit the site, we may want to recommend information that will be of interest to you. We may also provide "aggregated" statistics about users to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will not include information that would allow the recipient to identify any particular individual.

When you submit an enquiry we may ask for some personal details. This is so that we can contact you regarding your query.

**What about security?**  
We take the security of your personal data extremely seriously. As required by the UK Data Protection Act of 1998, we follow strict security procedures with regard to the storage and disclosure of any information that you have given us, thus preventing access to this information by an unauthorised user.

**Cookie Use**  
Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on particular sites, thus enabling Web site owners to provide more useful features for their users. (The use of cookies is an industry standard.) Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so.
