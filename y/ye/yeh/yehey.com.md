**Privacy Policy**  


YEHEY! is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. 

**What personally identifiable information does YEHEY! collect from me?**

YEHEY! collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites. 

Some personal information is gathered when you register. Upon registration, YEHEY! asks for your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to YEHEY! - you are given a YEHEY! ID and are able to take full advantage of YEHEY!'s many offerings.

In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by YEHEY! and/or our many partners; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you constantly keep in contact with yehey! we may keep a record of that correspondence. YEHEY! also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever Yehey! collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

**What are cookies and how does YEHEY! use them?**

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, YEHEY! uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on YEHEY! where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. (See _"What are my choices regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?"_ for more information on cookies.) 

Generally, we use cookies to: 

(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services. YEHEY! also uses cookies to store your zip code for other services, such as Yellow Pages. 

(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing YEHEY! is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior. 

(3) Assist merchants to track visits to and business at their stores. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant's store. 

(4) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a YEHEY!-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings. 

(5) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of YEHEY!'s network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on YEHEY! a better one.YEHEY! a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites. 

Advertising networks that serve ads onto YEHEY! may also use their own cookies. 

YEHEY! also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. In addition, yehey! Mail includes IP addresses in outgoing mail message headers. 

**How does YEHEY! use my information?**

YEHEY!'s primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, YEHEY! is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. 

In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, YEHEY! plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). YEHEY! takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only yehey! has access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email. You will only receive special offers via email from YEHEY! if you have indicated in your account preferences that you would like to receive them. You can change your account preferences at any time. 

YEHEY! does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. yehey! may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners. 

**Who is collecting information?**

When you are on a YEHEY! site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with YEHEY! alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. For example, some yehey! services, like yehey! Jobs, are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner company. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than yehey!, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. 

Promotions that run on YEHEY! may be sponsored by companies other than YEHEY! or may be cosponsored by yehey! and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared. Currently, most yehey! promotions are limited to Philippine residents. 

Please be aware that YEHEY! advertisers or web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those web sites linked to YEHEY! are not covered by this privacy statement.

YEHEY! may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from YEHEY! and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only YEHEY! (or agents working on behalf of YEHEY! and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers.

Occasionally these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements. 

You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those YEHEY! services that require registration in order to participate. 

YEHEY! does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests.

This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Yehey! cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

**What else should I know about my privacy?**

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas \- that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
