          does YEHEY! use my information?</b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">YEHEY!'s 
          primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the 
          user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes 
          personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping 
          and many other types of services, most of which are completely free 
          to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. 
          By knowing a little about you, YEHEY! is able to deliver more relevant 
          advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In our 
          role of delivering targeted advertisements, YEHEY! plays the middleman. 
          Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience 
          they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). YEHEY! takes 
          the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In 
          this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account 
          information. Only yehey! has access to individuals' accounts. This kind 
          of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional 
          email. You will only receive special offers 
          via email from YEHEY! if you have indicated in your account preferences 
          that you would like to receive them. You can change your account preferences 
          at any time. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">YEHEY! 
          does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based 
          on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, 
          from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand 
          and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated 
          basis. yehey! may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business 
          partners. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000099"><b>Who 
          is collecting information?</b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">When you 
          are on a
		   YEHEY! site and are asked for personal information, you are 
          sharing that information with YEHEY! alone, unless it is specifically 
          stated otherwise. For example, some yehey! services, like yehey! Jobs, 
          are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide 
          this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share your 
          personal information with our partner company. If data is being collected 
          and/or maintained by any company other than yehey!, you will be notified 
          prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not 
          want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer 
          by not using that particular service. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Promotions 
          that run on YEHEY! may be sponsored by companies other than YEHEY! or 
          may be cosponsored by yehey! and another company. Some or all data collected 
          during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, 
          you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. 
          You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want 
          your data to be shared. Currently, most yehey! promotions are limited 
          to Philippine residents. </font></p>
