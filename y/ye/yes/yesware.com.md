This Privacy/Data Protection Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how Yesware, Inc. (“Yesware”, “we”, “our” or “us”) collects and uses the information, including personal data, that you share when you use www.yesware.com and its associated domains (together, the “Site”), as well as the information, software or services made available to you through the Site (collectively, “Services”). Except where otherwise expressly indicated in this Privacy Policy or on the Site, this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Site and through the Services. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Data and how you can access and update this information.

If you are outside the United States when you visit the Site or engage in communications with a Yesware agent via mail, e-mail or telephone, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. As you are contracting for the Services with Yesware, which is a US company, any information you provide to us, or that we collect through your use of the Services and that is necessary to provide you with the Services, will be stored, processed, and transferred within, or to, the United States. Please be aware that the US and jurisdictions other than the one in which you are located may have a lower standard of data protection laws compared to your own jurisdiction.

### Information We Collect

We collect the information that you share with us, including:
