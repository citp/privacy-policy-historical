# YesVideo - Privacy Statement

We at YesVideo respect your right to privacy and have a firm commitment to safeguarding our customers' personal information. YesVideo will not rent, sell, or share any information regarding any individual customer (such as name, address, e-mail address or credit cards numbers) to any third party other than under the terms outlined in this privacy statement. 

YesVideo collects information from you at several different points on our website. By using our services, you consent to the collection and use of information as described below. If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

YesVideo may disclose information it has collected from any member of the YesVideo Site ("Member") and/or content any Member has made available on the YesVideo Site when it believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or when it is necessary to do so to protect the rights or property of YesVideo or others. 

**Third Party Service Providers**  
We may share your personally identifiable information with those companies that assist us in providing our service to you. Following are some examples of our use of third party service providers: We may share personally identifiable information with third parties that assist us with the administration of our newsletters or contests or that help us understand the results of particular surveys we may perform. We may also engage third parties to assist us by tracking the number of visitors to the YesVideo site that have "clicked-through" from specified promotions on third party Web sites and those visitors' activities on the YesVideo Site. We may also choose to offer certain third party products through the YesVideo Site and may disclose certain portions of your personally identifiable information (not including credit card information) to allow those vendors to fulfill your product order. 

**Cookies**  
YesVideo's cookies do not contain any personal information about you. They contain a unique identifier that only we can match up with your personal information, which allows you to use member-related features on our site. Our cookies expire when you log off our site, or after 30 minutes of inactivity on our site. 

**IP Address**  
We analyze IP addresses in the aggregate for system administration purposes and to gather broad demographic information. We do not link IP addresses to your computer's User ID. If you entered the YesVideo Site by clicking a link or promotion on another Web site (including a YesVideo co-branded portion of another Web site), we will store the ID of that affiliate site in our database along with your computer's User ID. We do this to ensure that the affiliate site receives proper credit for any subsequent order you might place. We may also use this information in conjunction with your activities on our site to help us identify what offers and services may be of interest to you. 

**Sharing**  
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

**Links**  
This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we, YesVideo, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**Security**  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected. 

When our registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry \- SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [support@yesvideo.com](mailto:support@yesvideo.com). 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:**  
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code) we will endeavor to provide a way to correct or update or your personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the user profile page or by e-mailing our Customer Support. 

**Choice/Opt-out**  
You are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' of having your information used for purposes not directly related to at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-in' mechanism so users who buy products or services from us, and want to receive marketing materials, surveys or other e-mail communication, can include their e-mail address in our lists. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by either changing their user profile or replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [support@yesvideo.com](mailto:support@yesvideo.com). 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will post a notification of that change on this page. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
