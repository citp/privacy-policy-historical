**YesVideo Partners and Affiliates**  
YesVideo may disclose users’ Personal Data to third party business partners or affiliates who provide specific services to the user along with the Service (such as hosting or other support services).

However, if we disclose your Personal Data to a third party business partner or affiliate that you are reasonably unaware of, then YesVideo will require that such third party’s privacy policy is at least as strong as YesVideo’s; otherwise, users will be provided with a mechanism to opt-out of having their Personal Data viewed by such third parties.

YesVideo may disclose Personal Data, including the information or data uploaded to the Service, with or without notice (a) if required by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, (b) where required by law, or (c) at our sole discretion, where we deem it necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the general public or to prevent violation of our Terms and Conditions of Use, this Privacy Policy or the rights of YesVideo or any third party.
