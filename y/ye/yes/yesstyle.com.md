# YESSTYLE: Customer Support - Privacy & Security

Last Updated: April 10, 2012

YesStyle.com is committed to protecting your privacy. We hope that you will take the time to read this privacy policy, which explains what information we collect from you and how we use that information. By using our website (including its subdomains) or by purchasing products or services from us, you agree to be bound by this privacy policy. Please check back frequently, as this privacy policy may change from time to time. 

**What information we collect and how we use it**

When you visit our website, YesStyle.com collects your IP address, which we use to improve our products and services as well as to help us administer our website and diagnose technical problems. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you. To receive our website's newsletters and/or periodic email notifications with special offers, you only need to leave your email address with us. However, to order from us, you must set up a YesStyle.com account by providing us with your name, email address and a chosen password. These constitute your "Account Information". Account Information also includes any information that you may provide to us in response to customer surveys. When you place an order with us, we will also collect your shipping address and telephone number, as well as credit card number, billing address, and card expiration date, if applicable. This information constitutes your "Order Information". Order Information is necessary for us both to process your order and notify you of your order status. Order Information also includes any information that you provide us in connection with an order that you later cancel or that is not completed for any reason. We may use your Account Information and Order Information to occasionally notify you about important changes to our website, new YesStyle.com features, special YesStyle.com offers that you may find useful, or offers from companies with whom we have business relationships. We may also contact you if you have entered one of our contests or sweepstakes, or responded to one of our surveys. Choosing not to receive email newsletters or email notifications from us when you enter a contest or sweepstakes will not affect your chances of winning. If you would prefer not to receive email newsletters or email notifications from us (other than email notifications relating to order processing), simply visit the "Preferences" section of "My Account". From here, select "Newsletter Subscriptions" and/or "Personalized Email Reminders and Special Offer Email Subscriptions," indicate which newsletters or email notifications you wish to unsubscribe from, and then click the "Update" button. 

**How we protect your information**

To protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control we have implemented security measures at this website.

When you place orders or access your account information, a secure server is employed. All information you input is encrypted by the secure server layer (SSL) before it is sent to us and all the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorised access. 

**Limited sharing of information**

Except as described in this privacy policy, YesStyle.com will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or the disclosure is necessary to: 

  1. Comply with the law or with legal process, or with requests from law enforcement authorities; 
  2. Protect and defend our rights and property; 
  3. Protect our customers or users from misuse or unauthorised use of the YesStyle.com website; or 
  4. Protect the personal safety or property of our customers or the public. 



YesStyle.com may share your personal information with other companies in our corporate group.

Your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if YesStyle.com has not provided such information. Each Application's privacy policy (and not this privacy policy) will govern information collected by such Application. In addition, YesStyle.com may allow you to log in to portions of our website using "Facebook Connect" an Application of Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook") and may allow you to use other Facebook Applications and features, such as a "Like" button, so that you may use information from your Facebook account on our website and share activities and other information related to our website via Facebook.com.

**Children's privacy online**

At YesStyle.com, we believe that the privacy of children is important. 

We do not monitor the age of our user audience except in connection with surveys and contests, and except for age data optionally provided by users who wish to customise their account preferences, However, visitors and users under the age of thirteen (13) should not submit personal identifying information to YesStyle.com without the consent of their parent(s) or guardian(s). If a user is under the age of thirteen (13) the user may not, even under the supervision of a parent or guardian, make any submissions of content to YesStyle.com or the YesStyle.com website. 

If you are a parent and want to limit your children's access to material you believe may be harmful to them, you may want to look into commercially available hardware, software and filtering devices. Relevant information can be found at <http://www.safetysurf.com/> and other similar sites.
