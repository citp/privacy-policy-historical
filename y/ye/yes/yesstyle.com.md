**What Information We Collect**

_Information You Give Us_

We collect personal information from you in a variety of ways when you interact with our website. Some examples are when you: 

  * Create a YesStyle account;   

  * Sign up to receive our website's newsletters and/or periodic email notifications with special offers;   

  * Place an order with us;   

  * Participate in a contest, sweepstake, giveaway, promotion, or survey; or  

  * Otherwise submit personal information to us along with any related content of the communication.



_Information Automatically Collected_

We receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us. Our purpose is to allow the websites to work correctly, to evaluate use of the website, and to support website analytics and marketing campaigns. Some examples include: 

  * We may collect technical information such as your IP address, your device operating system and browser type, the address of a referring website, if any, and the path you take through our websites. We use this technical information to, among other things, improve our products and services as well as to help us administer our website and diagnose technical problems. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you.
  * We use “cookies” to recognise you as you use or return to our site. For more information about cookies, please see the section below “Cookies.” 



**How We Use Your Information**

We use your information to offer and provide our products and services and to support our core business functions. These include order or service fulfillment, internal business processes, marketing, authentication, loss and fraud prevention, public safety and legal functions. Some examples include: 

  * To fulfill your requests for products and services and communicate with you about those requests;  

  * To register and service your account;  

  * To administer surveys, sweepstakes, contests, giveaways and promotions;  

  * To provide customer service and alert you to product information;  

  * To help us improve and customise our product and service offerings, websites, and advertising;  

  * To send you information about our products, services, and promotions; and  

  * To protect the security or integrity of our websites and our business.



**How We Protect Your Information**

To protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control we have implemented security measures on our website.

When you place orders or access your account information, a secure server is employed. All information you input is encrypted by the secure server layer (SSL) before it is sent to us and all the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorised access. 

YesStyle cannot be and is not responsible for unauthorised access to information by hackers or others who have obtained such access through illegal measures.

“Phishing” is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it might be from YesStyle asking for your personal information, do not respond. YesStyle would not request your password, user name, credit card information, or other personal information through e-mail.

**How We Share Your Information**

Except as described in this privacy policy, YesStyle will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or under the following limited circumstances.

_Within Our Corporate Group_

YesStyle may share your personal information with other companies in our corporate group.

_Legal Requirements and Protection of Our Company and Others_

YesStyle may also share your personal information for the following limited purposes:

  1. Comply with the law or with legal process, or with requests from law enforcement authorities;   

  2. Protect and defend our rights and property;   

  3. Protect our customers or users from misuse or unauthorised use of the YesStyle website; or   

  4. Protect the personal safety or property of our customers or the public. 



_Business Transfers_

If YesStyle is acquired by or merges with another company, YesStyle may transfer personal information to that company (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings). In such an event, YesStyle will notify you before your personal data is transferred if this information would become subject to a materially different privacy policy.

_Service Providers_

YesStyle may from time to time share the information we collect from and about you with other third-parties that provide support services to us, or that help us market our products and services. Examples are shipping vendors, billing and refund vendors, payment card processors, promoters and administrators of sweepstakes, contests, giveaways and promotions, and companies that help us improve our product and service offerings and our websites. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorised to use the information we share with them for any other purpose. In some cases YesStyle and third-party service providers may share tracking information, including your IP address, and YesStyle may provide information about your order to the website that has referred you to YesStyle (and the referral network utilised by such website), to facilitate calculation of any commissions payable by YesStyle.

YesStyle may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related website information to third parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information. A website traffic and user behavior auditing system operated by Google Analytics is being used on this website. Please see the [Google Analytics website](http://www.google.com/analytics) for information about Google Analytics, the Google Analytics auditing system, and the Google Analytics' [privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/privacy.html).
