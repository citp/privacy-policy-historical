**How We Protect Your Information and How Long We Keep Your Information**

To protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control we have implemented security measures on our website.

When you place orders or access your account information, a secure server is employed. All information you input is encrypted by the secure server layer (SSL) before it is sent to us and all the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorised access. 

YesAsia cannot be and is not responsible for unauthorised access to information by hackers or others who have obtained such access through illegal measures.

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it might be from YesAsia asking for your personal information, do not respond. YesAsia would not request your password, user name, credit card information, or other personal information through e-mail.

We will only store your information as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information is collected and processed or, where applicable law provides for longer storage and retention periods, for the storage and retention period required by law. After that your personal information will be deleted.

**How We Share Your Information**

Except as described in this privacy policy, YesAsia will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or under the following limited circumstances.

_Within Our Corporate Group_

YesAsia may share your personal information with other companies in our corporate group.

_We have a legitimate interest in sharing your information for internal administrative purposes, in particular to offer the products and services on our website and mobile app and to deal with any inquiries in an efficient and high-quality manner. If you or the relevant Data Controller are located in the EEA, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to such sharing. To exercise this right you may at any time contact us as provided under "How To Contact Us" below._

_Business Transfers_

If YesAsia is acquired by or merges with another company, YesAsia may transfer personal information to that company (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings). In such an event, YesAsia will notify you before your personal information is transferred if this information would become subject to a materially different privacy policy. 

_Service Providers_

YesAsia may from time to time share the information we collect from and about you with other third-parties that provide support services to us, or that help us market our products and services. Examples are shipping vendors, billing and refund vendors, payment card processors, promoters and administrators of sweepstakes, contests, giveaways and promotions, and companies that help us improve our product and service offerings and our websites. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorised to use the information we share with them for any other purpose. In some cases YesAsia and third-party service providers may share tracking information, including your IP address, and YesAsia may provide information about your order to the website that has referred you to YesAsia (and the referral network utilised by such website), to facilitate calculation of any commissions payable by YesAsia.

_Aggregate Information_

YesAsia may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related website information to third parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information. 

**Registering for a YesAsia Account with your Social Media Login**

By registering with your login information of a third-party social networking service such as Facebook or Google Plus (each an “ **SNS** ”), you allow YesAsia to access certain information from your profile for that SNS. The information you allow YesAsia to access is affected by the privacy settings you and your friends establish at the SNS. You can control and find out more about these settings directly from the SNS. For example, YesAsia may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your preferences:

  * Your first and last name;
  * Your SNS ID;
  * The URL of your SNS profile; 
  * Your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile photo
  * The user ID numbers and other public data for your friends;
  * The login e-mail you provided to that SNS when you registered; and
  * Your gender.

  
In addition, if you are a member of an SNS, YesAsia may also enable you to log in through an interface provided by that SNS. If you log in to YesAsia using an SNS, we may receive the personal and non-personal information that you have provided (or provide in the future) to that SNS, and you consent to YesAsia receiving such information.

You may be able to specify what information is provided by the SNS to YesAsia using the privacy settings in your SNS profile information.

By logging in to the YesAsia website through an SNS such as Facebook, you permit such SNS to check your SNS account cookies when you are visiting our website and to receive information concerning actions you take on the website.
