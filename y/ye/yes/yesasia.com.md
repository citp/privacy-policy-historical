# YesAsia.com: Customer Support

****

Last Updated: Jan 5, 2007 

YesAsia.com is committed to protecting your privacy. We hope that you will take the time to read this policy, which explains what information we collect from you and how we use that information. By using our website or by purchasing products or services from us, you agree to be bound by this policy. Please check back frequently, as this policy may change from time to time. 

_What information we collect and how we use it_  
When you visit our website, YesAsia.com collects your IP address, which we use to improve our products and services as well as to help us administer our website and diagnose technical problems. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you. To receive our website's newsletters and/or periodic email notifications with special offers, you only need to leave your email address with us. However, to order from us, you must set up a YesAsia.com account by providing us with your name, email address and a chosen password. These constitute your "Account Information". Account Information also includes any information that you may provide to us in response to customer surveys. When you place an order with us, we will also collect your shipping address and telephone number, as well as credit card number, billing address, and card expiration date, if applicable. This information constitutes your "Order Information". Order Information is necessary for us both to process your order and notify you of your order status. Order Information also includes any information that you provide us in connection with an order that you later cancel or that is not completed for any reason. We may use your Account Information and Order Information to occasionally notify you about important changes to the website, new YesAsia.com features, special YesAsia.com offers that you may find useful, or offers from companies with whom we have business relationships. We may also contact you if you have entered one of our contests or sweepstakes, or responded to one of our surveys. Choosing not to receive email newsletters or email notifications from us when you enter a contest or sweepstakes will not affect your chances of winning. If you would prefer not to receive email newsletters or email notifications from us (other than email notifications relating to order processing), simply visit the "Preferences" section of "My Account". From here, select "Newsletter Subscriptions" and/or "Personalized Email Reminders and Special Offer Email Subscriptions," indicate which newsletters or email notifications you wish to unsubscribe from, and then click the "Update" button. _How we protect your information  
_ To protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control we have implemented security measures at this website.   
When you place orders or access your account information, a secure server is employed. All information you input is encrypted by the secure server layer (SSL) before it is sent to us and all the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorized access. 

YesAsia.com will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or the disclosure is necessary to: 

(1) Comply with the law or with legal process, or with requests from law enforcement authorities;  
(2) Protect and defend our rights and property;  
(3) Protect our customers or users from misuse or unauthorized use of the YesAsia.com website; or   
(4) Protect the personal safety or property of our customers or the public. 

YesAsia.com may share your personal information with other companies in our corporate group.  Also, if YesAsia.com is acquired by or merges with another company, YesAsia.com may transfer personal information to that company. In such an event, YesAsia.com will notify you before your personal data is transferred if this information would become subject to a materially different privacy policy. 

YesAsia.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related website information to third parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information. Put simply, while we will not tell our business partners that a particular individual bought a particular product, we may, for example, tell them how many customers within certain demographic groups bought certain products. 

A website traffic and user behavior auditing system operated by NetRatings, Inc. is being used on this website. Please see [NetRatings' website](http://www.netratings.com/privacy.jsp?section=leg_scs) for information about NetRatings, the NetRatings auditing system, and NetRatings' privacy policy. The NetRatings system is not intended to collect personally identifiable information; however, from time to time such information may inadvertently be obtained by NetRatings. NetRatings has assured us that it will not use such personally identifiable information for any purpose (other than as part of aggregate data that is not personally identifiable) or share it with any other person or entity.

 _Third-party ad servers or networks_  
YesAsia.com allows other companies, sometimes called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our website. These companies use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements that appear on our site. YesAsia.com will not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that these companies will have access to your IP address and information that is not personally identifiable. In addition, these third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technologies such as cookies, JavaScript, clear GIFs, “action tags” or “web beacons” to track your behavior and preferences within our site, measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and personalize the advertising content they provide.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (please see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of their activities. Please note that YesAsia.com's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, these other companies.

Our affiliates or advertisers may also use cookies and though YesAsia.com encourages anyone who uses cookies to follow appropriate privacy standards and policies, it is not responsible for cookies placed by third parties.

 _Children's privacy online_  
At YesAsia.com, we believe that the privacy of children is important.  
We do not monitor the age of our user audience except in connection with surveys and contests, and except for age data optionally provided by users who wish to customize their account preferences, However, visitors and users under the age of thirteen (13) should not submit personal identifying information to YesAsia.com without the consent of their parent(s) or guardian(s).

If you are a parent and want to limit your children's access to material you believe may be harmful to them, you may want to look into commercially available hardware, software and filtering devices. Relevant information can be found at [http://www.safetysurf.com](http://www.safetysurf.com/) and other similar sites.
