# YesButNoButYes: Privacy Policy

YesButNoButYes.com respects each individual user's right to privacy. We collect NO personal information, except a user's name and email address if supplied via our comment system or email subscription request function. We only collect phone numbers if they're written on matchbooks and passed to us in sweaty nightclubs, and even then, we don't make any promises to call you back, at least for a few days. 

We only use cookies in one instance - to simplify the commenting process by storing your details on your own computer (but only if you choose). Some of the companies who provide advertising on this site also use cookies, and you should be aware that we cannot control the use of these cookies and the resulting information by advertisers or other third parties. You do not need to have cookies enabled to visit YesButNoButYes. Just a sense of humor.

Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information (e.g., number of users from Boise, Idaho). We do not monitor individual traffic patterns on our site, only aggregate behavior. To be honest, Google Analytics is so complicated, even we don't really understand it. Suffice to say, more traffic arrives here from the search term "Star Wars Porn" than any other phrase. Which - if we ever write a book about the history of the Internet - would be the perfect title. 

Basic stats for our site are available from the [Sitemeter link](http://www.sitemeter.com/stats.asp?site=sm3scaramouch) at the bottom of every page, and are available for all to read. Read it and weep - makes your own 25 visitors a day look a bit meaningless, right? Information from our more detailed server logs are NEVER shared with third parties, but they're even more splendid. Trust us. 

This site contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. (And that includes how funny they may or may not be, especially if it's on cracked.com.) 

Finally, if any of you people have a problem with any of that, then you better email us at [webmaster@yesbutnobutyes.com](maito:webmaster@yesbutnobutyes.com). (But then, of course, we'll know exactly who you are.)
