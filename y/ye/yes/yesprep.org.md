Our Commitment To Privacy
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our
online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected
and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point
where personally identifiable information may be requested.
The Information We Collect:
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the YES Prep Public Schools’ website.
On some pages, you can make donations and/or sign up to receive periodic communication. The types of
personal information collected at these pages are:
         Name
         Address
         Email address
         Phone number
         Credit/Debit Card Information, etc.
On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online
and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In this
circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:
         Name
         Address
The Way We Use Information:
We use the information you provide about yourself on our website to communicate with you in the way
you indicate, or to acknowledge donations. We never publish or share your personal information with
outside parties. The only exception to this is the use of your first and last name in donor
acknowledgement areas on our website or at one of our campuses. Your gift amount or other personal
information will not be included in this recognition. If you choose to make your gift anonymous, your
name will not appear in any acknowledgements or lists that we make public.
We use the information you provide about someone else when requesting a card be sent to them only to
only to fulfill that request. We do not share this information with outside parties.
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other


purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with
advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on
our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways
unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise
prohibit such unrelated uses.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we
have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure
the information we collect online. To further protect your personal information, we do not store any
bank account information and we only have access to the last four digits of your credit card number once
it processes through our Transfirst online payment system.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or
maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our
website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by
contacting our office at 713-967-9000 to request it. We use this procedure to better safeguard your
information.

take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
