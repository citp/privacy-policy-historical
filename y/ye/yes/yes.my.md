Effective Date of these Online Terms Of Use: 10 November 2009

This Privacy Policy explains how YTL Communications Sdn Bhd ("YTL Communications") including its subsidiaries and affiliates (together referred to as "YTL Communications Group"), handles the personal information that you provide to us on web sites controlled by YTL Communications which link to this Privacy Policy (together referred to as "YTL Communications Web Site(s)"). Unless otherwise specifically noted, this Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information collected from you offline, or to third-party web sites to which YTL Communications Web Sites may link save as otherwise provided herein. Your use of YTL Communications Web Sites is subject to this Privacy Policy and the Online Terms of Use.

Please read this Privacy Policy before using YTL Communications Web Sites or submitting personal information to us.

What is "personal information" as used in this Privacy Policy?

"Personal information" means information that identifies you or could be used to identify you and which is submitted to and/or collected by YTL Communications Web Sites. Examples of personal information include your name, your postal address, your e-mail address and your telephone number.

How does YTL Communications collect information online?

YTL Communications collects information in two ways: 

  1. Personal Information You Submit:  
YTL Communications collects personal information that you enter into data fields on YTL Communications Web Sites. For example, you may submit your name, postal address, e-mail address, and/or other information in order to receive information about various subjects, register for YTL Communications programmes, contact YTL Communications customer service, or respond to YTL Communications surveys. To protect your privacy, you should not provide YTL Communications with any information that is not specifically requested.
  2. Passive Collection of Unidentifiable Information:  
YTL Communications Web Sites may collect information about your visits to YTL Communications Web Sites without you actively submitting such information. Unidentifiable information may be collected using various technologies, such as cookies, and web beacons. Cookies are small text files that are transferred to your computer's hard disk by a website. Web beacons (also referred to as GIF files, pixels or Internet tags) help YTL Communications recognise a unique cookie on your browser. Your Internet browser automatically transmits to YTL Communications Web Sites some of this unidentifiable information, such as the URL of the web site you just visited and the browser version your computer is operating. Passive information collection technologies can make your use of YTL Communications Web Sites easier by allowing YTL Communications to provide better service, customise YTL Communications Web Sites based on consumer preferences, compile statistics, analyse trends, and otherwise administer and improve YTL Communications Web Sites. Certain features of YTL Communications Web Sites may not work without use of passive information collection technologies. Information collected by these technologies cannot be used to identify you without additional identifiable information and YTL Communications will not connect additional identifiable information with information collected through the use of such tracking technologies. With respect to limiting or disabling tracking technology please see below "What choices do I have about how YTL Communications collects and uses personal information about me?"



In what circumstances and for what purposes might YTL Communications collect and use personal information?

YTL Communications will use the personal information you provide through YTL Communications Web Sites to respond to your questions and to provide you with efficient customer service. After you have entered personal information into a form or data field on any YTL Communications Web Site, YTL Communications may use certain identifying technologies to allow that YTL Communications Web Site to "remember" your personal preferences. We will only use your personal information for other business purposes, such as to offer you the opportunity to receive notices regarding YTL Communications' products or services.

Does YTL Communications consolidate personal information?

YTL Communications may consolidate the personal information of customers who use YTL Communications Web Sites. In addition, we may consolidate information in a non-identifiable form (aggregate/anonymous data) to help us better design YTL Communications Web Sites and YTL Communications products, to enhance our research activities, and to facilitate other business functions.

What choices do I have about how YTL Communications collects and uses personal information about me?

You may always limit the amount and type of personal information that YTL Communications receives about you by choosing not to enter any personal information into forms or data fields on YTL Communications Web Sites. Some of our online services can only be provided to you if you provide us with appropriate personal information. Other parts of YTL Communications Web Sites may ask whether you wish to opt into our contact lists for offers, promotions and additional services that may be of interest to you.

You may also be provided with preference questions or preference boxes allowing you to indicate that you do not want YTL Communications Web Sites to use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to "remember" your personal information, such as mailing addresses, on return visits. However, YTL Communications Web Sites that use tracking technologies to collect unidentifiable information do not generally provide you with the ability to opt out of the tracking technologies. Some Internet browsers allow you to limit or disable the use of tracking technologies that collect unidentifiable information.

Who will have access to personal information about me?

Personal information can be accessed by a restricted number of YTL Communications employees, by certain companies with which YTL Communications may conduct joint programmes, and by third parties with whom YTL Communications contracts to carry out business activities for YTL Communications. We train our employees about the importance of privacy and how to handle and manage customer data appropriately and securely. Also, it is YTL Communicationsâ€™ practice to seek your consent where required by applicable law if you are registering for a programme which is conducted in conjunction with another company that may require access to your personal information.

Does YTL Communications share personal information with third parties?

Except as otherwise stated in this Section, YTL Communications will not transfer your personal information to third parties unless you have been provided with an opportunity to opt-in to this disclosure. YTL Communications may disclose your personal information without your opt-in to third party service providers which assist us with our business activities. YTL Communications further reserves the right to disclose your personal information to respond to authorised information requests from government authorities or when otherwise required by law.

How does YTL Communications secure personal information?

It is YTL Communicationsâ€™ practice to secure each YTL Communications Web Site that collects personal information; however, the confidentiality of personal information transmitted over the Internet cannot be guaranteed. We urge you to exercise caution when transmitting personal information over the Internet. YTL Communications cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will not gain access to your personal information; therefore, when submitting personal information to YTL Communications Web Sites, you must weigh both the benefits and the risks.

How may I correct personal information or delete it from current customer records?

With your support YTL Communications will keep personal information accurate and up-to-date. You may request to amend or correct your personal information. Please notify us of your wishes by contacting us in one of the ways specified below.
