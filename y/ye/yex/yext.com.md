**COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE USE**

We and our service providers use cookies, beacons, embedded scripts and local shared objects in connection with the Sites.

  * **Cookies  **are small text files that are stored on your computer or device when you visit our websites. Cookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or browser. The use of cookies is a standard practice among websites to collect information about visitors’ activities while using the website.
  * **Beacons  **are small graphical images (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) that may be included on our Sites and typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behavior.
  * An  **embedded script  **is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
  * **Local Shared Objects.  **Local shared objects (or Flash cookies) are pieces of data that websites which use Adobe Flash may store on a user’s computer or device. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity use local shared objects. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing local shared objects.

This type of advertising is sometimes called interest-based advertising. Yext adheres to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles when we allow third parties to collect data on the Sites for such advertising. If you do not want to have this information collected and used for interest-based advertising, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/?pid=truste01&aid=preference_manager01&type=public) for partners that participate in the TrustArc opt-out tool (or if located in the European Union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)).  If you wish to opt-out from this type of advertising for companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”), you can do so [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).  Please note that these tools do not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive ads, but they may be less relevant for you.
