### Legal grounds for use of personal information

The principal legal grounds for our use of your personal information are as follows:

  * **Consent** : where you have consented to our use of your information (you will have been presented with a consent form in relation to any such use and may withdraw your consent).
  * **Contract performance** : where we are required to collect and handle your personal information in order to provide you with the services that we have contractually agreed to provide to you, e.g. where you have booked a flight with us or the use of our freight service.  

  * **Legal obligation** : where we need to use your personal information to comply with our legal obligations.  

  * **Vital interests:** where we need to process your personal information in order to protect the vital interests of you or another natural person, e.g. where you require urgent assistance.  

  * **Public interest** : where we need to process your personal information in order to carry out a task that is in the public interest.  

  * **Legitimate interests** : where we use your information to achieve a legitimate interest and our reasons for using it outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights.  




The legal grounds for our use of the sensitive categories of personal information are:

  * **Consent** : where you have explicitly consented to our use of your personal information. You may withdraw your consent to the use of your personal information.
  * **Vital interest** : where we need to process your personal information in order to protect the vital interests of you or another natural person where you or the other person is physically or legally incapable of giving consent.  

  * **Legal claims** : where your personal information is necessary for us to establish, exercise or defend any legal claims.

### Disclosure of information outside the EEA

When we transfer personal information from inside the EEA to outside the EEA, we may be required by law to take specific measures to safeguard the relevant personal information. Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export personal information from the EEA to these jurisdictions. In countries which have not had these approvals, we will use appropriate safeguards to protect any personal information being transferred, such as EU Commission-approved model contractual clauses or binding corporate rules permitted by applicable legal requirements.

Please refer to the section “[Contacting Us](https://web.archive.org/us/en/support/privacy-and-security.html#contacting-us)” if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal information.

### Retention period

Our retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and legal requirements. We retain personal data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. When personal data is no longer needed, we either securely destroy it, or irreversibly anonymise the data (and we may further retain and use the anonymised information).

### Marketing

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. We will inform you if we intend to use your information for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by not opting in when we invite you to participate in our marketing activities. You can also exercise the right by contacting us as set out in the “[Contacting Us](https://web.archive.org/us/en/support/privacy-and-security.html#contacting-us)” section below or by managing your marketing preferences at “My Profile” if your profile is registered on our website.

  * provide you with further details on how we use and process your personal information;
  * delete personal information we no longer have grounds to process; and
  * restrict how we process your personal information while we consider an inquiry you have raised.



In addition, under certain conditions, you have the right to:

  * where processing is based on consent, withdraw the consent;
  * lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
  * object to any processing of personal information that we process on the “legitimate interests” or “public interests” grounds, unless our reasons for the underlying processing outweighs your interests, rights and freedoms; and
