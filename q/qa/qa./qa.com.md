# QA IT Services - Privacy and Security

QA is committed to protecting your privacy. We will only collect, process and store information about you that we have openly collected from you, or with your consent. We will only gather information that is relevant to providing our online services. We may change the content or services found on our Site at any time without notice, and consequently our privacy policy may change at any time in the future. You agree to revisit this page regularly and your continued access to or use of the Site will mean that you agree to the changes.

### How does QA protect customer information?

When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Legislation, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access.

### Personal information

QA only stores information necessary to make a booking. This includes name, address, phone number and email address. Credit/debit card details are also taken at the time of booking for real-time payment. At no time do QA store credit/debit card details.

QA does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

### Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be used to make the web site more usable by storing small pieces of information, such as preferences, or pages the user has visited. QA will occasionally use cookies, but they will never be used to store personal or sensitive information.

Most browsers are set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you may set your browser to disable cookies. For information on how to do this, please consult your Operating Systems manual, or browser help file.
