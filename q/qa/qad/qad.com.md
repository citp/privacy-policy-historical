Privacy Policy

This statement sets forth QAD's Privacy Statement for QAD.com and other QAD websites and describes the practices that QAD will follow with respect to the privacy of users of this site.

### What is personally identifiable information?

"Personally identifiable information" is information about you, such as name, address, e-mail address, user ID, mailing address, and so on.

### What is the scope of the QAD network?

As a global company, QAD operates a number of Web sites around the world. Any information that you submit to one of our sites in any one country or language may be sent electronically to a server for one of these sites. As such, the information may be used, stored, or processed outside the country where it was recorded.

### How is information collected, used, and disclosed?

We do not collect personally identifiable information — including your e-mail address — unless we first ask you for it. On some of our sites, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with information, including your e-mail address, street address, telephone number or other information so that we may enhance your site visit or follow up with you after your visit. Whether you provide any information is entirely up to you. If you have voluntarily provided information, you consented to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Statement. In some circumstances, QAD may share information you voluntarily provide us with authorized business partners. QAD makes available a communication and collaboration tool to users of the QAD websites; you acknowledge and agree that other users of the QAD website may have access to your personally identifiable information (e.g. because it has been added to an address book). We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information collected through this site to anyone. You hereby agree that you will not use any personally identified information available on a QAD website for any purposes other than the purpose for which it is made available on the website.

During the period you are logged onto our site we log IP addresses, browser and platform types, domain names, access times, referral addresses, and your activity while using or reviewing our site. QAD may also disclose information in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) enforce the Web site Terms and Conditions of Use; or (d) act to protect the interests of our users or others.

### What are cookies and how are they used?

Some QAD sites, like many other commercial web sites, may utilize a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a web site operator determine that a particular user had visited the site previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. Cookies are small strings of text that web sites can send to your browser. Cookies cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or obtain your e-mail address. If you are simply browsing a QAD informational site, a cookie may be used to identify your browser as one that has visited the site before.

We may also make use of memory-based cookies in support of authenticating the user of certain QAD web applications. Similarly, if you are a registered user of a site providing service to QAD clients (and have a user ID and password), we may use cookies so that we can provide personalized information based on preferences you have indicated while using the site. Although you have the ability to modify your browser to either accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize QAD services which require registration if you reject cookies. We do not follow your browsing path outside of the QAD site, except for referral data discussed above. Advertising networks that serve ads onto our web site may also use their own cookies. We have no access or control over these cookies.

### What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information?

If, in connection with your use of a particular service, we ask to use your data in a way not described in this Privacy Statement and you do not wish to permit that use, you can choose not to use the particular service.

If you have voluntarily provided personally identifiable information, we may, from time to time, send you mail or e-mail regarding products and services.

### How can you correct, access, and update your information?

You may view and edit your personally identifiable information at any time by contacting us using the link provided on the web site.

### How do we protect your information?

We use reasonable commercial efforts to protect your personally identifiable information. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our servers. Internally, we will restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees and authorized business partners who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees and authorized business partners are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy policies. We will review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the changes on this page so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and when and how we will disclose it.

### How can you help protect your information?

If you are using a QAD web site for which you registered and chose a password, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also remember to sign out of the registered site by closing your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personally identifiable information and correspondence if others have access to your computer.

### What about links to other sites?

QAD sites may contain links to other sites, including those of our authorized business partners. While we seek to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites.
