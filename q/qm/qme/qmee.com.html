<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>
This privacy policy (together with our

and any other documents referred to within) governs the collection, storage and use of
personal information collected by us, Qmee Ltd, in providing our service, including our
website at www.qmee.com and our qmee browser application software (which is available
for download via the website). It provides you with details about the personal information
we collect from you, how we use your personal information and your rights to control
personal information we hold about you.
</p>
<p>
Please read this privacy policy carefully – by accessing or browsing this website, you
confirm that you have read, understood and agree to this privacy policy in its entirety.
If you do not agree to this privacy policy in its entirety, you must not use our service,
including this website and any software available for download on the website.
</p>
<p>
This privacy policy was last updated on 19 April 2012. Please check back regularly to keep
informed of updates to this privacy policy.
</p>
<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>
Qmee Ltd is a company registered in England and Wales (registration number 07455925), whose
registered office is at 3 Wesley Gate, Queens Road, Reading, Berkshire, RG1 4AP.
</p>
<p>
We respect your right to privacy and will only process personal information you provide to
us in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, the Privacy and Electronic Communications
(EC Directive) Regulations 2003 and other applicable privacy laws.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about how we collect, store and use personal information, or if you
have any other privacy-related questions, please e-mail us at
<a href="mailto:support@qmee.com" title="support@qmee.com">support@qmee.com.</a>
</p>
<h2>The personal information we collect about you</h2>
<p>
In order for you to use our service, we will need to collect the following personal information from you:
</p><ul>
<li>
your e-mail address;
</li>
<li>
your country of residence;
</li>
<li>
your Paypal account details;
</li>
<li>
your search history and details of sponsored links that you click on when using our service; and
</li>
<li>
details of your behaviour on the sites linked to by our service, namely the pages you browse and for
how long you browse those pages.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
You may voluntarily submit the following additional personal information:
</p><ul>
<li>
your name;
</li>
<li>
your age and sex;
</li>
<li>
your town of residence; and
</li>
<li>
your postal address, phone and fax details.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>How we may store and use your information</h2>
<p>
We (or third party data processors acting on our behalf) may collect, store and use your personal information
listed above for the following purposes:
</p><ul>
<li>
to make our service, including this website, available to you and to provide you with content which is
tailored to your individual tastes;
</li>
<li>
to provide you with sponsored search results which we think may interest you via our software;
</li>
<li>
to make payments to you or to third parties on your instructions via this website;
</li>
<li>
to assess whether you are abusing our service contrary to our
<a href="terms_of_service" title="terms and conditions">terms and conditions;</a>
</li>
<li>
to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us;
</li>
<li>
to notify you about changes to our service;
</li>
<li>
where you have given us your consent, to contact you (including by SMS and e-mail) with products
and services which we think may interest you; and
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
We will not disclose, sell or rent your personal information to any third party unless you have consented
to this. If you do consent but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity.
</p>
<p>
However, if a third party acquires all (or substantially all) of our business and/or assets, we may disclose
your personal information to that third party in connection with the acquisition. We may also disclose your
personal information where we are required to do so by applicable law, by a governmental body or by a
law enforcement agency.
</p>
<p>
We may also collect anonymised details about users of our service, including visitors to our website and
users of our software, for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. However, no single
individual will be identifiable from the anonymised details we collect for these purposes.
</p>
<p>
We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them
with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30
have clicked on their sponsored link on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to
help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1 or a US ZIP code). We may make
use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes
by displaying their sponsored links to that target audience.
</p>
<h2>International transfers</h2>
<p>
We may transfer personal information that we collect from you to third party data processors located in
countries that are outside of the European Economic Area (including to United States) in connection with
the above purposes. Please be aware that countries which are outside the European Economic Area may not
offer the same level of data protection as the United Kingdom, although our collection, storage and use
of your personal data will continue to be governed by this privacy policy.
</p>
