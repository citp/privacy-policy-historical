  * your e-mail address; 
  * your country of residence; 
  * your Paypal account details; 
  * your search history and details of sponsored links that you click on when using our service; and

## How we may store and use your information

We (or third party data processors acting on our behalf) may collect, store and use your personal information listed above for the following purposes: 

  * to make our service, including this website, available to you and to provide you with content which is tailored to your individual tastes; 
  * to provide you with sponsored search results which we think may interest you via our software; 
  * to make payments to you or to third parties on your instructions via this website; 
  * to assess whether you are abusing our service contrary to our [terms and conditions;](https://web.archive.org/web/20150321194137id_/https%3A//www.qmee.com/terms_of_service "terms and conditions")
  * to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us; 
  * to notify you about changes to our service; 
  * where you have given us your consent, to contact you (including by SMS and e-mail) with products and services which we think may interest you; and 



We will not disclose, sell or rent your personal information to any third party unless you have consented to this. If you do consent but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity. 

However, if a third party acquires all (or substantially all) of our business and/or assets, we may disclose your personal information to that third party in connection with the acquisition. We may also disclose your personal information where we are required to do so by applicable law, by a governmental body or by a law enforcement agency. 

We may also collect anonymised details about users of our service, including visitors to our website and users of our software, for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. However, no single individual will be identifiable from the anonymised details we collect for these purposes. 

We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their sponsored link on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1 or a US ZIP code). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their sponsored links to that target audience. 

## International transfers

We may transfer personal information that we collect from you to third party data processors located in countries that are outside of the European Economic Area (including to United States) in connection with the above purposes. Please be aware that countries which are outside the European Economic Area may not offer the same level of data protection as the United Kingdom, although our collection, storage and use of your personal data will continue to be governed by this privacy policy.
