      <b>        
      <p>1. In General</p>        
      </b>        
      <p>QFX Software's privacy policy covers the collection and use of the         
      personally identifying information that we ask you to provide when you         
      purchase our products or services or interact with our sales or support         
      associates. "Personally identifying information" is information         
      that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address, and         
      email address. Your privacy is an important issue at QFX Software, and we         
      design and operate our services and products with the protection of your         
      privacy in mind. Please take a few minutes to learn more about our privacy         
      principles and practices, including what type of personal information we         
      collect and why we collect it, and what measures we take to safeguard it.</p>        
      <b>        
      <p>2. What information we collect and for what purpose</p>        
      </b>        
      <p>We ask for your personal information when you're signing up for QFX         
      services, purchasing a QFX product, downloading a software update, or         
      requesting support to a service or product. At such times, your personal         
      information is required to identify you as a valid customer.&nbsp;</p>        
      <p>Some of our services and products may also require that you register or         
      be registered for your online accounts with your bank(s) and credit card         
      companies, which may ask you for some personal information in order to         
      create an account (typically your name, email address and a password for         
      your account). We collect only your name, address, and email address to         
      identify your account and for providing technical support. The rest of the         
      information is saved on your personal computer but is NOT collected by us.         
      All of your personal information may also be saved on the online servers         
      of your bank(s) and credit card companies. Please see their privacy policy         
      statements for information on how these entities handle your personal         
      information.</p>        
      <b>        
      <p>3. How we safeguard the information we collect</p>        
      </b>        
      <p>Security is a major priority at QFX software, and we take great care to         
      protect your personal information. Any personally identifying information         
      you provide to us is protected by encryption and is not available to         
      anyone else through us.</p>        
      <p>We do NOT rent or sell your personally identifying information to other         
      companies or individuals.</p>        
      <p>Data generated by your use of Monesafe and Monechron are stored only on         
      your computer and are encrypted by our software.</p>
