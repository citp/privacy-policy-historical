Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

**Rights concerning the processing of your personal information**

**Right to restrict processing of personal information**

In some situations, you have the right to require us to restrict the processing of your personal information. We may restrict your personal information by temporarily moving the information to another processing system, making the information unavailable to users, or temporarily removing published information from a website. We may also use technical methods to ensure the personal information is not subject to further processing and cannot be changed. When we have restricted processing of personal information, this will be clearly indicated on our systems.

You can require us to restrict processing in the following circumstances:

  1. You are concerned that the information we hold about you is inaccurate. You can ask us to restrict the information until we are able to determine whether the information is accurate or inaccurate;
  2. We are processing your personal data unlawfully and you do not want us to delete the information but restrict it instead.
  3. We no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collected it, but they are needed by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
  4. You have objected to the processing (see below), and we need to decide whether the legitimate grounds we have to process the information override your legitimate interests.



**Processing you think is unlawful**

If you tell us that you think we are processing your personal information unlawfully, but you do not want the information to be erased, you have the right to require us to restrict the processing of that information.

We will ask you for an explanation about why you think the processing is unlawful, and may also ask that you provide evidence to support this view.

**Processing of personal information you think is inaccurate**

You can tell us if you think the personal information we are processing about you is factually inaccurate.

If we find that personal information we are processing about you is inaccurate, we will take appropriate steps to correct the information.

**Right to erasure of personal data (“the right to be forgotten”)**

In the following circumstances, you have the right to require that QS securely deletes or destroys your personal information:

  * If the personal information we hold about you is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we originally collected it.
  * The processing is based on consent – if you have previously given your consent to QS collecting and processing your personal information, and you notify us that you withdraw your consent.
  * If you think QS has processed your personal information unlawfully.



If you think any of the above situations apply, we may ask you for an explanation and further information to verify this.

**Right to object to processing**

You have the right to object to QS processing your personal data in the following circumstances:

**Personal information used for direct marketing**

If we are using your personal information to send you direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time. If you exercise this right, we will stop processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. However, we may keep your information on a “suppression list” to ensure your information is not added to any marketing lists at some point in the future.

**Right to data portability**

If you have provided your information to QS, you have the right to request and receive a copy of that information in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format.

There are some situations in which the right to data portability does not apply. For further information, please contact: dpo@qs.com

**Exercising your rights concerning the processing of your personal information**

**Your right to complain to a national data protection regulator (data protection supervisory authority)**

If you think we have processed your personal information unfairly or unlawfully, or we have not complied with your rights under GDPR, you have the right to complain to a national data protection regulator.

Complaints about how we process your personal information can be considered by the UK data protection regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The ICO can be contacted using the following details:

Information Commissioner’s Office

Wycliffe House

Water Lane

Wilmslow

Cheshire

SK9 5AF

UNITED KINGDOM

Website:  ** _www.ico.org.uk.  _**

Email: [ **casework@ico.org.uk**](mailto:casework@ico.org.uk).

If you live in a country or territory located in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA), and you think that some, or all, of the issues you are concerned about have taken place in your country of residence, you can complain to your national data protection regulator. For contact details of national data protection regulators in the EU and EEA, please use the following link:

[**http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en….**](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm%C2%A0)

You should be aware that from 25 May 2018 onwards, the EU or EEA regulator you first contact may not be the regulator that deals with your complaint. They may refer your complaint to another data protection regulator, and a number of regulators may work together to determine the outcome of your complaint. The overall handling of your complaint will be dealt with by a “lead supervisory authority”, which will be allocated during the complaint handling process.

If you live outside the EU or EEA, and the data protection issue you are concerned about relates to the processing of personal data in the country you live in, you may be able to complain to your national data protection or privacy regulator. Details of some national data protection or privacy regulators are detailed in the above link. Alternatively, you may be able to find details of your national privacy or data protection regulator by searching the internet.

If you have a concern about how we have processed your personal data, many data protection/privacy regulators will ask that you contact us first, outlining your concerns, allowing us to try and put the issue right, prior to contacting them with your complaint or concern.
