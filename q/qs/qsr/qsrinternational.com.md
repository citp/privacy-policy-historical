# Privacy Policy | QSR International

  
By using this site, you acknowledge that you have reviewed the terms of this QSR Global Data Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) and agree that we may collect, use, process and transfer your personal data in accordance with this Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you may choose not to provide any personal data and not to use our site.  However, you may then not be able to use our products or services. This Privacy Policy also forms part of the Terms and Conditions for ordering and purchasing QSR’s products and services.  
 

### Who are we?

QSR International Pty Ltd A.C.N. 006 357 213 (“QSR International”) is a global organization. QSR International’s Head Office is located in Australia, with offices in the UK, US, and Japan.  
The related entities of QSR International include the following: 

  * QSR International (UK) Limited – United Kingdom
  * QSR International (Americas) Inc. – U.S.A.
  * QSR International Japan K.K. – Japan



For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, QSR International and its related entities will collectively be known as “QSR”. As part of the business operations of QSR, all the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by the various entities within the QSR group of companies and by QSR’s offices around the world in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.

QSR is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers’ personal data and the responsible use of such information in accordance with the relevant laws which relate to data privacy and handling of such information. We have developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, store, use, process and disclose your personal data used online and across regions. 

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully for a clear understanding of how we collect, use and handle your personal data on our website.

From time to time we may make changes to the QSR Global Data Privacy Policy in accordance with legislative changes and business requirements.  The most current version of the QSR Global Data Privacy Policy will be posted on the QSR website.  In this Privacy Policy, “we”, “our” and “us” refers to QSR International and its related entities; and “you”, “your” and “yours” refers to our customers and third parties, excluding employees of QSR.

Consent needs to be free and informed.  You must ensure you understand the purpose for the collection.

In addition to QSR’s safeguards as contained in this Privacy Policy, the relevant laws protect your personal data. 

  * **Australia** \- The Australian Privacy Principles (“APPs”) are contained in schedule 1 of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). QSR International is considered to be an APP entity under the Australian Privacy Act and must comply with the Australian Privacy Act as to how to handle, use and manage personal information (as defined in the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)).
  * **UK** \- Your personal data is protected in the UK by the Data Protection Act 1998 which requires data controllers to ensure that your personal data is processed lawfully and fairly. The EU Directive 2016/679 for the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) came into force on 24 May 2016 and will apply from 25 May 2018. The GDPR intends to unify data protection laws within the EU and the export of personal data of EU residents outside the EU. It is likely that the GDPR will be implemented by the UK despite Brexit.
  * **U.S.** \- Data privacy is not currently highly regulated in the U.S. Although partial regulations exist, there is no all-encompassing law regulating the acquisition, storage, or use of personal data in the U.S. With the exception of California, very few states recognize an individual's right to privacy. The U.S. believes in self-regulation of data protection by companies.
  * **Japan** – The Act on the Protection of Personal Information 2003 (“APPI”) handles the protection of personal data in Japan.



This Privacy Policy sets out how we protect an individual’s personal data and provides information on: 

  1. the general categories of personal data we collect;
  2. why we collect an individual's personal data;
  3. how it will be used, and who it will be disclosed to; 
  4. the legal basis of our processing that personal data; and
  5. your rights in relation to the personal data we collect.

 

### What Type of Data is Collected?

QSR will collect, store, use, process and disclose personal data in the manner permitted by law.

###   
Retaining your Personal Data

We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.  In most cases it may not be possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained.  In such cases, we will determine the period of retention based on the period required by applicable law.

QSR will destroy or de-identify your personal data if it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it could be used or disclosed in terms of applicable law. 

###   
Types of Data not Collected by QSR 

QSR does not collect any details of the data you are working with when you use our software products. This data is stored only in the projects or files into which you direct the software to save the data.  
NCapture stores the data you capture only in the files you create. When using NCapture to capture data from social media sites, you may be asked by the site whether you wish to grant NCapture permission to collect particular kinds of data. 

Choosing to grant these permissions to NCapture:  
(a)    Does not allow NCapture to capture any data that you, as a user of that social media site, do not yourself have access to.  
(b)    Does not cause NCapture to send any captured data to QSR.

When you import data captured using NCapture into NVivo, you have the option to exclude some unwanted information (such as location or bio). Refer to the Help documentation in NCapture and NVivo for further details. 

###   
Third Parties to whom QSR may Disclose your Personal Data

In providing the products and services to you, and insofar as reasonably necessary for those purposes, QSR may need to disclose your personal data to third parties including: 

  * QSR’s suppliers, subcontractors, agents, solicitors, professional advisers, government regulatory bodies, tribunals, courts of law, debt collection agents, insurers and to their respective related entities.
  * Third parties engaged by QSR (who will be bound by confidentiality obligations) in your geographic region or able to communicate in your language, to ensure that you are better serviced. 
  * Third parties engaged by QSR to conduct customer satisfaction surveys (only with your prior consent). 
  * A third party event management platform such as Eventbrite to register QSR hosted events, workshops, eWorkshops and webinars.  Eventbrite has its own privacy policy and may be a data controller in its own right in relation to the personal data we disclose to Eventbrite.
  * In the event of a re-organization, merger, or sale we may transfer your personal data to a third party (who will be bound by confidentiality obligations) during the due diligence process.
  * Payment services providers in relation to financial transactions relating to our services, including processing payments.
  * In relation to disclosure necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to QSR, we may also disclose your personal data in circumstances where necessary in legal proceedings, whether in or out of court.



Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, QSR will not disclose your personal data to a third party unless the disclosure is required or authorized by law, in an emergency or in the event of an investigation of suspected criminal activity such as fraud. 

###   
How does QSR keep your Personal Data Secure?

QSR has implemented security measures to protect personal data received from you. The following security measures are in place: 

  * QSR uses malware scanning.  QSR’s website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to QSR’s website as safe as possible.
  * Your personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons duly authorized by QSR, and required to keep the information confidential.
  * If you make an online application or undertake a payment transaction using QSR’s website, QSR takes additional steps to protect the security of your personal data. Your personal data is encrypted via a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology (in your web browser, you can confirm that your session is encrypted by the appearance of a locked padlock symbol at the foot of the browser).
  * All payment transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.



Notwithstanding the security measures implemented by QSR, you should be aware that there are risks in transmitting information across the internet. While QSR takes measures to protect your personal data, we cannot warrant the security of any information transmitted to QSR online and users of our website do so at their own risk. QSR will remove your personal data from its system where it is no longer required unless QSR is required by law to store your personal data. 

###   
International Transfers of Personal Data

In certain circumstances we may need to transfer your personal data to countries outside the country in which the data was collected (or, in the case of personal data collected within the European Economic Area (“EEA”), to countries outside the EEA) including our offices around the world (currently located in Australia, USA and Japan). International transfers of your personal data will be protected by the appropriate safeguards, namely the standard data protection model clauses adopted by the European Commission or a supervisory authority, which we will incorporate into our agreements with such transferees of personal data.  You can find a copy of model contract clauses for transferring personal data outside the EEA at: <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en>.

As a customer or website user of QSR, you give your consent to QSR to transfer or grant access to your personal data between the companies in the QSR group. All data is transferred or accessed using either a secure transport layer or encrypted algorithm. A majority of the data collected is then centralized and imported into a central customer relationship management system, and housed within secure data centre facilities. This is available to staff across all regions within the QSR group by way of an encrypted secure transport layer and individual staff authentication is required. 

###   
Cloud Storage of Personal Data

We may store data on remote servers operated by a cloud service provider to QSR rather than storing it on our own servers. Regardless of where you use our online services or provide information to us, the information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located outside the country in which the data was collected (or, in the case of personal data collected within the EEA, to countries outside the EEA).  By providing any data through the online services, you hereby expressly consent to such transferring and processing of your data in such third countries.

Transfers of personal data to servers operated by cloud service providers outside the EEA will be protected by the appropriate safeguards, namely the standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or a supervisory authority, which we will incorporate into our agreements with such cloud service providers.  You can find a copy of model contract clauses for transferring personal data outside the EEA at: <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en>.

All data is stored with secure methods and with limited/restricted access to persons authorized by QSR. Data from the various collection points with the QSR group are stored in Australia, USA, Singapore and Ireland.
