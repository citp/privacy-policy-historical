In the event available, you may choose to link your account to your social media accounts, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and/or Google+. In case you link your account to these social media accounts, Q-dance collects general information, such as your name, email address, location and skills from your social media profile.

For the use of social media and third party services you are bound by the conditions for use of these services. Q-dance cannot influence such third parties and thus cannot guarantee that these third party services use your personal data in accordance with the applicable privacy law- and regulations.

Automatically generated data

Q-dance requires certain information in order for the Website to work as optimally as possible (for example, to display content correctly and to keep the Website secure). That is why Q-dance automatically collects generated data about your use of the Website. This information consists of:

  * your IP address (an unique number, which makes it possible to recognize your device);
  * account activity (including storage usage, number of log-ins);
  * data displayed or clicked on (including UI elements, links); and
  * other log information (including browser type, IP address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and referrer URL).


  3. **For what purposes will Q-dance use information about you?**



Q-dance may use your personal information for the following purposes:

  * Q-dance will use your email address for creating your personal account. We may also use your email address to send information regarding your account and registration, for example in order to help you to restore your forgotten password, and to login into the Website.
  * Q-dance may use your email address to send emails, such as notifications and information regarding offers of Q-dance. You may at all times opt out of receiving such emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email or by sending an e-mail to info@q-dance.com.
  * Your personal information will be used within the Website to provide the services, products and/or information offered by Q-dance.
  * Your personal information will be used to build a profile pertaining specifically to you. This allows Q-dance to offer you services and advertisements that are specifically tailored to your interests.
  * Your email address, username, first and last name will be used when purchasing products and/or services via the Website.
  * Your personal information will be used to configure the Website to your wishes and needs and to improve the quality of the Website, from functionality to design. Your personal information will also be used to generate statistical data on your use of the Website.



Other than with your consent we will not provide your personal data to third parties for commercial purposes. 

For providing the Website to you, Q-dance can make use of third parties. Q-dance entered into agreements with those third parties, in which parties have agreed upon the technical and organizational measures those third parties must take to protect your (personal) information. 

Q-dance may also provide your personal information to third parties if the information cannot in any way be traced to you (for instance automatically generated information, not being an IP-address). Also, Q-dance may provide your personal information to third parties if Q-dance is allowed to do so on account of national or international laws, case law and/or regulations or if Q-dance considers it necessary for the protection of its own rights.

  4. **What are cookies and how does Q-dance use them?**



When using the Website, various cookies are saved on your computer, mobile device and/or tablet (“Devices”), which can then be accessed. Cookies are small pieces of information (in the form of text) that a server sends to the browser (such as Google Chrome or Firefox) with the intention that the browser sends this information back to the server the next time a user makes use of the Website. Cookies of Q-dance cannot damage your Devices or the files saved on it. 

[You can read more information about the cookies that Q-dance uses in the Cookie Statement](https://web.archive.org/global/cookie-statement/).

  5. **Hyperlinks**



The Website may contain hyperlinks which take you away from the Website and take you to the website or application of a third party. Q-dance has no authority over the services and/or websites of third parties to which it is linked. It therefore may be the case that for the use of those services and/or websites of third parties another privacy statement is applicable. This Privacy Statement is exclusively applicable to the personal data that are obtained through the Website. Q-dance does not accept any responsibility or liability for the (use and/or content of the) services and/or websites of third parties.

  6. **How does Q-dance protect your personal information and where is the data stored?**



Q-dance takes appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your (personal) information against loss or any form of unlawful use. Q-dance will not store your personal data for any longer than is legally permissible or necessary for the abovementioned purposes.

If you wish to correct, add, remove or screen your personal data, you may send another request thereto. Q-dance shall respond within 4 weeks to such a request. If Q-dance decides to deny your request, it shall inform you on the grounds of this decision.

  8. **Can this Privacy Statement be changed?**
