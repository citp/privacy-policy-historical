# Privacy Policy

Gitorious AS (“Gitorious”) opererates several websites including Gitorious.org, Gitorious.com, Gitorious.net. It is Gitorious' policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites. The following privacy policy apply only to the websites above, for the privacy policies of other Gitorious services please consult the individual privacy policies of those other services.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Gitorious collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Gitorious’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Gitorious' visitors use its website. From time to time, Gitorious may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Gitorious also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and e-mail addresses. Gitorious does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

You hereby agree to the registration and use of information described above.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Gitorious' websites choose to interact with Gitorious in ways that require Gitorious to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Gitorious gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Gitorious.org to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Gitorious – by purchasing additional hosting services, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Gitorious collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Gitorious. Gitorious does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

You hereby agree to the registration and use of information described above.

Gitorious may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Gitorious may monitor the most popular repositories on the Gitorious.org site or track usage of Git repositories hosted in Gitorious.org.
