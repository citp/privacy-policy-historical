      <p>Where practicable, we will give you the  option of interacting with us anonymously or using a pseudonym. For instance,  you do not need to provide any personal information in order to visit the QTAC  website and use facilities such as Course Search, nor will you usually be asked  to identify yourself if you contact QTAC by telephone with a general enquiry  about our services.</p>
<p>We collect the personal information necessary for us to provide you with the services you have requested&nbsp;from us, and to manage your QTAC application. You do not have to provide us with&nbsp;your personal information, but if you do not do so we may not be able to provide you with some or all of our services.</p>
<p>By disclosing personal information to QTAC, you are consenting to its collection by QTAC. If QTAC receives unsolicited personal information about you which it reasonably believes that  you have voluntarily disclosed (for instance, if you are listed as the sender on mail containing personal information), this personal information may be included&nbsp;in your QTAC application. This may include personal or sensitive information that QTAC could not have solicited&nbsp;from you. QTAC may choose to destroy unsolicited personal information about you that&nbsp;is not relevant to QTAC's functions. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The personal information that you are currently required to provide to lodge a QTAC application includes:</p>
      <ul style="margin-top: 0;">

<h2><span class="style3"><a name="howwediscloseinfo" id="howwediscloseinfo"></a>How we&nbsp;disclose your information</span></h2>
<p>Where appropriate we may disclose your personal information to  third parties as required to process your QTAC application or to provide you  with other services. The way in which these third parties use your personal information is governed by QTAC's <a href="PrivacyPolicy-Corporate.html">Privacy Policy - Corporate. </a></p>
<p><span style="color:#666666;">In  addition, by providing the details of an authorised person to QTAC, you are  consenting to the disclosure of your personal information to your authorised person. </span> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Your  personal information may be disclosed to third parties including:</p>

<p>On occasion QTAC may disclose  your personal information to entities located overseas in order to process your  QTAC application or to provide you with other services. You acknowledge that, by agreeing to the disclosure of your information to  these entities outside of Australia, QTAC will no longer be required to take  reasonable steps to ensure the overseas recipient's compliance with the  Australian privacy law in relation to your information and we will not be  liable to you for any breach of the Australian privacy law by these overseas  recipients and, on this basis, you consent to such disclosure.</p>
<p>We will only disclose your sensitive information for the purposes  for which it was initially collected, other directly related purposes, purposes  to which you consent, and as otherwise permitted or required by law<span class="style3">.</span></p>
<h2><span class="style3"><a name="importantnoticedoc" id="importantnoticedoc"></a>Important notice in relation to fraudulent documentation</span></h2>
<p>The <em>Privacy Act 1988 </em>(Cth) authorises QTAC to use and disclose your personal information without following  the provisions in this Privacy Policy where QTAC has reason to suspect that you  have engaged in serious misconduct in relation to QTAC’s functions, if the use  or disclosure of the personal information is necessary in order for QTAC to  take appropriate action in relation to the misconduct. </p>
<p>QTAC considers the provision of fraudulent documentation to be  serious misconduct in relation to QTAC’s functions. Therefore, if QTAC has  reason to suspect that you have presented fraudulent documentation of any kind,  QTAC may use or disclose your personal information in a manner inconsistent  with this Privacy Policy to the extent required to undertake an investigation  into that documentation and to take appropriate action in light of the outcome  of the investigation. </p>
<h2><span class="style3"><a name="securityofinfo" id="securityofinfo"></a>Security of your information</span></h2>
<p>We will take reasonable steps (including any measures required by  law) to ensure your information is protected and secure. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">For any payments you make via our websites, over the telephone or  face to face, we use a recognised payment service provider that is required to  take reasonable steps to protect your information. We also take reasonable  precautions to ensure that any information you provide to us through our  websites is transferred securely from our servers to our mainframe computers. <br>
  <br>
  However, no data protection and security measures are completely secure.  Despite all the measures we have put in place, we cannot guarantee the security  of your information, particularly in relation to transmissions over the  internet. Accordingly, any information which you transmit to us is transmitted  at your own risk. You must take care to ensure you protect your information  (for example, by protecting your QTAC user names and passwords) and you should  notify us as soon as possible after you become aware of any security breaches.</p>
