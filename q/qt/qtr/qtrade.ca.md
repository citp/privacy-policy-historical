# Qtrade Financial Group - Privacy Policy

At the Qtrade Financial Group (comprised of Qtrade Investor, Qtrade Advisor, Qtrade Institutional Services, Qtrade Securities, Qtrade Asset Management, Qtrade Insurance Solutions, Qtrade Fund Management and OceanRock Capital Partners), we understand that the privacy and security of your personal and account information are important to you. The Qtrade Financial Group maintains confidentiality standards that are designed to protect your personal information. As regulated entities, the companies within the Qtrade Financial Group are required to obtain your personal and financial information and hold such information on a confidential basis.

When you browse the public portions of the Qtrade Financial Group website (www.qtrade.ca), your account and/or personal information cannot be retrieved from our systems.

If, however, you choose to access the trading, research or portfolio areas (which are designed only for account holders), you are required to provide both your user ID and individually selected password, which only you know. Never share your account number or password with anyone. Also, your password should be changed frequently. In order to protect against the loss, theft, misuse or compromise of your confidential Qtrade data, you acknowledge and agree that you have reviewed and are complying with your "Customer Responsibilities" as set out in the following link to "[Internet Security](https://web.archive.org/en/security/internetsecurity.jsp)".

Our employee access to customer information is limited to staff that require the relevant information to properly service your account. Our employees are continuously educated on the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of customer information. When we collect information about you, we will explain how we intend to use it. We limit the information collected to what we need for those purposes, and use it only for those purposes. 

We will give you access to the information we retain about you, and make every reasonable effort to keep your information accurate and up-to-date. You can help by keeping us informed of any changes, such as a new address or telephone number. If you find any errors in our information about you, let us know and, if incorrect, we will correct it. If you require information, simply contact us with specific details of your query. We will advise you in advance if a charge will be required for conducting the search, and we will respond to your request within 30 days. 

We may exchange credit information about you with other lenders or credit bureaus for verification purposes, and to assess your eligibility for credit. We will not do this without your consent, but please remember that if you do not give your consent we may not be able to open an account for you or extend credit to you. Once we have extended credit to you, you may not withdraw your consent for us to share your credit record with other lenders and credit bureaus, as this is necessary to support the credit approval process. 

With your permission, we may share certain information regarding your account with your referring financial institution (if any) and its subsidiaries and affiliates - this permission may be withdrawn at any time. 

Any personal and account data maintained by us is done to fulfill our legal and regulatory requirements and to provide you with the products and services you request. Save for these exceptions, we will not share, sell or distribute your personal or account information to any outside source. 

Usually, you can refuse your consent to share information, or withdraw it at any time, by contacting us in writing. We will explain your options and any consequences of refusing or withdrawing your consent, and record your choices. If you don't want us to share information with your referring financial institution, you can tell us at any time. 

Regardless of your preferred trading method - web or via a Qtrade Investment Representative -- all orders flow through our advanced trading system. Communications with us are secure. The Qtrade Financial Group utilizes state-of-the-art Internet security. 

We will release your information when required or permitted by law. We must give information in response to a valid demand, search warrant or other legally valid enquiry or order. We may disclose information to help collect debts owed to us by you. We may also disclose information to an investigative body in the case of a breach of agreement or contravention of law - this helps prevent fraud, money laundering or other criminal activity. 

For regulatory purposes, self regulatory organizations (including Market Regulation Services Inc., the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada, the Mutual Fund Dealers Association, the provincial securities commissions, Bourse de Montreal Inc., and the Canadian Investor Protection Fund - collectively, 'SROs') require access to personal information of current and former clients, employees, agents, directors, officers and others that has been collected or used by the Qtrade Financial Group. SROs collect, use or disclose such personal information obtained from Qtrade Financial Group entities for regulatory purposes, including: 

  * Surveillance of trading-related activity; 
  * Sales, financial compliance, trade desk review and other regulatory audits; 
  * Investigation of potential regulatory and statutory violations; 
  * Regulatory databases; 
  * Enforcement or disciplinary proceedings; 
  * Reporting to securities regulators; and 
  * Information-sharing with securities regulatory authorities, regulated marketplaces, other SROs and law enforcement agencies in any jurisdiction in connection with any of the foregoing. 



If you are concerned about our treatment of your personal information, please contact us at 1.877.QTRADE-0, or by mail at Suite 1920, One Bentall Centre, 505 Burrard Street, Box 85, Vancouver, BC V7X 1M6. If, after we have attempted to resolve your concern you are still not satisfied, please consult the applicable privacy commissioner in your province.
