Your privacy and security are important to QuestBridge, a division of The Quest Scholars Program ("QB", "us", "our" or "we"). Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions relating to the collection, use and possible disclosure of that information. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to your use of the www.questbridge.org website (the "QB Website"), which is owned and operated on behalf of The Quest Scholars Program. Questions regarding this privacy policy should be directed to [questions@questbridge.org](mailto:questions@questbridge.org). Please note that QB will not knowingly accept information from individuals who are under 13 years of age without first obtaining verifiable parental consent.

### 1\. What Information We Collect from You

### Information You Provide to Us

Most of the personally identifiable information that we receive about you ("Personal Information") comes either directly to us from you or indirectly to us through our service providers. Typically, this information includes your name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. We may also collect other types of Personal Information when you are applying for a specific service or program including, but not limited to, the College Match Program or College Prep Scholarship Program, which are described further under "Registration" below. We collect Personal Information when you register or apply with us or our service providers, log on, or visit the QB Website, including when you participate in programs, services and activities on the QB Website, such as the College Match or College Prep Scholarship Programs.

### Registration

In order to access certain portions of the QB Website and to use certain services provided therein, QB may require you to register either directly with QB or through one of its service providers. These services include, but are not limited to, our National College Match program which offers you an opportunity to be matched with one of our partner colleges or universities for early admission and a full scholarship (the "College Match Program"), and our College Prep Scholarship program for high school juniors (the "CPS Program"). In order to participate in either our College Match or CPS Program, you must first register and create an online account with QB through our application site. To create an account, you will be asked to create a username and password and to provide information such as your name, address, phone number and e-mail address on the registration form. In addition to the uses set forth in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information may also be used to contact you when necessary for customer service reasons. Once registered with the QB Website, you will then be able to complete the application process. For more detailed information on what information will be collected during the application process, please refer to the "How to Apply" sections of the QB Website. All Personal Information collected by the QB Website, including without limitation the registration and application information, will be available to QB and subject to this Privacy Policy.

Your use of the QB Website is conditioned on your provision of requested information in an accurate and truthful fashion. If you choose not to provide such information, you may not be able to access, apply for or utilize the College Match Program, the CPS Program, or other services and/or opportunities provided on the QB Website. You may cancel your account at any time by contacting [questions@questbridge.org](mailto:questions@questbridge.org). Once QB has finished processing your cancellation request, your account will be deactivated.

### Information Collected Through Technology

**Cookies**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Generally, cookies work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of our site. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information; we use them to provide features such as personalization, to save your username and to keep track of your application. We may also use cookies to assist us in delivering content specific to your interests, such as informing you of certain third party offerings. Additionally, after you have entered your username and password during a session on the QB Website, that information is saved so you do not have to re-enter it repeatedly during that session. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the QB Website unavailable to you.

**IP Address**

You can visit many areas of the QB Website anonymously without the need to become a registered user. Even in such cases, we may collect IP addresses automatically. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin service with an Internet Service Provider. Each time you access the QB Website and each time you request one of our pages, our server logs your IP address. Standing alone, your IP address is not necessarily personally identifiable. We may use your IP address to administer our website, to assist in diagnosing problems with our server, to monitor our system performance and/or to make it easier and more convenient for you to navigate and use the QB Website.

**Web Beacons**

QB may use a variety of other technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in web pages and e-mails. We use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our users to determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.

**Information That We Collect from Others**

We may supplement Personal Information that we have collected directly from you with other information that we obtain from third parties, including our service providers and affiliates. When we associate information that we obtain from affiliates and third parties (including our service providers) with Personal Information that we have collected directly from you, we will treat the acquired information the same as the information that we collected ourselves and, except as permitted by this Privacy Policy, the information will not be shared with third parties.

### 2\. Use and Disclosure of Information

Generally we use the Personal Information we collect about you in order to provide services such as the College Match or CPS Programs to you, as well as to personalize your account and to allow our network of colleges, universities, scholarship providers, internship programs, and others looking for outstanding students ("Associates") to contact you for the purposes of providing our services or responding to requests by you (e.g., responding to applications). We may also provide information to our Associates from time to time so that such Associates can contact you in order to make you aware of any opportunities that may be of interest to you or to respond to a service request by you. It is our policy not to disclose to our Associates any Personal Information without your consent (usually obtained via an "opt-in" option that you may select when filling out your application). QB may disclose your registration information for the purposes set forth above to those of our Associates for which you select the "opt-in" option during registration. QB may also use contact details that you provide to send you information about QB and how to improve your application or to respond to questions you may have. Any Personal Information provided to our Associates, either directly by you or by QB pursuant to your opt-in request, will be subject to our Associates' privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy. As such, we encourage you to review our Associates' privacy policies prior to providing, or opting-in for QB to provide your Personal Information to them.

**Legal Requirements**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may release your Personal Information to third parties: (1) in order to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, when we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of you or any other person.

### 3\. General Privacy Information

You are solely responsible for safeguarding and maintaining the secrecy of your username, passwords and/or any account information in your possession or control. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Further, the QB Website contains links to our Associates who may collect information directly from you. As mentioned above, each of the websites linked from the QB Website, including the websites of our Associates, have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of QB, and QB has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites nor does QB make any warranties or representations about the contents, products or services offered on such websites or the security of any information you provide to them.

### 4\. Security

The QB Website uses a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Information. Personal Information supplied by our users through the QB Website is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Personal Information collected on the QB Website is stored in a password protected environment that is not available to the public. As part of our information security program we: (i) designate one or more employees to coordinate and be accountable for our information security program; (ii) use reasonable efforts to identify material internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information that could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, loss, alteration, destruction, or other compromise of such Personal Information; (iii) design and implement physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to control such risks, and test or monitor the effectiveness of the safeguards' key controls, systems, and procedures; and (iv) evaluate and adjust our information security program as needed in light of the above. Although QB and its service providers use reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of your Personal Information, transmissions made on or through the Internet are vulnerable to attack and cannot be guaranteed to be secure.

### 5\. Protecting Yourself; Updating Your Information

You can learn more about Internet privacy from government websites such as www.ftc.gov/privacy/. In addition, it is important to keep us updated with your most current contact information.

Your continued use of the QB Website once the revised Privacy Policy has been posted on the QB Website affirms your agreement to such changes.
