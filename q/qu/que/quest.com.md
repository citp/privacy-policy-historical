# Privacy

We at Quest Software recognize the importance of protecting your personal information and we are committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

Because Quest Software respects its customers and understands that you are concerned about privacy, we have instituted policies and security measures intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. We also post this privacy policy so that you can agree to the kind of information we collect, how it is handled, and with whom it may be shared. This privacy policy applies to [www.quest.com](https://web.archive.org/).

By accessing or using the Quest Software Web site, you agree to the terms of this Quest Software Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not access or use this site. Quest Software is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

When you submit personal information to Quest Software, you understand and agree that Quest Software, its subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer, store, and process your customer profile in any of the countries in which Quest Software and its affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States.

Quest Software, its affiliates and subsidiaries collect this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select and to provide the products and services on the website. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. You agree that Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries can store and use your information for these purposes, including, if applicable, transferring your data to our third party payment processors. Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries use third party address verification software to verify the address provided is a correct mailing address. If you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries also use information that you provide as part of our effort to send you information about product upgrades, special offers, and other Quest products and services.

The distributor or partner may use these details to contact you about the support services that they may offer as well as other Quest products or services that you may be interested in. If you do not want to receive information from our distributors or partners, you may opt out by following the procedures set forth in the [Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update](https://web.archive.org/legal/privacy.aspx#choice) Section of this policy.
