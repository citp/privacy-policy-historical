**Privacy Policy**

 **Protecting Your Billing Information**

Protecting your private data is of utmost concern to us. When you purchase our products with a credit card, the billing information is encrypted and securely forwarded to a highly respected online credit card processing agent. We do not retain such information on any of our computer equipment. Our agent is [Card Service International](http://www.cardservice.com/), an industry leader in credit card processing for Internet businesses. 

**Protecting Your Personal Information**

When you make a purchase on our web site, you are asked to enter your name, email address and phone number. Such information is securely kept on our server and is only available to authorized employees. The server is placed behind a "firewall" to protect it from any potential intruders. The server has been setup and configured according to security guidelines recommended by the industry. 

**The Use of Your Personal Information**

Your billing information is not retained on our server. Your personal information is strictly used only to provide technical or sales support and to notify you of availability of fixes, new releases or our other complementary products. We do not share your personal information with any other companies without your explicit consent.

**Problems**

Please send any complaint about our compliance with this policy to [support@quetek.com](mailto:support@quetek.com). We will address any issues with the utmost urgency.
