We may share personal data to hosting providers and other suppliers, as required, who offer hosting and supplementary services. These suppliers will process personal data only on a need-to-know basis and as instructed by Questback to ensure a secure, reliable and high-performance user experience on this website.

**Marketing and CRM solutions**

We process your personal data for marketing purposes only to the extent permitted by privacy laws and regulations. To deliver marketing messages and ads and to manage our customer relations we use cloud-based services and applications. Our suppliers for such services and applications process personal data only as instructed by Questback and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

#### Webtracking

We share personal data with providers of website tracking tools to monitor the performance and usability of this website. For more information on website tracking [click here](https://www.questback.com/data-privacy/privacy-policy/#cookies).

**Social networks**

Our website uses social plugins ("plugins") from social networks, i.e. facebook ([facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com/)), twitter ([twitter.com](http://www.twitter.com/)), LinkedIn ([linkedin.com](http://www.linkedin.com/)) and Google+ ([plus.goggle.com](http://www.plus.google.com/)). These plugins can be recognized by their respective icons and/or logos.

We only use the share function (“share button”), which allows users to share our content to their profiles on social networks. In the event a user calls up the share function, his computer or device establishes a direct connection to the social network’s servers. Certain information is transmitted to the operator of the social network and, if logged in, integrated into the user’s profile. We have no influence on the type of data social networks actually collect with the help of this plugin. Such information may include session information, user ID, password, IP address and other personal data.

If the user is logged in to the social network, its operator can assign the visit to the user’s profile and identity. The social network is hereby enabled to create profiles on the user. If a user is neither logged in or a member of a social network, it is still possible for any network operator to obtain and store IP address and other data.

Users that do not want social networks to collect personal data via social plug ins must log out of their social network accounts before using our website and/or and delete all relevant cookies.
