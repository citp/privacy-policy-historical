# Privacy Policy

Information we get from your use of the network.

Your web browser tells us stuff like your approximate location and how you use the site. Information we get from your use of the network is primarily non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers, servers, and services like Google Analytics typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the time of each visit. Other non-identifying information that we might have access to includes how you use the service (e.g., search queries), your approximate location, cookies, etc.

Your browser also gives us your IP address, which could identify you, but we don’t use it to do that. When you use the network, we also collect potentially personally identifying information in the form of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. But we don’t use that information to identify you, and we handle and disclose these addresses in the same way we handle other potentially personally identifying information as described below.
