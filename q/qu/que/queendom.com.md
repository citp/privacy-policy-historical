The extensive battery of psychological tests is Queendom's signature feature. Information gathered from test-takers allows us to conduct scientific studies, validate our assessments and fine-tune them based on the results and conclusions drawn from the statistical analyses. 

All test questions must be answered before the test can be scored. At some point during the test administration, you may receive a Validation study form. This is a set of demographic and psychographic questions that are not used to score the test; rather, this information serves as a benchmark of a specific characteristic (also called a criterion measure). We then statistically analyze the test and the validation information to see how well the test scores predict the criterion

All fields in the surveys are optional. As with any research project, the integrity of our data is paramount. From statistical perspective, it is desirable to have as complete data as possible.
