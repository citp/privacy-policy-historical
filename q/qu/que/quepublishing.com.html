<div id="contentAll"><div id="contentAbout" xmlns=""><h1>Privacy Policy</h1><div class="pstFree"><p>We make every effort to preserve user privacy, however we may need to 
  disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith 
  belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law 
  enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order 
  or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>Que is operated from 800 East 96th Street, Indianapolis, IN, 46240, and is 
  part of the Pearson Education family. We can be reached at 
  <a href="mailto:comments@informit.com">comments@informit.com</a>.</p>
<p> We will not sell, share, or rent information to others in ways different from 
  what is disclosed in this statement. Quepublishing.com collects information 
  from our users at several different points on our website.</p>
<p>Pearson Education recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy 
  of Personal Identifying Information about you as a user of our Web site. 
  We consider the following information Personal Identifying Information: 
  your e-mail address, name, password, mailing address, and credit card 
  information. This Web site does not collect Personal Identifying Information 
  about a user other than information that is voluntarily provided to our 
  Company; in this way, we can serve the user's needs as well as our own 
  legitimate business purposes. (For example, we retain the Personal Identifying 
  Information that a user provides when he or she registers with Quepublishing.com, 
  part of the InformIT Network.)</p>
<p>Our company uses a user's Personal Identifying Information in order to 
  help us improve our Web site, or for our company's marketing and promotional 
  purposes if you have opted to receive these kinds of communications. This 
  information will be treated confidentially within our company. While our 
  policy is not to share this information with third parties, we do share 
  aggregate information with other companies within Pearson Education, Inc.</p>
<p>Que is a member of the InformIT Network. InformIT (<a href="http://www.informit.com" target="_blank">www.informit.com</a>) 
  is also part of the Pearson Education family, and follows the same privacy guidelines 
  outlined herein. InformIT is a member of TrustE, an online privacy verification 
  company. We encourage you to <a href="/about/privacy.asp">read Que's Privacy 
  policy</a> and verify Que's participation in TrustE's program.</p>
<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>
<p>In order to receive certain services pertaining to this site, you must 
  register. During registration a user is required to provide his or her 
  e-mail address. This e-mail address is used to contact the user about 
  the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is 
  optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as your 
  job, technical interests, etc.), but encouraged so we can provide personalized 
  services to the user, and learn more about our customers in aggregate.</p>
<p><strong>Order</strong></p>
<p>We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must 
  provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial 
  information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information 
  is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have 
  trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in 
  touch with the user.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive tied to aggregate 
  information about the user. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie 
  simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the 
  user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving 
  time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use 
  our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in 
  some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target 
  the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
<p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet 
  protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit 
  pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, 
  administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad 
  demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked 
  to personally identifiable information except to prevent fraud or abuse of the 
  system.</p><p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. 
  This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual 
  person. We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods 
  and services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable 
  information for any secondary purposes.</p>
<p>From time to time we partner with outside service providers. When the user 
  signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information 
  that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties 
  are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose 
  of providing these services.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we 
  (Quepublishing.com) are not responsible for the privacy practices of such 
  other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site 
  and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects 
  personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely 
  to information collected by this Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletters</strong></p>
<p>Upon registration a user has the option to receive Que and InformIT newsletters. 
  The user may opt-out of these at the time of registration, and never receive 
  a newsletter from Quepublishing.com thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Service Announcements</strong></p>
<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. 
  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might 
  send users an e-mail. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, 
  though they can deactivate their account information. However, these communications 
  are not promotional in nature. </p>
<p><strong>Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services 
  and in regard to issues relating to their account we reply via e-mail or phone 
  in accordance with the users' wishes when a user submits their information through 
  our Feedback and Comments form.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys and Contests</strong></p>
<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys 
  or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely 
  voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose 
  this information. Information requested may include contact information 
  (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such 
  as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the 
  winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes 
  of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter 
  sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) 
  on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure 
  socket layer technology (SSL). </p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information 
  submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method 
  of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% 
  secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means 
  to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an 
  e-mail to <a href="mailto:comments@informit.com">comments@informit.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Correction/Updating Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your e-mail 
  address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, 
  update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually 
  be done at the "account management page" or by e-mailing our Customer Support 
  at <a href="mailto:comments@informit.com">comments@informit.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>
<p>Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected 
  by any outside parties. When products or services are jointly offered or co-branded 
  we will indicate who is collecting the information and it will be clear which 
  privacy statement applies when information is being collected under a co-branded 
  situation. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether 
  they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. </p>
<p>If you choose to remove yourself from our mailing list(s) simply visit 
  the following page and uncheck any communication you no longer want to 
  receive:<br>
  <a href="/my_account/index.asp">http://www.quepublishing.com/my_account/index.asp</a></p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our 
  Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we 
  use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we 
  decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner materially different 
  from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of 
  an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information 
  in this different manner. However, if you have removed your personal information 
  you will not be contacted, nor will your information be used in this new manner. 
  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the 
  information was collected.</p>
