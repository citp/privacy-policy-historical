These Services also include optional services for safe navigation and search. The purpose is to enable you to control the use of these devices by their Users (as defined below), when and to the extent that such activity is permitted by applicable law and without infringing the rights of others (including the fundamental rights of Users) or other applicable regulations. 

We are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy and that of your Users (as defined in the Qustodio Terms of Service). This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the use of personal data collected and processed through our Services (as defined in the Qustodio Terms of Service, of which this Privacy Policy is a part). 

### Summary

Qustodio processes two types of personal data in relation to the Service: your account and contact data, for which it is responsible (as Data Controller), and your user data, collected from your devices, for which you are responsible.

\- Your account and contact data are used for managing our relationship with you, including activation, support, invoicing, and upselling.

The Qustodio platform automatically deploys the configuration and the instructions given by you and you are solely responsible for the configuration of this control panel. You can change those configurations at your option and provide instructions to limit and/or erase any data collected.

You warrant that (a) you have informed any Users that are 14 years old or more that the Devices used by them include a control and monitoring software and have obtained authorisation from such Users for this kind of activity, as provided in this Privacy Policy or (b) there are rules in your country that exempt you from the aforementioned obligation of information and consent, or provides for a different age limit, in which case that age limit will apply. Both Qustodio and you agree to fully comply with this Privacy Policy.

By using our Platform and Services, and in particular by providing your personal information on registration or contacting us for any reason, you explicitly accept this Privacy Policy and you provide us with full consent to the collection, storage and processing of personal data for which you are responsible in accordance with the terms set out in this policy, including the sending of our own electronic communications relating to our products and services. 

We may amend this Privacy Policy as required to adapt it to future legislative or case law developments. We will notify you by posting a clear notice of these changes on our Platform and in this Privacy Policy.

It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.

## 7\. User Rights

**Account Data:** you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal Account Data. You have the right to:

  * **Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

  * **Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

  * **Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

  * **Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights.

  * **Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

  * **Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

  * **Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.




You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

To exercise your rights, please contact us at info@qustodio.com or at Passeig de Gracia 18 Planta 2, Barcelona, Spain. 

You may address a complaint about the processing personal data to our supervisory authority which is the Spanish Data Protection Agency, at www.agpd.es.
