For such use, you may be required to provide your e-mail address and other personally-identifying information (such as your name, phone number or date of birth) as we may deem necessary under the circumstances. When you provide any personally identifying information, you acknowledge that you are knowingly and voluntarily providing us the information, and that all such information is accurate and up-to-date.

<br><br>
4.3 We collect certain usage information about our Services, such as the number and frequency of Users and/or Users' Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are automatically logged and are used by us and our partners to analyze user activity at an aggregate level, such as the number of visits and geographic optimization. This data is used only in the aggregate and does not include any personally identifying information. 
<br><br>
4.4 You have the right to access your information held by The Company and, where necessary, to have it amended. 
<br><br>
5.  INFORMATION SHARING
<br><br>
5.1 We do not sell, rent or pass on personally identifiable information to any third party other than as necessary to provide the Services unless we have your consent or as otherwise set forth herein. All third parties that require such information to provide the Services will agree to use any such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. 
        .<br><br>

Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time. 
<br><br>
7.2 E-mails you send us are not necessarily secure when they are transmitted. If your communication is sensitive or includes highly confidential information, you may want to provide it by post or via the telephone instead. However, credit card information should not be sent to us by fax, post or email as we only accept the use of encrypted online shopping carts for payments.
<br><br>
We instruct our employees with access to your information that it is to be used only in adherence with the provisions set forth in this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
<br><br>
8.  CREDIT CARD INFORMATION
