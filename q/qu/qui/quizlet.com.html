<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Quizlet we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>


<p>Quizlet LLC. ("<strong>Quizlet</strong>") operates <a href="http://quizlet.com">quizlet.com</a>. It is Quizlet's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.</p>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Quizlet collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Quizlet’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Quizlet’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Quizlet may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Quizlet also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Quizlet does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Quizlet's website choose to interact with Quizlet in ways that require Quizlet to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Quizlet gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at <a href="http://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a> to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Quizlet are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Quizlet collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Quizlet. Quizlet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>
<p>Quizlet.com is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>

<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Quizlet may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Quizlet may monitor the most popular word sets on the Quizlet site. Quizlet may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Quizlet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Quizlet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Quizlet's behalf or to provide services available at Quizlet's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Quizlet's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Quizlet will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Quizlet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Quizlet believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Quizlet, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Quizlet website and have supplied your email address, Quizlet may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Quizlet and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Quizlet takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Quizlet uses cookies to help Quizlet identify and track visitors, their usage of Quizlet website, and their website access preferences. Quizlet visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Quizlet's website, with the drawback that certain features of Quizlet's website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Quizlet may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Quizlet's sole discretion. Quizlet encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
