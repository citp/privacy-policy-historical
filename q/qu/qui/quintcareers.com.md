We completely respect the privacy of our site visitors, our newsletter subscribers, and those who respond to our surveys and questionnaires. EmpoweringSites.com has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. 

It is our policy: 

**Spam Emails:** We do **NOT** Spam. Period. If you think you were sent unsolicited email from QuintCareers.com or any of our Empowering Sites, you are **WRONG**. Look more closely at the headers and uncover the true spammer. The **ONLY** emails we ever send out are requested ones -- quiz and interview responses and _QuintZine_ subscriptions. We also do **NOT** sell or rent email lists. Your privacy and trust are important to us. We have a 100 percent no-spamming policy.  **Choice and Consent:** We respect the purpose for which our site visitors give us information. We give users choice and consent over how your personal information is used, and remove names or personal data upon your request.  **Third Party Use:** We will **_not_** sell, rent, or loan our lists to third parties for email marketing. While we sell advertising on our Web site and in our newsletter, we do not allow third parties any access to our lists.  **Subscriptions:** We send our periodicals only to those who request them, and immediately unsubscribe those who request it. While some people are accidentally subscribed by friends or associates, we will make every effort to have easy subscription information available on our Website and in our newsletters.  **Surveys:** The only survey we specifically ask our visitors to complete -- on a strictly voluntary basis -- is a demographic and Web usage survey that is controlled independently by our main advertising agency, BurstMedia.com. We never see any individual responses and we have little control over the questions; however, your answers help us with content, as well as with attracting advertisers.  **Cookies, Tracking Devices and Aggregated Information:** While Quintessential Careers does not use cookies or any other tracking devices, some of our advertisers and sponsors do use them. These companies may use anonymous aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number -- but including click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) about your visits to this and other websites \-- by using tracking cookies and other devices -- in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We cannot control their use and suggest you check their privacy policies. We do, however, encourage our advertisers and sponsors to act in an ethical and legal manner in all their endeavors. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).  **Contacting EmpoweringSites.com:** If you have any questions about this privacy policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this site, you can [contact us using this form](http://www.empoweringsites.com/contact-us.html).
