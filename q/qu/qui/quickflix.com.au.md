### Site content

The Quickflix website is frequently trawled and indexed by search engines such as Google. Please note that website content written and submitted by a member, for example a movie review, will often be indexed and will therefore be listed within these search engine directories. This type of website content may contain the name of the member who submitted the review, if this constitutes part of the website content. The indexing and retrieval of such site content within search engines such as Google is beyond the control of Quickflix.

### Mail (electronic and postal)

During the course of your membership, you will receive postal mail and/or emails from Quickflix that contain information relating to your account and the service provided to you as a member, including but not limited to website changes, product additions, news and current updates concerning the industry, website and account, product availability and the status of deliveries and/or returned items. 

After your membership, from time to time we may contact you regarding offers or promotions that may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these emails after your membership is closed you can unsubscribe from the Quickflix Mailing List by visiting:

### Links to external sites

Quickflix does not take any responsibility for its advertisers, outgoing links or any other part of its website that is not under direct or total control of Quickflix. We advise that users read the privacy policies of external sites before submitting personal information. 

### Cookies

Quickflix stores cookies on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your hard drive. Cookies are used to streamline the sign-in process so you don't need to retype the sign-in information each time you visit our site. Cookies are also used for security purposes and allow us to gather usage information which we use to administer and enhance our service and the website. If your browser is set to not accept cookies, you will not be able to use the Quickflix site or service. 

### Data quality

Quickflix takes all reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information we collect and use is accurate, complete and up-to-date. To this end we have provided a facility under "My account" for you to change, amend and update your personal details. It is your responsibility to make sure this information is accurate and complete. 

### Data security

Quickflix will take reasonable steps to ensure that all information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date and stored in a secure environment accessed only by authorised persons. Quickflix also takes reasonable steps to protect personal information it holds from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification and disclosure. 

Where credit card details are transmitted, we use 128-bit encryption through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. The common name of encryption certificate may be that of either Quickflix or Quickflix's official hosting partner. This encryption process ensures that the information you give us is protected against unauthorised access. If you have any queries concerning encryption please contact our Customer Service team. 

We have implemented technology and security features, as well as strict internal guidelines to safeguard the privacy of your personal information from unauthorised access. We will continue to enhance these features as technology changes and becomes available. Whilst we make every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
