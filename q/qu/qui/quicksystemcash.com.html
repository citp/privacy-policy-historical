      quickcashsystem.com respects the privacy of every individual who visits our websites. This privacy statement provides notice of the standards and terms under which quickcashsystem.com protects the privacy of information supplied by visitors to sites on the World Wide Web that are owned and operated by quickcashsystem.com, including quickcashsystem.com and <a href="index.html">quickcashsystem.com</a>. This privacy statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways in which your information may be used. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to review this information.
      <br><br>
      <strong>A. Personally-Identifiable Information:</strong><br>
      quickcashsystem.com typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally- identifiable information to quickcashsystem.com through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want quickcashsystem.com to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that quickcashsystem.com not use your information by sending an e-mail to: <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#bbcfd3decaced2d8d0d8dac8d3c8c2c8cfded6fbdcd6dad2d795d8d4d6">thequickcashsystem@gmail.com<script cf-hash="f9e31" type="text/javascript">

Absent any instructions from you, quickcashsystem.com may use information you provide to inform you about additional services and products offered by the quickcashsystem.com family of companies, quickcashsystem.com authorized agents, and other goods and services providers with whom quickcashsystem.com has relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you. quickcashsystem.com will not, however, sell or trade your personally-identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. On those quickcashsystem.com sites where you may provide quickcashsystem.com with credit card or other ordering information via the web, quickcashsystem.com protects and secures this information by employing commercially customary web- based security and encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). On those sites where you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like, quickcashsystem.com will treat that portion of the information as non-confidential and nonproprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement, quickcashsystem.com assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure.

      <strong>B. Non Personally-Identifiable (Generic) Information:</strong><br>
      In general, quickcashsystem.com gathers some generic information automatically. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors, and the quickcashsystem.com sites visited. quickcashsystem.com gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and website needs.

You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it.
