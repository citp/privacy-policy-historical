QuickRewards Network takes very seriously the trust placed in us by our members 
regarding the privacy and security of their personal data. The following Privacy 
Policy outlines the way in which user data may be collected and used. Usage of 
the QuickRewards.net website implies continued consent to these policies.<br>
<br>
<br>

- All site 
				visits generate a log that records date, time, duration of the 
				visit, IP address, referring website, browser type, operating 
				system, internet provider, and pages visited. Any attempt to 
				circumvent this log through the use of a proxy server and/or Virtual Private Network (VPN) may result  
				in account closure without payment.
				<br><br>
				- Member must 
				provide a valid email address for membership. We only require 
				you to submit your address and full name if you want to redeem 
				for a gift card/check shipped to you or for verification 
				reasons. We do not sell or trade any information to anyone. 
				<br><br>
				- You may 
				unsubscribe/delete your account at any time by either hitting 
				the unsubscribe link in any of our emails or emailing customer 
				service. 
				<br><br>
				- Member may 
				provide, through participation in third party surveys, general 
				demographic information that will be used in aggregate form by 
				these survey providers.
				<br><br>
				- Member may 
				choose to complete an in-depth demographic profile on the 
				QuickRewards.net website. This information will only be used for 
				the purposes of determining eligibility for targeted surveys. In 
				some instances, the survey providers may ask us to share with 
				them information form the demographic survey profiler you are 
				free to complete for more survey opportunities such as income, 
				gender and age for example, but they would not ask for name, 
				full address or phone unless it's some product test survey or 
				they need it to send you a reward/product. 
				<br><br>
				- Member's 
				encoded user ID may be collected by survey providers for the 
				purposes of recontacting members through the QuickRewards.net 
				website for follow-up surveys. In no way will members be 
				required to participate in these follow-up surveys.
				<br><br>
				- Member may 
				choose to provide personally identifiable information in the 
				course of completing third-party offers. These providers have 
				their own Privacy Policies and QuickRewards Network has no 
				control over or responsibility for the information voluntarily 
				provided by members to these providers.
				<br><br>
				- Some third 
				party clients (including video providers, banner advertisers, 
				and survey providers) may use cookies to better tailor their 
				content to the interests of individual QuickRewards Network 
				members. Some survey providers may have survey opportunities for 
				you based on the content they displayed as a result of them 
				using cookies. 
				<br><br>
				- Cookies must 
				be enabled in order for QuickRewards Network members to receive 
				cash back rewards for shopping through the links on the website.
				<br><br>
				- QuickRewards 
				Network will cooperate with legal authorities if personal member 
				information is demanded as part of an ongoing investigation.
				<br><br>
				- QuickRewards 
				Network may require proof of address and/or a photo ID to 
				confirm member identification as part of fraud prevention 
				procedures or should we need this information for some account 
				verification issue.
				<br><br>
				QuickRewards 
				Network reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any 
				time, without prior notification to the member.
