### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Quizlet collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Quizlet’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Quizlet’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Quizlet may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Quizlet also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Quizlet does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Quizlet's website choose to interact with Quizlet in ways that require Quizlet to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Quizlet gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at [Quizlet](http://quizlet.com/) to provide a username, date of birth, and email address. Those who engage in financial transactions with Quizlet are asked to provide additional information, such as name and credit card number. In each case, Quizlet collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Quizlet. Quizlet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally- identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or "UDID").

### Geo-Location Data

We do not ask you for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or services.

### Children

For children under 13, Quizlet offers a limited feature set and web site experience. We require consent from a parent when children under the age of 13 want to register on Quizlet and offer a limited version of the website that removes certain social features. The only identifiable information we collect from children under 13 is a parent’s email address.

### Safety on Quizlet

Children’s safety and full enjoyment of Quizlet, as well as the safety and well being for all children and their families, is of the utmost importance to all of us at Quizlet. Quizlet does not accumulate personal information about any child or family for distribution, sharing, or selling except as described in this privacy policy. We only keep an email on file for notifying parents of their child's wish to join Quizlet.

### Aggregated Statistics

Quizlet may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website and mobile applications. For instance, Quizlet may monitor the most popular word sets on the Quizlet site. Quizlet may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Quizlet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### How We Handle Personally Identifiable Information

Quizlet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Quizlet's behalf or to provide services available at Quizlet's website and mobile applications, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Quizlet's website and mobile applications, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Quizlet will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Quizlet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or when Quizlet believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Quizlet, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Quizlet website or mobile application and have supplied your email address, Quizlet may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Quizlet and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Quizlet takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. You may choose to stop receiving our email by updating your email settings within your profile or you can contact us at [quizlet.com/feedback](http://quizlet.com/feedback).

### Parental Rights

Parents and legal guardians of children under 13 who are members of Quizlet.com have certain rights under COPPA, and Quizlet recognizes those rights. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use of a child's personally identifiable information (PII) without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties. Currently the only identifiable information we collect from children under 13 is parent's email address.

Parents/guardians can review information their children have contributed to Quizlet.com, by accessing their child's account (login instructions are included in the "Direct Notice" email sent to all parents/guardians following their under 13 child's registration on Quizlet). Parents can also request that Quizlet delete that information and refuse to allow Quizlet to collect further information from their children by contacting our Customer Service department at [quizlet.com/feedback](http://quizlet.com/feedback). Quizlet may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from children.

A child's participation or access to an activity on Quizlet cannot be conditioned on him or her providing more information than is reasonably necessary for that activity, or any personally identifiable information. Quizlet does not collect personally identifiable information from children under 13, without a parent or guardian's consent.

### Study Set Discussion and Profile

Certain activity on Quizlet may be displayed to other users, such as posts to Quizlet discussion boards or our blog, or the information on your Quizlet Profile. This information includes your username, class names, and statistics.

You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from these areas, contact us at [quizlet.com/feedback](http://quizlet.com/feedback). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
