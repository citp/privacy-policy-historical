All of our sites are connected to one database. Your user profile only has to be established and/or edited at one location. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web sites. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. Our sites registration forms require users to give us contact information (like their name and E-mail address). We use customer contact information from the registration forms to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Our sites use forms for customers to request information, products, services, and support. We collect visitor information (like their account or credit card numbers).  
If you are purchasing something from Quick Article Pro, any third party provider, and we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us, or third party providers, to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. This information is used to send the invoice to you for products and services you purchase.
