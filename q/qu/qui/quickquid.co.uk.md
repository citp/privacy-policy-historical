**What Information We Collect**

You are free to browse the Website without providing any personal data (although, please see the "Cookies" section below). Our primary goal in collecting Personal Data is to provide you with an accurate, customised loan transaction. The information we collect about our customers helps us personalise and continually improve our customers' experience at our Website and their experience of services provided by us and our affiliates. We collect the following types of information: 

  * Web page http headers (home server domain names, IP address, type of client computer, and type of Web browser). 
  * Information provided by you through on-line forms, loan applications, surveys, and/or other entries, such as names, email addresses, home addresses, date of birth, personal, financial (bank account details) or demographic information. 
  * Information, user specific or aggregate, on what pages our visitors access. 
  * Automatic information and cookies (See also the "Cookies" section below). 
  * Information about your transactions with us, such as payment history and loan balances, and information you provide when you contact our customer service department.

  * To ensure that we are providing materials of interest to you, we may monitor whether you have clicked on the images and/or links therein. Our email communications may include HTML-based email messages, which includes a coded sensor that is activated when the email message is opened. This sensor communicates to us the date and time the message was opened and, more importantly, whether your computer is capable of receiving HTML-based email. You will receive a functioning sensor only if your computer is enabled to accept HTML email. 



**How We Use and Disclose Personal Data**

We use your Personal Data to process your loan transaction such as verifying your identity and credit standing to enable us to consider and process your application, to assess your credit history and the validity of your debit card details by processing one or more test transactions which shall not result in any money being taken from your account and will not affect your credit history, confirm your employment details, enhance your experience of our Website and of our services, and (as described in the next section below) to transmit marketing communications. We may also use your Personal Data for such purposes as processing payments, updating and maintaining our records, of your dealings and relationship with us, conducting statistical analysis and for editorial or feedback purposes for our advertisers. 

We may store and use your Personal Data for our own business or operational purposes, for example to ensure that we do not collect inaccurate or duplicate information about you. We may also process your Personal Data for the purposes of complying with legal obligations. 

When you provide your Personal Data to us, you are consenting to sharing it with our agents and other parties as further described herein: 

  * Service Providers: We contract with service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include database providers who assist in identity verification, magazine publishers, retailers, direct marketers, and site analysis providers such as ClickTale (for further details of ClickTale please see above). Their access is limited only to the Personal Data needed to perform the functions carried out on our behalf as our agent, and only for the purpose of performing those functions, and they are prohibited from using or disclosing the Personal Data for other purposes. 
  * Credit Reference Agencies: We use credit reference agencies (CRAs) to assess your application for credit and verify your identity to prevent crime and money laundering. We may also, make periodic searches at CRA’s in order to refresh our records and manage your account with us. Information on applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by them. When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. They supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information. Where you borrow from us, we will give details of your account(s) and how you manage it/them to CRAs. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRA’s will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe. Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted. You can contact the CRAs currently operating in the UK; the information they hold may not be the same so it is worth contacting them all. They will charge you a small statutory fee for the provision of information.
