**Use of Personal Data**

You are free to browse the Website without providing any personal data (although, please see the "Cookies" section below). We use your personal data to provide you with an accurate, customised loan contract. Without this data, we may not be able to offer you a loan. Once you submit an application on our website, we gather data from credit reference agencies and other vendors to confirm identity, check for fraud and evaluate creditworthiness.

In certain circumstances, we may request bank statements as part of the loan decision process. If you choose to log onto your bank account as part of this application process, we will be provided with 60 days of transactions from your bank.

We may also receive your information from third party credit brokers. As part of your application through any of our partners, you should be informed which companies your data will be shared with.

This process takes into account customer stated data such as income, expenses, employment information (e.g., information you provide us on your application) as well as 3rd party data such as credit reference data or published national household income and expense averages to judge creditworthiness of an applicant and the affordability of the requested loan. Such automation ensures that each customer is treated consistently and is evaluated objectively, and allows us to make fair and responsible lending decisions. For more information about your rights as it relates to automated processing, please see the section on Objection to Automated Decision Making, below.
