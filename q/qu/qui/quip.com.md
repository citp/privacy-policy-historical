# Quip

Thank you for using Quip. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use Quip. This Privacy Policy only applies to Quip and doesn’t apply to anyone else’s websites, services, or applications, even if you can access those through Quip.

## Information We Collect and How We Use It

### Account Information

When you create an account, we collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, and if you are using a paid account, postal address, phone number, and credit card billing information (“personally identifiable information” or “PII”). We may also collect information like your gender, date of birth and zip code. If you choose to create a Quip account via a third-party service such as Google or Facebook, you may have to provide us with your username or user ID so that your identity can be authenticated. When the authentication is complete, we’ll be able to access certain information based on your permissions from the third-party service. We don’t receive or store passwords for any accounts on third-party services.

### Information Collected Using Cookies

We collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access Quip. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to Quip and to tell us how and when you’ve used it. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing and to customize and improve Quip. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of Quip. Some third-party services providers that we use may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.

### Information Related to Use of Quip

Our servers automatically record information about how a person uses Quip, including IP addresses, browser types, operating systems, pages or features of Quip that were used and time spent on them, search terms and other statistics. We use and analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to customize and improve Quip. We also use IP addresses to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how Quip is used.

### Location Information

In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize Quip.

## Information We Share With Third Parties

We’ll only share your PII in the following cases:

  * We use a third-party service provider that requires it, such as for payment processing, data storage, and hosting and servers.
  * We need to disclose it as part of a business transaction. Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
  * We need to do so for legal reasons or to protect ourselves or others. We strongly believe in protecting you from having your privacy violated through abuse of legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government, and in contesting claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law. However, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if we believe it is necessary to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation or legal process; to respond to lawful requests; to protect the rights, property and safety of us or others; and to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.
  * You expressly ask us to do so.



We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.

## Modifying Your Information

To delete your PII and cancel your account, please send an email to [legal@quip.com](mailto:legal@quip.com). We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.

## International Transfer

Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.

## Safe Harbor

Quip complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Quip has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, Quip commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Quip at:

Quip has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints](http://www.bbb.org/council/eusafeharbor/bbb-eu-safe-harbor-dispute-resolution-program/) for more information and to file a complaint.

## Our Policy Towards Children

Quip is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as is practicable.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

Any information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, revise the Privacy Policy from time to time. If a revision—in our sole discretion—is material, we will notify you (for example via email to the email address associated with your account). Other changes may be posted to our blog, so please check that regularly. The most current version will always be posted on our Privacy Policy page.
