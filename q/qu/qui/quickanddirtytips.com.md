Passive Collection of Information

When you visit our Web site, your browser automatically sends us certain Internet-related information, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you’re using and your originating domain.  We also collect certain information about our Web site visitors, such as how many users visited our site, the average time spent on the site, the pages viewed, and referring Web sites.  By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our Web site to our visitors.  While we generally examine such information only in the aggregate, such information could be linked back to individual IP addresses.  
We use cookies on our Web site.  Cookies are small text files that Web sites often store on the computer hard drives of visitors.  A cookie contains a unique code which is used to recognize your computer.  We use cookies to enhance the online experience of our visitors, to better understand how the site is used, and to administer certain activities.  The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies.  Remember, though, if you disable all cookies, you many not be able to take advantage of all features of this Web site.

**How We Share Information**

**QDT** does not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information we collect through [www.quickanddirtytips.com](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/) **** except as described here. We may share the information you provide with companies that are related to **QDT** through common ownership. We also share information provided by our Web site visitors with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. In addition, we may share information about you with non-affiliated third parties whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. These third parties may contact you about their products and services. We will not share your information with these third parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so. We may, however, engage in joint marketing activities with selected third parties and may share personal information about our Web site visitors with them. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to legal process, (iii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the transferee uses personal information you have provided through this Web site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

**Links to Other Web Sites**

This Web site provides links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. These sites may operate independently from [www.quickanddirtytips.com](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/), and may not be under our control; they may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review. **  QDT** may not be responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or the privacy practices of these sites.

**Children's Privacy**

This Web site is intended for an audience of adult readers, and is not meant for children. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

**Security**

We use administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the information we collect against foreseeable hazards.  Please note, however, that perfect security does not exist on the Internet.

**Your Choices**

We give you the option of requesting that we not share personal information we collect about you with third parties that are unrelated by common ownership with **QDT** for marketing use. Click [contact@quickanddirtytips.com](mailto:contact@quickanddirtytips.com) to send us an e-mail with your name and e-mail address(es) if you DO NOT want us to share your personal information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing use.

We also give you the option of requesting that we not share your information with companies related to **QDT** by common ownership for marketing use. However, PLEASE NOTE that, because of the integrated nature of the businesses of **QDT** and some of these companies, if you opt out of sharing with them, you will also automatically be opted out of marketing use by **QDT**. That means that you will not receive our e-newsletter or information from us about podcasts, books, promotions and services. Click [contact@quickanddirtytips.com](mailto:contact@quickanddirtytips.com)with your name and e-mail address(es), if you do not want us to share your information with related companies for marketing use (or use the information for marketing purposes ourselves). (Keep in mind, however, that some of our related companies may have independently obtained your information, in which case you may continue to receive communications from those companies, unless you opt out directly with them.)

Please be aware that we are able to effectuate an opt-out only for a specific e-mail address. So, if you have more than one e-mail address or if you have changed your email address, your opt-out request may not be effectuated properly. If you believe you have opted out, but continue to receive e-mails from us, please contact us by one of the means listed under “How to Contact Us”, below, and we will endeavor to resolve the issue.

**Updates to This Privacy Notice**
