# Privacy Policy :: Quick and Dirty Tips ™

**EFFECTIVE DATE: 4/1/2014**

We at Quick and Dirty Tips, a division of Macmillan Holdings, LLC ("we" or "QDT") respect your concerns about privacy and value the relationship we have with you. This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information we collect through http://www.quickanddirtytips.com, how we may use that information, and with whom we may share it.   This Privacy Notice also describes the measures we take to protect the security of information we collect through this website.  In addition, we describe the choices you can make about how we use the information you provide to us. We also tell you how you can reach us to update your contact information, contact us with general questions or comments, inquire about our company and its products and services, or answer any questions you may have about our privacy practices.

**How We Use Information We Collect**

Information collected through this website is used in connection with the purpose for which it was submitted (for example, to send you a newsletter, to contact you to answer a question, or to send you information on a product you’ve requested).

We may also use the information we collect to send you information or products we think may be of interest to you, to customize our contacts with you and to do other internal analyses, such as market research, that will allow us to better meet the needs of our customers.

**Information We Collect:**

**Getting Our Newsletters and Other Products**

On occasion, we may offer newsletters, giveaways or other promotional items. In these instances, we will request your contact information (such as name and mailing address) to fulfill your request, and may request other information that we think is useful or relevant.

**Surveys and Questionnaires**

We may ask visitors to our website to complete online surveys and opinion polls on a variety of topics, such as their activities, attitudes, and interests, and our products and services. These surveys help us understand the needs of our visitors.

**Sweepstakes, Contests, and Promotions**

From time to time, we may run sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, some of which you may enter online. If you choose to participate, we may ask you for your contact information. In some cases, we also may ask you for other information in connection with the promotion.

**Comments**

This website permits users to submit comments on issues relating to the subject matter covered by the website. Please be aware that some or all information you provide (including personally identifiable information) in connection with comments you submit may become publicly available. This site may also offer you the ability to interact with plugins from social media sites, such as, but not limited to, Facebook, Linkedin, and Twitter.  If you have previously provided personally identifiable information to a third-party running a plugin like one of these on this website, that third-party may recognize you here. Your use of social network plugins is subject to each social media site’s privacy policy, which may be different from ours, so please read these policies to assess and understand your options. We have no control over the information that is collected, stored, or used by third-party plugins. 

**"Contact Us"**

You may choose to contact us through our website. If you e-mail us, we will have your e-mail address, as well as any other information you choose to provide but this information will only be used to respond to your query unless you indicate otherwise.

**Passive Collection of Information**

When you visit our website, your browser automatically sends us certain Internet-related information, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you’re using and your originating domain.  We also collect certain, non-personally identifiable information about our website visitors, such as how many users visited our site, the average time spent on the site, the pages viewed, and referring websites.  By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors.  While we generally examine such information only in the aggregate, such information could be linked back to individual IP addresses.

**Cookies**

**Use of Cookies:  **Our website uses cookies. By using our website and agreeing to this policy, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy.

**About cookies:  **Cookies are files, often including unique identifiers, that are sent by web servers to web browsers, and which may then be sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies can be used by web servers to identity and track users as they navigate different pages on a website, and to identify users returning to a website. Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date). A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.

**Cookies on this website:  **We use both session cookies and persistent cookies on this website.

**How we use cookies:  **Cookies do not contain any information that personally identifies you, but personal information that we store about you may be linked, by us, to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. The cookies used on this website include those which are strictly necessary cookies for access and navigation, cookies that track usage (performance cookies), remember your choices (functionality cookies), and cookies that provide you with targeted content or advertising. We may use the information we obtain from your use of our cookies for the following purposes: 

(1) to recognize your computer when you visit our website 

(2) to track you as you navigate our website

(3) to improve the website's usability 

(4) to analyze the use of our website 

(5) in the administration of this website 

(6) ) to personalize our website for you, including targeting advertisements which may be of particular interest to you. 

**Third party cookies and web beacons:  **When you use our website, you may also be sent cookies by third-party advertisers and service providers. For example, collection of site usage information is performed on our behalf by a third party service provider. In addition to cookies, such third parties may use web beacons to obtain notification of web page access by visitors. Such third parties may retain usage information they obtain from these cookies or web beacons for their own purposes, including, without limitation: 

(1) to track your browser across multiple websites 

(2) to build a profile of your web surfing 

(3) to target advertisements which may be of particular interest to you. 

The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers or mobile devices will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies.  Remember, though, if you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all features of this website. To learn more about how third-party, non-personally identifiable data gathering works and your options for opting out, visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/

**How We Share Information**

QDT does not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information we collect through www.quickanddirtytips.com except as described here. We may share the information you provide with companies that are related to QDT through common ownership. We also share information provided by our website visitors with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. In addition, we may share information about you with non-affiliated third parties whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. These third parties may contact you about their products and services. We will not share your information with these third parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so. We may, however, engage in joint marketing activities with selected third parties and may share personal information about our website visitors with them. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to legal process, (iii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the transferee uses personal information you have provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

**Links to Other Websites**

This website provides links to other websites for your convenience and information. These sites may operate independently from www.quickanddirtytips.com, and may not be under our control; they may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review.  QDT may not be responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or the privacy practices of these sites.

**Children's Privacy**

This website is intended for an audience of adult readers, and is not meant for children. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

**Security**

We use administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the information we collect against foreseeable hazards.  Please note, however, that perfect security does not exist on the Internet.

**Your Choices**

We give you the option of requesting that we not share personal information we collect about you with third parties that are unrelated by common ownership with QDT for marketing use. Click [contact@quickanddirtytips.com](mailto:contact@quickanddirtytips.com) to send us an e-mail with your name and e-mail address(es) if you DO NOT want us to share your personal information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing use.

We also give you the option of requesting that we not share your information with companies related to QDT by common ownership for marketing use. However, PLEASE NOTE that, because of the integrated nature of the businesses of QDT and some of these companies, if you opt out of sharing with them, you will also automatically be opted out of marketing use by QDT. That means that you will not receive our e-newsletter or information from us about podcasts, books, promotions, and services.

Email [contact@quickanddirtytips.com](mailto:contact@quickanddirtytips.com) with your name and e-mail address(es), if you do not want us to share your information with related companies for marketing use (or use the information for marketing purposes ourselves). (Keep in mind, however, that some of our related companies may have independently obtained your information, in which case you may continue to receive communications from those companies, unless you opt out directly with them.)

Please be aware that we are able to effectuate an opt-out only for a specific e-mail address. So, if you have more than one e-mail address or if you have changed your email address, your opt-out request may not be effectuated properly. If you believe you have opted out, but continue to receive e-mails from us, please contact us by one of the means listed under “How to Contact Us,” below, and we will endeavor to resolve the issue.

**Updates to This Privacy Notice**

We may change or update portions of this Privacy Notice at any time and without prior notice to you. Please check back from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the Notice. We will indicate the effective date of the Notice at the top.
