<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="cnk">We at QuinStreet, Inc. and our affiliated companies  worldwide ("QuinStreet") are committed to respecting your online privacy  and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of  any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you  share with us.</p>
<p class="cnk">QuinStreet has established this Online PRIVACY POLICY  so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your  Personal Information.</p>
<p class="cnk">Personal Information means any information that may be  used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first  and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address or  other contact information. In general, you can visit QuinStreet's Web  pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal  Information about yourself.</p>
<p class="cnk">If you choose to provide us with your Personal  Information on the Web, we may transfer that Information within  QuinStreet or to QuinStreet's third-party service providers, across  borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or  jurisdictions around the world.</p>
<p class="cnk">QuinStreet strives to comply with all applicable laws  around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although  legal requirements may vary from country to country, QuinStreet intends  to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online PRIVACY POLICY even  if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information  from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level  of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal  is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where  that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.</p>
<h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p class="cnk">Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other  tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used,  for example, to collect information about website activity. Some  cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information  previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control  cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.</p>
<p class="cnk">You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a  cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but  please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will  need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to  certain parts of the website.</p>
<p>If you prefer that your browser does not store this cookie information,  there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this  feature. In order to "opt out" of the benefits of cookies, you can  manually delete your cookies by following the instructions contained in  the "Help" section of your browser. Alternatively, simply click the "OPT OUT NOW" link provided, below.  QuinStreet uses a limited number of  third party providers to manage cookies, and when you click the link  below, you will be opted out of their tracking systems.  Note that  separate browser windows will be opened, and you need to allow pop-ups  for this to happen.</p>
<p><a href="http://assets.invitemedia.com/opt-out.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Opt Out Now</a></p>

<h2>Choice<a name="choice"></a></h2>
<p class="cnk">You may choose whether or not to provide Personal  Information to QuinStreet.
