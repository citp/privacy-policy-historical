<dt id="use_of_information" class="faq_category">How We Use and Disclose Personal Data</dt>
<dd id="pp_use_of_information" class="faq faq_answer">

<p>We use your Personal Data to process your loan transaction such as verifying your identity and credit standing to enable us to consider and process your application, to assess your credit history and confirm your employment details, enhance your experience of our Website and of our services, and (as described in the next section below) to transmit marketing communications. We may also use your Personal Data for such purposes as processing payments, updating and maintaining our records, of your dealings and relationship with us, conducting statistical analysis and for editorial or feedback purposes for our advertisers.</p>
<p>We may store and use your Personal Data for our own business or operational purposes, for example to ensure that we do not collect inaccurate or duplicate information about you.  We may also process your Personal Data for the purposes of complying with legal obligations.</p>
<p>When you provide your Personal Data to us, you are consenting to sharing it with our agents and other parties as further described herein:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Service Providers: We contract with service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include database providers who assist in identity verification, magazine publishers, retailers, direct marketers, and site analysis providers such as ClickTale (for further details of ClickTale please see above).  Their access is limited only to the Personal Data needed to perform the functions carried out on our behalf as our agent, and only for the purpose of performing those functions, and they are prohibited from using or disclosing the Personal Data for other purposes. </li> 
  <li>
      <p>Credit Reference Agencies: We use credit reference agencies (CRAs) to assess your application for credit and verify your identity to prevent crime and money laundering. We may also, make periodic searches at CRA’s in order to refresh our records and manage your account with us. Information on applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by them. When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. They supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information. Where you borrow from us, we will give details of your account(s) and how you manage it/them to CRAs. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRA’s will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe. Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted. You can contact the CRAs currently operating in the UK; the information they hold may not be the same so it is worth contacting them all. They will charge you a small statutory fee for the provision of information.</p>

          <p>Terms and Conditions apply. All loans are subject to status and affordability checks prior to approval. All applicants must be 18 or over. Finance charge will be between £20 and £29.50 per £100 borrowed depending on your credit score. <sup>†</sup>Loan amounts are based on consumer's credit history and ability to repay loan in accordance with QuickQuid's affordability policy. Not everyone may qualify for £1500. Maximum of £1000 for first time customers. <sup>§</sup>This timer is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent when the funds will be deposited into your account. The timer corresponds to the next available funding start time, which could be your actual funding start time depending on when your loan is approved. Once approved, funds will be sent to your account within 10 minutes. If your bank does not support <a href="http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/sort_code_checker/-/page/284/">Faster Payments</a>, funds will only be deposited the same day, if approved by 14:30. <a href="/payday-loans-in-10-minutes.html">Learn more</a>. <sup>¶</sup>Approval may take up to 30 minutes in most cases. QuickQuid performs traditional credit checks and verifies applicant information via various national databases. Payday advances should be used for short-term financial needs only, not as a long-term financial solution. Customers with credit difficulties should seek credit counselling.
