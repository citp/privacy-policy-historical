                address, etc) some of which may constitute Personal Data.
                <br>
                    <br>
                    Privacy Policy Links: We make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy
                in the footer of every page on the Site, including those pages on which Personal

                non- identifiable information ("Non-Personal Data"). The Non-Personal Data we collect
                includes without limitation Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, domain names of your
                Internet Service Provider, your approximate geographic location, a record of the
                Site pages that you visit, the time of your visits and aggregated Personal Data
                that cannot be used to specifically identify you. Such information, which is collected
                passively using various technologies is strictly for statistical purposes and cannot,
                in and of itself, be used to specifically identify you.
                <br>
                    <br>
                    Cookies: In operating the Site, we use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is
                a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser
                when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the
                Site and help us analyse Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may
                set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing
                to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site.
                These cookies may be used to tailor content you see on the Site as well as other
                sites that you may visit in the future. Through your web browser's option settings
                you may be able (i) to receive notifications when you are receiving new cookies,
                (ii) to disable cookies or (iii) to delete cookies. Please refer to your web browser's
                help section for information on how to do this. We recommend that you leave cookies
                turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.
                <br>
                    <br>
                    Google Analytics: This cookie allows us to see information on user website activities including, but not limited to page views, source and time spent on website. The information is depersonalised and is displayed as numbers, meaning it cannot be tracked back to individuals. This will help to protect your privacy. Using Google Analytics we can see what content is popular on our website, and strive to give you more of the things you enjoy reading.
                <br>
                    <br>
                    DoubleClick: We use remarketing codes to log when users view specific pages, allowing us to provide targeted advertising in the future when you visit other websites which display Google Ads.
                <br>
                    <br>
                    Aggregated Personal Data: In an on-going effort to better understand and serve the
                users of the Site and Quicket Services, Quicket often conducts research on its customer
                demographics, interests and behaviour based on Personal Data and other information
                that we have collected. This research may be compiled and analysed on an aggregate
                basis and this aggregate information is strictly for statistical purposes and does
                not identify you personally and therefore is considered and treated as Non-Personal
                Data under this Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <h2>Our Use of Information That We Collect:</h2>
                <h3>1. Personal Data:</h3>
                <p>
                    Quicket uses the Personal Data we collect in a manner that is consistent with this
                Privacy Policy. Quicket may use the Personal Data as follows:
                </p><ul>
                    <li>Specific Reason: If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the
                        Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance,
                        if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer
                        your question or resolve your problem and will respond to the email address from
                        which the contact came. </li>
                    <li>Access and Use: If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use
                        of the Site or Quicket Services or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal
                        Data to provide you with access to or use of such services or functionality and
                        to monitor your use of such services or functionality. For instance, if you supply
                        payment information (e.g., bank account or credit card information) to the Site
                        for the purpose of purchasing tickets as a Buyer or processing payments as an Organizer,
                        Quicket will use that information to facilitate such purchase or process such payments.</li>
                    <li>Internal Business Purposes: Quicket may use your Personal Data for internal business
                        purposes including without limitation to help us improve the content and functionality
                        of the Site, to better understand our users, to improve the Quicket Services, to
                        protect against, identify or address fraudulent activities, to enforce our Terms
                        of Service, to manage your account and provide you with customer service, and to
                        generally manage the Site, Quicket Services and our business.</li>
                    <li>Marketing: Quicket may use your Personal Data to contact you in future marketing
                        and advertising purposes, including without limitation to inform you about services
                        or events we believe might be of interest to you, to develop promotional or marketing
                        materials and provide those materials to you, and to display content and advertising

                <br>
                    <br>
                    Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses

                <br>
                    <br>
                    Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Quicket, like many businesses, sometimes

                of such functions include mailing information, ticket fulfilment, maintaining databases
                and processing payments. When we engage another company to perform such functions,
                we may provide them with information, including Personal Data, in connection with
                their performance of such functions.
                <br>
                    <br>
                    Organizers: When you purchase tickets to, register for or donate to an event on
                our Site, you consent to our providing your Personal Data to the Organizers of such
                event. These Organizers are not bound to treat your Personal Data in accordance
                with this Privacy Policy. You agree that Quicket is not responsible for the actions
                of these Organizers with respect to your Personal Data. It is important that you
                review the applicable policies of the Organizers of an event before providing Personal
                Data or other information in connection with that event.
                <br>
                    <br>
                    Legal Requirements: Quicket may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so
                by law (including, without limitation responding to a subpoena or request from law
                enforcement, court or government agency) or in the good faith belief that such action
                is necessary (i) to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect and defend the
                rights or property of Quicket, (iii) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the
                personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) to protect against legal
                liability.

                    Limit the Personal Data You Provide: You can use the Site without providing any

                <br>
                    <br>
                    an unsubscribe request. Note that you cannot unsubscribe from Quicket Service communications

                you opt out of all communications, Quicket will retain your Personal Data and Non-
                Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however, we will no longer
                use it to contact you. Organizers who have received your Personal Data in accordance
                with this Privacy Policy may continue to use that Personal Data to contact you in
                accordance with their own privacy policies, but they may not use Quicket's system
                to do so.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Quicket other

                through the Site or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to,

                and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All
                Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Quicket shall
                be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited Information

                <h2>Children:</h2>
                <p>
                    Quicket does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of
                18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Data through
                the Site. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet
                usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never
                to provide Personal Data on the Site without their permission. If you have reason
                to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Data to Quicket
                through the Site, please contact us and we will endeavour to delete that information
                from our databases.

                policies.

                it believes to be reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the

                and destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure
                or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Site may not be secure.
