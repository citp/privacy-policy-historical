                <h2>What Data do we Process?</h2>
                <p>

We only collect and process data where we have a legal basis to do so:
                    </p>
                <p>
</p><h3>1. Data Necessary to Perform a Ticket Purchase.</h3>
In order to facilitate a legally valid online sale of tickets for, or donations to,
events, we need to collect certain essential data which is submitted by users of
our website. This includes information which identifies the relevant Organiser,
and Buyer(s), such as names and email addresses, information regarding the
event for which a ticket is purchased, the type of ticket purchased, the ticket
price, and financial information pertaining to the Organiser and the Buyer, so that
online payments may be facilitated.
<p></p>
                <h3>2. Data in which we have a Legitimate Interest.</h3>
                <p>


We have a legitimate interest in collecting and processing data which enables us
to operate our ticketing platform and provide the ticketing services we offer.
For Organisers and Buyers, this data collected by us may include:<br>
                    </p><ul>
<li>Name</li>

                        </ul>
                    <br>
We may collect indirect information from all users of our website in order to
maintain our website’s basic functionality, or to anonymously track what users do
on our website, in the form of cookies. This includes IP addresses, and web
browser information.
                    <p></p>
                <h3>3. Data for which you have provided Consent.</h3>
                <p>

As an Organiser or Buyer, when creating an account with Quicket, you are asked
to consent to us collecting and processing data in accordance with this policy.
                    <br>
Buyers who are not account holders are asked to consent to us collecting data
submitted by the Buyer during the ticket purchase process.
                    <br>
All users of our website consent to the use of cookies when landing on any page
of our online platform for the first time.
                    <br>
Your consent may be withdrawn at any time, but only in relation to the
processing of data which is not necessary for our website to function, for a valid
transaction to be concluded via our website, or as part of our legitimate interest
in operating our ticketing platform and providing the ticketing services we offer.
                    </p>
                <h2>How do we Collect Data?</h2>
<h3>1. Direct Collection</h3>
                <p>


Data will be submitted by Organisers and Buyers at the time a Quicket account
is created, or at the time a ticket purchase, or donation, is made. Data may also
be submitted by users submitting information or help requests, completing
surveys
</p>
                <h3>2. Indirect Collection</h3>
                <p>

We use cookies and similar technologies on our website:
                    </p><ul>
<li>cookies that are required for our website to operate normally (these do contain
personally identifiable information);</li>
<li>anonymous tracking cookies used to determine what users do on our
website e.g. Google Analytics (these do not by themselves contain
personally identifiable information);</li>
<li>third party cookies e.g. cookies used for tracking site usage from a third-
party platform (such as Facebook) and/or for re-marketing. Users are
asked to consent to this type of cookie monitoring and this consent may
be withdrawn at any time.</li>
                        </ul>
                <p></p>
                <h2>What Do we do with your Data?</h2>
                <p>

We use data collected by us, directly and indirectly, as may be necessary to operate
our ticketing platform and in order to provide ticketing services, or data collected by
us with the user’s consent. Data is also used to ensure our website functions
properly, and in order to optimise and improve our service offering.
                    <br><br>
Event information submitted by Organisers will be publicly available on the website.
Organisers are responsible for the information submitted by them and acknowledge
that this information will be displayed publicly.
                    <br><br>
We will share Buyers’ names, contact and ticket information, with the relevant
Organisers pursuant to a ticket purchase only insofar as is necessary so that
Organisers can monitor who is attending an event. Organisers are not bound to treat
data in accordance with this privacy policy. Users agree that Quicket is not
responsible for the actions of these Organisers with respect to your data. It is
important that you review the applicable policies of the Organisers of an event before
providing personal data or other information in connection with that event.
                    <br><br>
We may contact users directly or through a third-party service provider regarding
products or services a user has signed up for or purchased from us, such as may be
necessary to deliver transactional or service related communications. Quicket may
also contact you with offers for additional services we think you'll find valuable if you
give us consent, or where allowed based upon legitimate interests.
                    <br><br>
We may share personal data with trusted third parties as necessary for them to
perform services on our behalf, such as processing credit card payments. We only
share personal data as necessary for any third party to provide the services as
requested or as needed on our behalf. These third parties (and any subcontractors)
