<p>Here is how and why we collect and use information from you:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<a name="tools"></a><li><a name="tools"><b>Registration for Tools, Planners and Personalized Services.</b> We provide a number of tools,
planners and other interactive advisors to help you manage your financial life,

</a><a name="process"></a><p>Intuit does not share your contact information with

home ownership, insurance and other calculators to help you make the best
financial decisions for you and your family. The financial information you

provided in each e-mail newsletter.

address. We may use your contact information in order to contact you regarding
service updates or specific support questions and may contact you for
additional opportunities to provide feedback on our products and services.

your computer's capabilities and (2) determine whether you've opened a graphically formatted (HTML) e-mail. When
you click on a link within an e-mail message, such as Quicken.com newsletter,
you will first pass through our server, then you are redirected onto the
Internet. We use this click-through data on an
aggregate level to evaluate response rates to our e-mail messages and to
determine which links are most useful to our customers.
</li><li><b>Service Providers.</b> In some
cases, we will employ or work with service providers such as consultants,
temporary workers, third party software developers or outsourcers to complete a
business process or provide a service on our behalf. For example, we may use
service providers to deliver products, offer online software applications or
send e-mails. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your
personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited
from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to
act on our behalf.
</li><li><b>Service Alerts and Critical Notices.</b> Although we respect
and honor the privacy preferences you have expressed, we may nevertheless
contact you to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to
use this service or for other critical non-marketing purposes, such as bug
alerts. We may also contact you to respond
to your specific requests or to clarify the order information you provided to
us.
</li><li><b>Changes to Our Privacy Policies.</b> If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies
or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information,
we'll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take
effect.
</li><li><b>Change of Control.</b> Your personally identifiable information may be transferred in
connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition
(whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of
Intuit and/or its subsidiaries. You will have the opportunity to opt out of
further secondary use of your information following any change of control.
</li><li><b>Legal Disclosure.</b> In some
cases we may to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process,
such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request. </li></ul>

<p>Here is how and why we use some common Web

<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Cookies.</b>
A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web sites may
