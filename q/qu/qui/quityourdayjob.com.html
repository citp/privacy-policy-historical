              <p align="left"><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
              <p align="left">                When you visit our Web site you may provide us with two types  of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is  collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on an  aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</strong></p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Registration Information:</strong><br>
                You will provide us information about yourself when you register to become a member of  Quit Your Day Job, register for certain services, or register for  email newsletters and alerts.</p>
              <p align="left">When you sign-up for our newsletter we collect your name and e-mail address. This is used for our own internal purposes and is not shared with any third party.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Agents</strong></p>
              <p align="left">We use an outside billing company (ClickBank - <a href="http://www.clickbank.com" target="_blank">www.clickbank.com</a>)  to process credit card orders and bill you for goods and services purchased through our website. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. </p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
              <p align="left">We use Aweber (<a href="http://www.aweber.com" target="_blank">www.aweber.com</a>) to handle all of our e-mail auto-responders and newsletter sign-ups. When you sign-up for our newsletter, we share your e-mail and name with Aweber as necessary for Aweber to provide this service. This information is not used for any other purpose. </p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Email Information:</strong><br>
                If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may  retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and  our responses. </p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Bulletin Boards/Forums:</strong></p>
              <p align="left">Once you have purchased one of our products or services you may have access to our exclusive members-only forums. If you decide to use the forums on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
              <p align="left">Any member of the forum who sends unsolicited messages to other members may be permanently removed from our forums. If you have received an unsolicited message from any member of the forum, please let us know by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:info@quityourdayjob.com">info@quityourdayjob.com</a>. </p>
              <p align="left"><strong>2. Web Site Usage Information:</strong><br>
                Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a  standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below,  "What Are Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about  how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server  logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at  our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web  site.&nbsp; We, our advertisers and ad serving  companies may also use small pieces of code called “clear  gifs” to determine which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how  users responded to them.</p>
              <p align="left">Some of our business partners; including advertisers, and web analytics providers use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
              <p align="left">This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.quityourdayjob.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to  Us?</strong><br>
                Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of  administering and expanding our business activities, providing customer service  and making available other products and services to our customers and  prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect  to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special  offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do  not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@quityourdayjob.com">info@quityourdayjob.com</a></p>
              <p align="left"><strong>What  Are Cookies?</strong><br>
                A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes  an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer  asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard  drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own  cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect  your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has  already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>How Do We Use Information We Collect from  Cookies?</strong><br>
                As you shop on our Web site, the site uses its cookies to  differentiate you from other shoppers so your shopping cart is only available  to you. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing  unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary  for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us  to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which  parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to  constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. Cookies do not  allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally  store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Sharing Information with Third Parties</strong><br>
                We will not sell or share your personally identifiable information with any third party.              </p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Notice of New Services and Changes</strong><br>
                Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to  notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special  offers we think you will find valuable. As our customer, you will be given the  opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by sending  us an email request at <a href="mailto:info@quityourdayjob.com">info@quityourdayjob.com</a> </p>
              <h3 align="left">Choice/Opt-out</h3>
              <p align="left">We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.</p>
              <p align="left">If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@quityourdayjob.com">unsubscribe@quityourdayjob.com</a>.</p>
              <p align="left">You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.   </p>
              <h3 align="left"><strong>How  Do We Protect Your Information?</strong></h3>
              <p align="left"><strong>Security</strong></p>
              <p align="left">We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
              <p align="left">If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@quityourdayjob.com">info@quityourdayjob.com</a>. </p>
              <p align="left"><strong>How  Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</strong><br>
                Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this  reason, we request that you do not send private information to us by email.  </p>
              <p align="left"><strong>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</strong><br>
                You may request access to all your personally identifiable  information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing <a href="mailto:info@quityourdayjob.com">info@quityourdayjob.com</a>. You can also change any of your subscription options by following the directions in any of our newsletters. </p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Certain Disclosures<br>
              </strong>We may disclosure your personal information if required to do  so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a)  conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us or Affiliated  Parties; (b) protect and defend our rights&nbsp;  and property, the Site, the users of the Site, and/or our Affiliated  Parties; (c) act under circumstances to protect the safety of users of the  Site, us, or third parties.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web  Site?</strong><br>
                We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites  linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained  therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to  information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.</p>
              <p align="left">                Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web  site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your  browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites which have  a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies.  Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Your Consent</strong><br>
                By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of  your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our  privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site to  keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what  circumstances we may disclose it.</p>
