## Safety and security

We use information about you to increase the safety and security of our Websites and Services. For example for verifying your account, detecting fraudulent activities and anything else that would make our Services more secure.

## Service providers and third parties

We work with third-party service providers for various tasks within our organization, including billing, marketing, customer support, analysis, accounting and others. If we transfer your personal data to a service provider in order to fulfill a task, we will make sure that the service provider only processes the data based on our instructions and by guaranteeing the same safeguards as we do. On top of that we guarantee that we have signed a data processing agreement with every service provider that makes sure that the partner is bound to the strict rules under the GDPR law. We have created a [separate list of all our subprocessors](https://www.quintly.com/subprocessors?hsLang=en), so that you can clearly see who we share your data with.

## Affiliated companies and change of ownership

We may share information about you with other quintly affiliates, including quintly Inc (US), quintly LLC (US) and quintly GmbH (DE), in order to operate the Websites and Services. Any data transfer in this regard is guaranteed to be in line with the GDPR regulation. We may also share information under this Policy in the case of any merger, sale, financing or acquisition of a part or the whole of any Quintly business. We will notify you accordingly in case this situation should arise.

## Law enforcement and compliance

We will share your information with a third-party (including law enforcement authorities) if we believe that sharing is necessary to comply with any applicable law or governmental requests.

## Non-personal information

In rare cases we may share non-personal data, such as aggregated information, with third-parties, including for reporting obligations and business/marketing purposes.

We use robust and state-of-the-art [technical and organizational measures](https://www.quintly.com/technical-organizational-measures?hsLang=en) to secure the data that we have about you. For more details you can find our separate document on technical and organizational measures here. We are reviewing our data protection processes regularly in order to make sure that we protect your data in the best possible way. If we use sub contractors and service providers to fulfill a specific task based on your data, we will make sure that the partner has similar state-of-the-art data protection processes in place.

We store your data only for as long as we need access to it in order to fulfill the purpose of the specific data processing activity. As the data retention period is different from use case to use case we have created a separate document with all our [processing activities](https://www.quintly.com/processing-activities?hsLang=en), in which you can find the exact period for each of the processing activities that we perform. On top of that and where possible we have applied a general rule inside Quintly that all personal data should be deleted or anonymized if you haven't been using our Websites and Services for more than 9 months. Exceptions to this rules only apply if there are technical limitations to guarantee this or where specific laws expect from us that we store the data for a longer time (e.g., requirements from tax authorities for storing documents).

We respect that your personal data is yours and therefore give you full control to decide what happens with your personal data.

## Access, correction and deletion

You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of it, to request the deletion of your information or to get it in a machine-readable electronic format. Many of these activities you can do yourself within our Services by navigating to the account settings page. For any other request please send us an email to [dataprivacy@quintly.com](mailto:dataprivacy@quintly.com) and we will do our best to give you a meaningful response as soon as possible after we have verified your identity. In some cases we may be limited in providing information to you, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about any other individual or if we are permitted by law or legitimate interest to keep it. Should you at any point believe that we didn't respect your data privacy rights, you can complain with the corresponding authorities.

## Opting out for specific use cases

You may opt-out of specific processing activities by using different methods, such as

  * Blocking cookies in your browser
  * Switching the settings in our cookie consent solution (Websites and Services)
  * Installing third-party browser extensions to block certain scripts (e.g., [Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout))
  * Clicking on unsubscribe links in marketing email that we sent



In many cases we use sub contractors, service providers and quintly affiliates that are based outside of the European Union. Should this be the case, we will always make sure that safeguards apply so that the corresponding data transfer is handled in line with the GDPR regulations. For sub processors in the US we rely on the EU/US Privacy Shield framework and signed data processing agreements that make sure that your data is secure. We have created a separate list of all processing activities that include all used sub contractors, their country of origin and the corresponding safeguards.
