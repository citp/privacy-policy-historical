## What Do we do with your Data?

We use data collected by us, directly and indirectly, as may be necessary to operate our ticketing platform and in order to provide ticketing services, or data collected by us with the user’s consent. Data is also used to ensure our website functions properly, and in order to optimise and improve our service offering. 

Event information submitted by Organisers will be publicly available on the website. Organisers are responsible for the information submitted by them and acknowledge that this information will be displayed publicly. 

We will share Buyers’ names, contact and ticket information, with the relevant Organisers pursuant to a ticket purchase only insofar as is necessary so that Organisers can monitor who is attending an event. Organisers are not bound to treat data in accordance with this privacy policy. Users agree that Quicket is not responsible for the actions of these Organisers with respect to your data. It is important that you review the applicable policies of the Organisers of an event before providing personal data or other information in connection with that event. 

We may contact users directly or through a third-party service provider regarding products or services a user has signed up for or purchased from us, such as may be necessary to deliver transactional or service related communications. Quicket may also contact you with offers for additional services we think you'll find valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed based upon legitimate interests. 

We may share personal data with trusted third parties as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as processing credit card payments. We only share personal data as necessary for any third party to provide the services as requested or as needed on our behalf. These third parties (and any subcontractors) are subject to strict data processing terms and conditions and are prohibited from utilising, sharing or retaining your personal data for any other purpose than as they have been specifically contracted for (or without your consent). We will share transaction data with our payment service providers or bank only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing payments, refunding payments, transferring money to a user, and/or dealing with user queries and complaints relating to such payments, refunds and transfers. 

The hosting, analytics, email sending and other technical provisions for our website and mobile app may be hosted on servers outside of South Africa or outside of the European Union. However, Quicket shall ensure that its host providers are subject to laws, or policies, which uphold principles for the reasonable processing of information substantially similar to the data protection laws applicable to the European Union and/or in South Africa to ensure adequate protection of any such data. 

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process, to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. 

We use analytics tools provided by service partners such as Google Analytics to collect information about how users interact with our website, including what pages you visit, what site you visited prior to visiting our website, how much time you spend on each page, what operating system and web browser you use and network and IP information. We use the information provided by these tools to improve our service offering. These tools place persistent cookies in a user’s browser to identify the user the next time a user visits our website. Each cookie cannot be used by anyone other than the service provider (e.g. Google for Google Analytics). The information collected from the cookie may be transmitted to and stored by these service partners on servers in a country other than the country in which you reside. You can control the technologies we use by managing your settings through the “cookie banners” that may be presented when you first visit our web pages, or by utilising settings in your browser or third-party tools. Refusing or deleting some cookies may make it impossible for us to provide our services to you. 

Our website may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third-party sites. Please read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
