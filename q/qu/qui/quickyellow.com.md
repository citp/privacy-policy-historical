### Collection of information

Information is collected primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. 

IDC Networks, Inc [IDC] mostly collects anonymous information through QuickYellow and other websites it operates. For instance, we may collect information to tell us that five thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or their date of birth - they are 'anonymous' to us.

### Use of anonymous information

We only use such data in an aggregate way. This collective data helps us determine how much our audiences use parts of the site, so we can improve our services. IDC may publish or provide this aggregate data to other people.
