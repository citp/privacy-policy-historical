Intuit Small Business Privacy Statement

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?ctv_group=IntuitSMB&companyName=Intuit&sealid=101 "TRUSTe")

At Intuit, we value our relationship with you and place the highest importance on respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers. To help you feel comfortable and confident when using our Web sites, here are the principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web sites. When we use the words "personal information," we're referring to information that personally identifies you. This privacy statement applies to all Intuit Small Business sites and services that display or link to the statement. 

Purchase and Registration:

When you purchase or download a product or service, we will ask you for information, such as your name, address, and telephone number, to help us validate your payment information. You can create an Intuit "My Account" to store your contact, billing, shipping, and payment information. That way, you won't have to enter it each time you make a purchase. When you open your account, we'll ask you to create user credentials consisting of a user ID and password and select a security question and answer. These user credentials can be used for other Intuit online services that require login. Your "My Account" information is stored on our protected servers. 

Some Intuit financial software requires you to register your purchase. During the registration process we ask for your name, business address and phone number, e-mail address and company name. We'll also ask for information about the product you purchased, such as its license number and version description. When you register online, we may automatically collect this license and version information. You must also enter contact information on the Web site or over the phone. We don't take personal information directly from the product without your consent. We may also ask you to answer some general questions about yourself and your business and how you use the product, but answering them is optional. In addition, we may also invite you- to participate in a study to track how you use our product. If you choose to participate, you can cancel your participation at any time. We may obtain additional information about you, such as demographic information, from commercially available sources. 

Intuit financial software products are Web-enabled, which allows us to deliver products, services and information through the Internet. Some features require Internet access and will open in a browser window in the software, which will pass through an Intuit server before being redirected onto the Internet. If the software cannot find a connection, it may ask you to establish one. 

When you use our products to access the Internet, we will store the message that took you there and its location in the product. If you click on a link to our support site from within the product, we may also collect information about your product, system or other technical data. This helps us give you the most appropriate information to solve your problem. If you connect to the Internet to use online features in our software, we may also include product updates such as software updates, service information and help content in Internet transmissions. We do not track Web site addresses, or URLs, that you type into your browser, nor do we track your Internet activity after you leave our Web sites. 

We work year-round to improve our products and services. From time to time, we place updates on our Web site for customers to download. These updates might include a timesaving new feature, minor repairs to keep software running smoothly, or timely information relevant to customers' businesses. In some cases, you may be able to have the software check for Automatic Updates. If you agree to use it, this feature will automatically check for updates when you are connected to our servers. You can always turn this feature off and manually download updates from our Web site. When you receive updates, Intuit will receive technical information about your computer's connection and the software being updated. A secure connection protects customer-sensitive information during an update. The Automatic Update feature is only used to update your software and some services to which you have subscribed. 

Our professional accounting products may offer the ability to electronically file tax returns to the IRS and state governments. Some of our professional accounting products require you to obtain authorization to process different types of tax returns. We will collect information to identify unique returns to ensure proper billing. In addition, you may be able to download financial information directly into some of our professional products, which may require you or your client to provide authentication information such as a client's user name, account number or password. As an approved transmitter of electronically filed federal income tax returns, we follow stringent security guidelines to help protect your data. Electronically filed tax returns are encrypted during transmission to us. We use secure connections to transmit your clients' tax returns to the IRS and to state tax filing agencies. We maintain copies of electronically filed returns in case we need to retransmit them to the appropriate service centers or to resolve technical support issues, billing, and for internal administrative purposes. 

Disclosing Your Data

Intuit may also transfer personal data to Intuit-affiliated companies in other countries. These may be outside the European Economic Area and may not have adequate laws that protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data. Where this is done, Intuit shall take necessary steps to adequately protect the information transferred. BY SUPPLYING PERSONAL DATA TO INTUIT, YOU CONSENT TO ANY SUCH TRANSFER.

This information is encrypted and transmitted using secure socket layer technology, making it is unreadable during transmission. It is then stored on our secure servers.

Whenever we ask for sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, we encrypt it as it is transmitted to us.

Additionally, we use internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security procedures.

How to Protect Your Personal Information

Here are ways to protect your personal information when using the Internet and online services: 

  * Use a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to your computer.
  * Use a virus-checking program and keep it up to date. 
  * Keep your operating system and programs up to date.
  * Close all active programs and logoff before leaving a computer that you share with others. 
  * Restrict all other folders or directories to "no share" if you use file-sharing programs. 
  * Choose a user ID that is different from government documents, such as a Social Security or driver's license number. Also do not use your birthdate or some other date or word that is either easy to guess.
  * Choose a strong password using a combination of letters, numbers and special characters that are meaningful to you and yet not easily guessed by someone else. Keep your password private.
  * Do not trust e-mail requests for personal information. On Web sites, look for the lock symbol, which signifies a secure site before supplying personal information. If in doubt, ask.
  * When using open Internet chat and forum services, do not supply personal or financial information or more information than necessary to define your problem. 
  * Read privacy statements to learn how your information will be collected and used. 



At Intuit, safeguarding your personal information is a top priority. Part of that commitment is making you aware of popular identity theft and fraud scams and providing you with information to protect yourself. 

Although they may be difficult to identify, you may receive hoax e-mails, such as phishing scams, that look authentic and appear to have been sent by a company you recognize. These e-mails ask you to provide or confirm your sensitive personal information by clicking on links. To entice you, they often claim an urgent or threatening condition concerning your account, or offer you a prize. 

You should not reply or click on any links in the e-mail or provide any personal information without verifying that the e-mail is legitimate through another channel. Intuit does not solicit sensitive customer information via e-mail. If you receive an e-mail message that appears to come from us that requests such information, please forward it immediately to: [security@intuit.com](mailto:security@intuit.com).

Third Parties

Sometimes, we ask outside firms, or third parties, to help us provide services, such as designing a Web site, sending e-mails, registering a prospective domain name, or analyzing data. Our contracts with these third parties outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit them from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service they're providing. We require vendors to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them. 

We may disclose, access, or report personal information when we believe, in good faith, we're required to by law or to protect our legal rights. We may also do this in connection with an investigation into a suspected violation involving the Terms of Service, fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other activity that may be illegal or expose us to legal liability. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities or to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request. 

We may report and share information about your account to credit bureaus, consumer reporting agencies and card associations. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report and consumer report. We may also share information with other companies, lawyers, credit bureaus, agents, government agencies and card associations in connection with issues related to fraud, credit or debt collection.

We also may share non-identifiable, non-personal aggregate information about our users with third parties, such as advertisers or partners, for marketing and promotional purposes. Our Web sites may provide links to third-party sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. These could include other services, promotions or sweepstakes offered by business partners.

If you are no longer interested in receiving program information from Intuit, you may ask that your Intuit account representative remove you from future program-specific communications. 

If we sell, merge or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your personal information. If so, you will be asked if you'd like to stop receiving promotional information following any change of control. 

We may use sources outside of Intuit to supplement the information you give us. For example, we may validate your address using other sources. We use this data to help us maintain accuracy and provide you with better service. 

Intuit and its subsidiaries may exchange information about your transactions to fulfill your requests. We may also provide you information about products or services we believe you may be interested in unless you have asked us not to contact you. We offer you the opportunity to review privacy practices at our subsidiaries' Web sites. 

We provide discussion forums, blogs and other community-oriented features that enable forum members to communicate with other members.
