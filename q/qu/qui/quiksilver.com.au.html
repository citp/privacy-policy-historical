Because we gather certain types of information about and from you, our users and subscribers, in order to fulfill your requests and better serve your needs, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of this information. This Privacy Policy discloses what information we gather, how we use it, how to correct or change it, and what steps we take to safeguard personal information provided to us both online and offline. Quiksilver’s Australian entities are subject to the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and Quiksilver’s New Zealand entities are subject to the Privacy Act 1993.  Please read the complete Privacy Policy below, as well as our Terms of Use, and contact us if you have any questions.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>What Information Do We Collect About You?</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">You can visit the Website (“the Website”), read articles and other materials, browse merchandise and check on offerings without giving us any personally identifiable information. However, in order to provide users and subscribers with the most efficient and enhanced personalized service and attention, we may request information about you in certain circumstances and collect certain information automatically. We also use contact lists and other information which are obtained from third parties. For the convenience of all of our customers and to better serve you, we create and maintain a customer account that includes all the collected personal information we may have with respect to an individual. Nevertheless, you can update or correct your contact information or change your preferences about receiving offers and information from us at any time, including changing your preferences about sharing information with third parties.  </span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>Information You Volunteer</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">We collect personally identifiable information that you volunteer to us (such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, age, gender, hobbies, family information and/or similar demographic information), when you subscribe to, or create an account with, the Website, (see the section below for more information on subscriptions and account management), enter a competition through the Website, request a catalogue, place an order (if applicable) or voluntarily register on the Website. Often this additional information is optional or requested anonymously in connection with a survey. Website visitors may register to receive our e-mail updates, or enter online competitions. Registration may also be required to participate in certain message boards, bulletin boards, chat rooms or surveys available on the Website. Sometimes registration can be accomplished by submitting only a user name and password. Other offerings may require the submission of additional information. For example, the Website may ask which disciplines you enjoy most, surfing, skating or snowboarding. Registration forms will indicate what information is required and what information (if any) is optional. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>Information Collected Automatically</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">We may also automatically collect your IP and referring Website addresses, browser type, domain name and Website access times. This information helps facilitate your online experience on the Website. In addition, we use cookies to track usage patterns on the Website and to control the display of ads, as well as to offer other functionalities (such as screening for age, helping to track items in your shopping basket if the Website offers online shopping opportunities, and "recognizing" you to speed up your log-in when you visit the Website). You can turn off cookies, but that will affect your online experience and you may not be able to complete an order or transaction.  Please see below for more detail on cookies. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>Other Information</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">We conduct market research so that we can continually improve our brands and Website and may purchase or rent lists of potential subscribers or customers from third parties. Those lists may include information on current subscribers or customers. This information may be included in our database in order to help us serve you better by, for example, minimizing multiple mailings and e-mailings and providing information tailored to your interests.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b></b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>What Do We Do With Collected Information?</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">We use information you provide to fulfill your requests and improve the Website, our products and services. We may, from time to time, share personal information with related companies related to Quiksilver Australia.  Some of these companies may be located outside Australia however Quiksilver adheres to the National Privacy Principles set out in Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) in relation to the transfer of personal information to non-Australian entities to all personal information.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">We may, from time to time, produce reports for advertisers, sponsors and vendors containing anonymous, aggregate information about our users and subscribers, such as demographic, age and online usage information. This information allows us to provide content and offers that are most relevant to our subscribers and users and to work more closely with advertisers. We do not include any personally identifiable information of our users in these reports.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">We use personal information so that we may display or send custom, personalized content to the Website visitors and send newsletters, mail, e-mails, features, promotional material, surveys and other updates, information or offers to our users and subscribers. From time to time, we may also establish business relationships with other persons or entities that we believe to be trustworthy and whose privacy policies are generally consistent with our privacy policy (“Choice Partners”).  In such cases we might share and cross-reference information, including personal information about you that will enable our Choice Partners to contact you regarding products and services that you might find of interest. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">To serve you better, we may also combine information you give us online, in our stores or through our catalogs. We may also combine that information with publicly available information and information which we receive from our Choice Partners or other third parties. We use the total mix of information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes as we determine from time to time.  </span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our products and services, fulfill customer requests, announce competition winners, respond to any future problems, such as difficulties in navigating the Website or accessing certain features, and to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with users.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">We allow users of the Website to send articles or links by e-mail to other parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any e-mail addresses (unless you are a member who has already voluntarily provided your e-mail address) of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they are sent, and we do not share "send a friend" e-mail addresses with third parties. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">Of course, we use personal information to allow you to subscribe online, and, if product orders are available on the Website, to make such orders. We and our technical and fulfillment agents, partners and consultants follow carefully proscribed procedures to safeguard credit card data in connection with your transactions and adhere to certain legal requirements.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>How Do We Share Personal Information?</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">Personal information is available to Quiksilver and the technical and fulfillment agents, partners and consultants who make the Website, products and services available to you. Anonymous information is available to our advertisers, sponsors and promotional and business partners. We share your personal information with third parties only as described below.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>Quiksilver and Its Agents</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">Quiksilver may access anonymous, aggregate demographic data and any personal information you provide for internal marketing purposes, including sending you notices of competition winners, new websites, services or products we offer and any other orders. To facilitate product orders (if they are available on the Wesbite), Quiksilver will cache your order information, and create an authorization with a merchant account (e.g., your credit card company). Website hosting firms, technical and database consultants, advertising agencies, order processing partners, customer service partners and fulfillment firms, including firms assisting us in offering competitions and promotions, may have access to personally identifiable information in the course of making our products and services available. All companies working for and with Quiksilver must comply with our privacy policy, and are not permitted to sell your information to third parties or to use it except as authorized by us and you, or as permitted or required by law.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>Participating Vendors</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">The Website may offer opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors. On Websites with these online purchase opportunities, we will also give participating manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers or distributors the order information and authorization for the merchant bank. Any time you order from a participating vendor, that vendor will automatically have all the information related to the order. Participating vendors have their own privacy polices, and they may use that information to advise you directly of other products and offerings that they provide. Quiksilver is not responsible for these third parties' respective privacy policies, and we urge you to inquire about their information collection and use practices. In addition, all vendors will receive the same anonymous, aggregate data that our advertisers receive.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>Credit Card Companies</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">As in any transaction, your credit card company will have all relevant information about the name of the vendor, item(s) purchased, date, total cost and other information necessary to process the transaction. Quiksilver will not otherwise provide any personal data to your credit card company without your permission.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>Advertisers, Sponsors and Promotional and Business Partners</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">We share anonymous, aggregate demographic information (such as gender, age, income, hobbies, interests, etc.), and anonymous information obtained from cookies and similar technologies, with our advertisers, sponsors, promotional and business partners, and participating vendors. No personally identifiable information is disclosed to any of these third parties in providing these reports. Credit card numbers, bank account numbers and passwords are not shared with advertisers, sponsors or promotional partners, and are only shared with the specific vendors with whom you place an online order (if product orders are available on the Website).</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">Information which we obtain in non-Internet transactions or competitions is handled differently. We may share offline contact information with third parties, who may send you offers or information about their products or services. You must opt-out if you do not wish to receive information from third parties or us by mail.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">Your e-mail address is not shared with third parties unless you agree to receive information, by opting-in, from third parties. In other words, we may extend e-mail offers to users or subscribers on behalf of our business partners about a particular product or service that may be of interest to you, but only if you have indicated that you would like to receive these offers. If you wish to receive such offers, we will not share or disclose your name or e-mail address to those business partners, but will send you the information or offers on their behalf. As a result, although Quiksilver may receive a fee from our business partners for this service, Quiksilver sends the offers so that your personal information is never shared with any outside third party. Of course, you may opt out of receiving these offers at any time.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">Sometimes we will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive e-mail offers from third parties not affiliated with Quiksilver.  If you decide to accept these offers, we will provide, with your consent, your contact information to the third party. On the Website, visitors will also have opportunities to sign up directly with certain advertisers and sponsors to enter competitions or to receive e-mail updates and other information directly from them. Third party vendors and advertisers will also use technical and other consultants. We urge visitors to review carefully the privacy policies of these firms. Quiksilver is not responsible for the privacy policies and procedures of any third party.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through Quiksilver's Website or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others. For example, if you use chat, forums, bulletin boards, blogs or message boards, or if you post personal information online (such as your e-mail address), you may receive unsolicited messages from others. Quiksilver has no control over this use of your personal information.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>Important Note</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent for the following purposes: as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of the Website and our property; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>How Do We Use Cookies?</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">Your Web browser offers so-called "cookies" which, if you allow their use, store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a Website. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally. However, cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best and make it easier to use our sites. We use a cookie in order to retain the contents of your shopping cart while you browse the site. Cookies also enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser.

These images allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We also may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about the Website usage. Web beacons collect only a limited range of information, including the time and date of page view, cookie number and description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Some of our Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by our advertising partners to help us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>What About Third Party Advertisers?</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">Some of the third party content displayed in the Website is provided by outside companies.

Unlike cookies and Web beacons used by Quiksilver in content we control on the Website, we do not have access to information collected from cookies or Web beacons received in connection with third party content. While we use third parties which we believe are reputable to serve some or all of the content placed within the Website, third parties may use information (not including personally identifiable information) about your visits to the Website and other Websites to assist in serving their third party content to you. They may also share anonymous information with their clients such as date/time of the content shown, the specific content shown, the IP address and other similar information.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font"><b>How Can You Control Your Personal Information?</b></span></p><p><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:11px;" class="font">We believe that choice in how and when you are contacted is the key to customer satisfaction.
