Cookies are packets of information sent to your web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses the server that sent the cookie.

A pixel tag (also known as “action tag” and “web beacon”) is a 1X1 pixels transparent object which is embedded in a web page to enable the display of optimized content and advertisements to end users.

The use of these technologies by these advertising services is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We require our Ad-Serving Providers to include on the ads a link to information about their privacy practices and how to opt-out of their services. At any time, you may contact us at: info@quicklypopular.com and we will assist you in locating the Ad-Serving Providers’ privacy related information.
