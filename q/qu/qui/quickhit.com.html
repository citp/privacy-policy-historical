<p>YOUR USE OF THE QUICK HIT SITES AND SERVICES IS SUBJECT TO YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
<p>This Web site is operated by, and information collected from this site is collected by, Quick Hit, Inc. ("<strong>Quick Hit</strong>," the "<strong>Company</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>").</p>
<p>Quick Hit respects the privacy of its online visitors and users of its products and services. Quick Hit recognizes the importance of protecting certain information collected from users and has adopted this Privacy Policy that guides how Quick Hit gathers, stores, and uses information provided from users through the Quick Hit Sites and Services as described below. </p>
<p>This policy is current as of its last revision date indicated above. However, please note that this policy may be amended from time to time to reflect changes and additions to the Privacy Policy. Please check back for the most current version before relying on any of the provisions in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://www.quickhit.com" title="www.quickhit.com">www.quickhit.com</a>, <a href="http://www.playhardsports.com" title="www.playhardsports.com">www.playhardsports.com</a>, <a href="http://www.playhard.net" title="www.playhard.net">www.playhard.net</a> and all other web sites owned, operated, licensed or controlled by Quick Hit (including the related online products and services, the "<strong>Quick Hit Sites and Services</strong>"), unless such sites contain or link to a separate Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Collection and Use of Information</strong></p>
<p>By using the Quick Hit Sites and Services, users agree that Quick Hit may share with other parties aggregate information and non-identifiable information gathered by Quick Hit in the course of your use of the Quick Hit Sites and Services. "<strong>Aggregate information</strong>" is information that describes the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of users as a group but does not describe or reveal the identity of any particular user. "<strong>Non-identifiable information</strong>" is information about a user that is presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to other users but not in a form that personally identifies contact and/or billing information for any user, or enables the recipient to communicate directly with any user unless agreed to by the user in advance of such communication. Aggregate information and/or non-identifiable information may be used by Quick Hit for any purpose, including, without limitation, to improve the Quick Hit Sites and Services, for internal marketing studies, or simply to collect demographic information about Quick Hit’s users. </p>
<p>Quick Hit may use contact information provided by users to send information about Quick Hit and the Quick Hit Sites and Services for which you subscribed or otherwise used or accessed, including, without limitation, news about product updates, contests, events, and other promotional materials, and only if the users agree to receive such communications, for unrelated products or services. </p>
<p>"<strong>Personally-identifiable information</strong>" is information that permits a recipient to identify you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, or credit card information. While Quick Hit collects personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis for the use of the Quick Hit Sites and Services, Quick Hit’s collection of personally-identifiable information may be a requirement for access to certain parts of the Quick Hit Sites or Services. We may collect personally-identifiable information from you in a variety of ways, including when you (a) make an online purchase from the Quick Hit Sites, (b) register to become a member or user of the Quick Hit Sites and Services, (c) voluntarily provide it when you use the Quick Hit Site and Services, (d) disclose it in a public area of the Quick Hit Site and Services, or (e) provide it when you communicate with us.<br>
Quick Hit may use the personally-identifiable information that you provide in connection with such purchase for shipping and billing purposes, to administer and manage your account, or provide promotional updates regarding such Quick Hit Sites and Services as contemplated above. In addition, we may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical or security issues related to the Quick Hit Sites and Services you requested, confirming you requested a product or service, or providing periodic updates or information relating to the Quick Hit Sites and Services you requested. For so long as you are subscribed to or otherwise using or accessing a Quick Hit Site or Service, you will not be able to choose to unsubscribe from these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the product or service you have chosen.</p>
<p>Except in the cases described below, Quick Hit will not share personally- identifiable information with any third-party unless the user agrees to such disclosure in advance.</p>
<p>Quick Hit may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including, without limitation, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail, providing billing and collection services, conducting customer surveys, and processing event registration. We will only provide to these companies the information reasonably required to perform the applicable service, and they will be prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. When these companies collect and/or have access to the personally-identifiable information you provide, we require that they protect the confidentiality of personally-identifiable information they collect or have access to in the course of their engagement by Quick Hit.</p>
<p>Also, in certain cases, your personally-identifiable information may be collected directly by our authorized distributors, sub-licensees or subcontractors in connection with certain products or services made available through Web sites operated by such companies. In these cases, the privacy policies of such companies will apply rather than Quick Hit’s policy. If providing the information is a requirement of usage, the user may elect to decline to use that particular product or service. </p>
<p>Quick Hit may elect to share personally-identifiable information of users with certain business partners for marketing or other similar purposes but only if the users agree to share such information. In such event, such partners will be prohibited from disclosing such information or using such information except for the limited purposes for which such users agree to share such information. </p>
<p>Furthermore, third-party web sites and companies with links to and from the Quick Hit Sites and Services may collect personally-identifiable information about users. You should be aware that these third-party web sites or links may have their own information collection practices and privacy policies. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties that have Web sites linked to the Quick Hit Sites and Services. If you click on a third-party advertisement or link, the privacy policies of the third-party web site that you link to will govern the use of your information by that Web site's operator. Quick Hit’s Privacy Policy does not extend to these external Web sites and companies. Please refer directly to these companies and Web sites regarding their privacy policies. We assume no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise. Accordingly, please make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third-party Web sites to which you follow a link. </p>
<p>Quick Hit may disclose your personally identifiable-information or otherwise use such information to communicate with you if required or permitted to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process or any governmental request; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Quick Hit or its affiliated companies, licensors or licensees; (c) enforce the Terms of Service or any applicable License Agreements; or (d) protect the personal safety or interests of Quick Hit employees, users of Quick Hit products or services, or members of the public in urgent circumstances. We also may disclose your personally-identifiable information to a third-party that alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights, subject to reasonable verification of such claims.<br>
In the event of a merger or consolidation of Quick Hit, or the sale of all or substantially all of its stock or assets, or the transfer of the operation and distribution of certain products or services to a third-party, or bankruptcy of Quick Hit, your personally identifiable information may be transferred to Quick Hit’s successor or assign resulting from such events.</p>
<p><strong>Children Under The Age of 13</strong></p>
<p>Once a child states that his/her age is under 13, we do not collect or store any personally-identifiable information such as name, address, or email address. We will disable the account of anyone discovered to be under 13 years of age and all content created by that account will be removed from our site.  We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when online. Teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to opt out of receiving communications from us or removing personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies and Other Information Stored on a User's Machine</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are bits of electronic information stored on a user's hard drive to provide information needed by the user on a regular basis. They are often used to save Web site customizations and Web site login information.</p>
<p>We use third-party media management tools and services to deliver ads on our behalf across the Internet. Such third parties may also collect anonymous information about your visits the Quick Hit Sites and Services. This is primarily accomplished through the use of anonymous cookies, and a technology device, commonly referred to as a Web Beacon or Action Tag, which we place on various pages within the Quick Hit Sites and Services and other online content or in emails, that allow such third parties to collect anonymous information. Such third parties may use information about your visits to the Quick Hit Sites and Services and other Web sites in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice, and your ability to opt-out of third-party cookies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Quick Hit may use clear gifs, frames, server log analysis, and other technology to customize your experience with the Quick Hit Sites and Services. We will handle personal information collected through the use of these technologies according to this Privacy Policy.<br>
An IP address is a number that uniquely identifies your computer on the Internet. We may collect IP addresses for the purposes of providing our products and services, including, without limitation, system administration, troubleshooting, user compliance with our Terms of Service, investigating security breaches, and compiling aggregate information (such as how many visitors logged on to the Quick Hit Sites and Services). When you visit a particular web page on the Quick Hit Sites, our servers log your IP address. </p>
<p>Quick Hit stores information on our game servers that is used in conjunction with online play of Quick Hit products. For example, some user configuration settings for multi-player game play, including the player name input by the user, may be uploaded to the server for online play. The player name along with current game play stats is displayed to other users during multi-player game play or the related Quick Hit Sites. Users should be aware that this game play information disclosed during multi-player game play is public information. Quick Hit will not disclose a user's personally-identifiable information associated with such game play to other users except as permitted herein. </p>
<p><strong>Chat Rooms/Forums</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, Quick Hit may provide online chat (voice or text) rooms and/or forums to users. Any information that is disclosed in these chat rooms and forums is public information and users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in such chat rooms and forums. If you voluntarily disclose information in a public area of the Quick Hit Sites and Services, such as a voice or text chat room or forum, that information may be collected and used by a third-party to send you unsolicited messages, advertisements or for other purposes. We do not control the actions of these third parties in public areas of the Quick Hit Sites and Services, so if you disclose information in a public area, you do so <strong>at your own risk</strong>. Further, any communication (voice or chat) within any online game or any other communication feature within the Quick Hit Sites and Services (e.g. instant message services or voice), including without limitation, communications conducted "privately" with another person, go through Quick Hit’s servers and any such communications that you send or receive may be monitored by Quick Hit. </p>
<p><strong>Resumes</strong></p>
<p>Quick Hit may allow for the online submission of resumes via the Quick Hit corporate website. Please note that the information (including personal information) collected from a resume is not subject to this Privacy Policy. The information obtained from your resume will be used for the purpose of evaluating your submission for a job with Quick Hit.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, Quick Hit provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from Quick Hit when you are asked to provide information and the option of discontinuing receipt of communications from Quick Hit by removing your information from Quick Hit’s databases. Instructions for discontinuing receipt of communications from Quick Hit will be made available with the communication or on the related Quick Hit Site. </p>
<p><strong>Storage and Security of Information</strong></p>
<p>Personally-identifiable information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Quick Hit or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Quick Hit Sites and Services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Quick Hit will take reasonable steps to protect the information users share with us. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Corrections, Updates and Removal of Information</strong></p>
<p>If you are concerned about the accuracy of personally identifiable information maintained by Quick Hit or would like your personally identifiable information removed from Quick Hit’s records, you may use the tools, if any, made available with the particular Quick Hit Site or Service to update or remove such information or you may contact us by email or mail at the address set forth below. If you choose to delete your personally-identifiable information, you may not be able to access some areas of the Quick Hit Sites or Services to which you have subscribed. For your protection, you will be required to provide proof of your identity to obtain a copy of your personally-identifiable information. We will not provide a refund for any prepaid service which is inaccessible to you because of your deletion of personally-identifiable information. We may still retain your information in our files, however, to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreements, and due to technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our Web sites and Services.</p>
<p><strong>No Absolute Safeguards</strong></p>
<p>Although we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your information, transmissions on the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. Accordingly, we assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond our reasonable control.</p>
<p><strong>Your Role in Protecting Your Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Please remember that protection of your privacy begins with you. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any account ID or password you use to register, and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing information online.  The account ID and password you choose should be difficult for someone to guess and should not contain things like birthdays, names of family members, etc.  We caution you against giving out personally identifiable information to others online or in-game, as this information may be used for illegal or harmful purposes.  No legitimate Quick Hit representative will ever ask you for your password – do not provide it.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>If you use the Quick Hit Sites and Services, you are accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, and we will have the right to use your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to have your information used in any of the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue use of the Quick Hit Sites and Services. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Your continued use of the Quick Hit Sites and Services after we either personally notify you or generally post such changes on the Quick Hit Sites will constitute your acceptance of those changes.</p>
<p><strong>Other Agreements </strong></p>
<p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, your rights and obligations concerning the Quick Hit Sites and Services are governed by the applicable Terms of Service and End User License Agreement. Please review each such agreement carefully, as you must agree to be bound by each such agreement before you may use the Quick Hit Sites and Services.</p>
<p><strong>Language</strong></p>
<p>By consenting to this Privacy Policy, you confirm that your command and knowledge of English is sufficient to understand the terms and conditions set forth herein.</p>
<p><strong>Local Laws</strong></p>
<p>For persons in European Union countries, as used herein, terms such as "personal information" refer to "personal data" as defined by the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ("Directive"). Quick Hit will not collect any personal data from you unless you provide it voluntarily by providing Quick Hit with your freely-given specific and informed consent. By using Quick Hit Sites or Services, you agree that Quick Hit may transfer your personal information outside the European Union in connection with the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. Your personal data may be transferred to the United States (and/or other non-EU jurisdictions, as applicable).</p>
<p>In certain jurisdictions in which local law may be required to apply, some of the information collected by Quick Hit (or its designees) may be personal information and entitle you to the right to object to its collection and to the right to access and correct the collected information pertaining to you.</p>
