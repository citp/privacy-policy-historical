We at **Quiet Revolution LLC** (“Quiet Revolution,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) have created this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Quiet Revolution in connection with our Website. By visiting our Website, Visitors and Registered Users are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use.

Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use.

In the course of operating the Website, Quiet Revolution will collect (and/or receive) the following types of information. You authorize us to collect and/or receive such information.

**Personal Information**

When you sign up to become a Registered User, you will be required to provide us with personal information about yourself such as your name, phone number, and e-mail address. And if you contact us via the Contact Us page, you will need to provide your name and e-mail address.

From Cookies. We collect information using “cookie” technology. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Website. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Website may not function properly.

From You. You may voluntarily provide us additional information about yourself such as your gender, country, product and service preferences, and other information.

**The Information Collected By or Through Third-Party Advertising Companies**

You authorize us to share Other Information about your activity on the Website with third parties for the purpose of tailoring, analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing advertising you see on the Website and elsewhere. These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect such Other Information for such purposes. Pixel tags enable us, and these third-party advertisers, to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site.

**How We Use and Share the Information**

You authorize us to use the Personal Information and the Other Information (collectively, the “Information”) to provide and improve our Website, products, and services; to process transactions you request; to inform you about our products and services and those of our promotional partners; and to bring you customized content (such as newsletters) based on your activity on the Website.

**You also authorize us to use and/or share the Information as described below.**

We may share the Information concerning our Registered Users with our resellers, distributors, and sales representatives, which may use such Information to help inform Registered Users about our products and services.

We may, from time to time, share the Information with other companies, which may provide you information about the products and services they or their partners offer. However, to the extent required by law, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of such sharing.

We will access, use, and share the Information as required to fulfill our contractual obligations to you and to address your questions or requests regarding our products, services, and/or support.

We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing technical assistance, recruiting services, order fulfillment, customer service, and marketing assistance. These other companies will have access to the Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law.

In an ongoing effort to better understand our Visitors, Registered Users, Website, products, and services and those of our promotional partners, we may analyze certain Information in anonymized and aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Website and/or such products and services.

As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the Information may be part of the transferred assets.

To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose the Information: (i) when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency; or (ii) whenever we believe that disclosing such Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Quiet Revolution or others.

**Accessing and Modifying Information and Communication Preferences**

Registered Users may access, remove, review, and/or make changes to their Personal Information by contacting us through the Contact Page. In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any Quiet Revolution marketing e-mail.

**How We Protect the Information**

We take reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the Information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e mail sent to or from the Website may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.

**Important Notices to Non-U.S. Residents**

The Website and its servers are operated in the United States and elsewhere. Please be aware that your Information, including your Personal Information, may be transferred to, processed, maintained, and used on computers, servers, and systems located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to use the Website, you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to such transfer, processing, and use in the United States and elsewhere.

**External Websites**

The Website may contain links to third-party websites. Quiet Revolution has no control over the privacy practices or the content of these websites. As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those third-party websites. You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any other websites.

**Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)**

1. Overview 

Although the Platform is for general audiences and is not directed to children under the age of 13, we recognize that some of our users may be under the age of 13 and that their parents may wish for them to participate in all of the benefits we offer via the Platform.  Full participation in the Platform may require the collection and submission of Personal Information (as defined below).  Rather than restricting access to the Platform to those 13 years of age or older, Quiet Revolution has opted to make the Platform available to everyone.  In doing so, we desire to comply with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), which was established by Congress to protect children’s online privacy.  COPPA requires that operators of online services (such as ours) adhere to specific guidelines regarding the collection and handling of Personal Information about children under the age of 13.  For more information about COPPA and your child’s rights to online privacy, visit the [Children’s Privacy section of the FTC’s website.](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy)

COPPA requires, among other things, that we provide parents with certain information and obtain their consent prior to permitting children under the age of 13 to access and use the Platform.  This Privacy Policy describes our information practices for Personal Information collected online from all of our users, including those under the age of 13.  

2. Changing or Deleting Personal Information About Children Under 13

 At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to collect further Personal Information from their children under 13 and can request that any Personal Information that we have collected be deleted from our records.  To access, change, or delete the Personal Information that we have collected from their children under 13, parents can [contact us](http://www.quietrev.com/contact-us/).  Please include the children’s names and the parent’s email address so that we can better assist you with your inquiry or request.  

Before responding to any request to review Personal Information collected from children under 13, we may require that the requester follow reasonable procedures to help verify his or her identity as the child’s parent or legal guardian.  We may deny any request that fails to follow these procedures.  Please note that if you choose to have your child’s Personal Information deleted, or refuse to permit further collection or use of your child’s Personal Information, certain features of the Platform may be limited or unavailable.

3.  Additional Operators Collecting Personal Information on the Platform

COPPA requires that we list all third-party operators (e.g., ad companies, providers of plug-ins, etc.) that collect information through the Platform.  [Please click here ](http://www.quietrev.com/privacy-policy/providers/)to view the list of such operators.

**California Residents**

Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents who have an established business relationship with Quiet Revolution may choose to opt out of our sharing of their Personal Information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and (1) you wish to opt out or (2) you wish to request certain information regarding our disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties for the direct marketing purposes, please contact us through the Contact Page with “PRIVACY POLICY” in the subject line.

In addition, Quiet Revolution does not monitor, recognize, or honor any opt-out or do-not-track mechanisms, including general web browser “Do Not Track” settings and/or signals.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on the Website. By accessing the Website after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of the Information is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collect the Information. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.
