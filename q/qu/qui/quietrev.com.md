**The Information We Collect and/or Receive**

In the course of operating the Website, Quiet Revolution will collect (and/or receive) the following types of information. You authorize us to collect and/or receive such information.

  1. ******Information You Provide**



We collect information you provide directly via the Website, such as when you sign up to become a Registered User, take our quiz, request information on our workshops, or contact customer support. We may use Service Providers (defined below) to collect this information.

The information we collect includes information that identifies you personally (whether alone or in combination). Some examples of information we collect include the following:

  * **Contact Data.** We collect your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number and other similar contact data.
  * **Payment Data.** We collect data necessary to process your payment if you make a purchase, including your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument.
  * ****We collect the content of messages you send to us, such as essays or art that you submit for possible publication, or questions and information you provide to customer support via the Contact Quiet page. We also collect the content of your communications as necessary to provide you with the services you use or request.
  * **Workshop Attendance.** If you attend a Quiet Revolution event, there may be an opportunity to provide contact information and sign up to receive additional content or information about how to engage with Quiet Revolution.  You may opt-out of receiving future mailings as set forth in the “Your Rights and Choices” section below.
  * The Content posted on this Website is for general informational purposes only.  Therefore before you make any permitted use of such Content, you should modify it to comply with all rules and regulations of any institution which will make use of such Content and in any event to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws.



You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the Service that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information. 

  1. ******Information Collected Automatically**



We automatically collect information about your device and how your device interacts with our Websites. We may use Service Providers to collect this information.  Such information may include:

  * **Service Use Data From Your Activity**. In an ongoing effort to improve the Website, we automatically collect certain information when Visitors and Registered Users access and use the Website. Such information includes, without limitation, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Website users visit, log files, and similar information and data.
  * **Device Connectivity and Configuration Data**. We collect data about the type of device, the browser type and language you use, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, and other similar information.  This data also includes IP address, MAC address, device advertising ID (e.g., IDFA or AAID), and other device identifiers.
  * **Location Data**. We collect data about your device’s location, which can be precise (e.g., latitude/longitude data) or imprecise (e.g., location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level).



We use various current – and later – developed technologies to collect this information (“Tracking Technologies”), including the following:

  * ****We collect information using “cookie” technology. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect information and to enhance your experience using the Website. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Website may not function properly.
  * ****A pixel (also known as a web beacon) is code embedded in a website, video, e-mail, or advertisements that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, e-mail, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Website, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Website with your social media account.
  * **Log Files.** A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Website, such as your service use data.



Some information about your use of the Website and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Website and certain Third Party Services. For further information on Tracking Technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the sections entitled “Third Parties” and “Your Rights and Choices” below.

  1. ******Information from Other Sources.**



We also obtain information about you from third-party advertising companies.  To the extent we combine such third party sourced information with information we have collected about you through the Website, we will treat the combined information in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. These third party sources  vary over time, but have included:

  * Social networks when you reference our Service or grant permission to Company to access your data on one or more of these services.
  * Partners with which we offer co-branded services, sell or distribute our products, or engage in joint marketing activities.

**Third Parties**

  1. ** Third Party Services.**

The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Website, a Third Party Service, a Third Party Feature (defined below), or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. Quiet Revolution has no control over the privacy practices or the content of these Third Party Services. As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those Third Party Services. You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any other websites.

  1. ** Third Party Features.**



We may allow you to connect our Website to a Third Party Service or offer our Service through a Third Party Service (“Third Party Features”). If you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature, and you should carefully review the third party’s privacy policy and terms of use. Some examples of Third Party Features include the following:

  * **Liking, Sharing, and Logging-In**. We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Website that allows you to “like” or “share” content on, or log-in to your account through Third Party Services, including social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. If you choose to engage with such a Third Party Service through our Website, we may collect any information you have authorized the Third Party Service to share with us (such as your user ID, billing information, public profile information, e-mail address, birthday, friends list, and other account and profile data). Likewise, if you choose to engage with such a Third Party Service through our Website or visit our Website while logged in to that Third Party Service on your device, the Third Party Service may receive information about your activities on our Website and be able to associate that information with information the Third Party Service already has about you.


  * **Brand Pages.** We offer our content on social networks such as a Facebook and Twitter. Any information you provide to us when you engage with our content (such as through our brand page) is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

  1. ** Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.**



Our Website contains Tracking Technologies owned and operated by Third Parties. For example, we use Tracking Technologies from third party analytics provides, such as Google Analytics, to help us analyze your use of the Website, compile statistic reports on the Website’s activity, and provide us with other services relating to Website activity and internet usage. We also work with ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on Third Party Services. You authorize us to share information about your activity on the Website with third parties for the purpose of tailoring, analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing advertising you see on the Website and elsewhere.

We may serve ads on and through Third Party Services, such as Facebook and Google, that are targeted to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our Website or are identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by us uploading a customer list to the Third Party Service or incorporating a pixel from the Third Party Service on our Website, and the Third Party Service matching common factors between our data and their data. To opt-out of receiving Matched Ads, please contact the applicable Third Party Service. If we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve Matched Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such Facebook ads and find out how to opt-out. We are not responsible for such Third Party Service’s failure to comply with your opt-out instructions.

  1. ******European Data Subjects**



_Data Controller_

EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). Quiet Revolution, located at the address in the “How to Contact Us” section below, is the controller with respect to the information you provide through the Website.

_Lawful Basis for Processing_

Data protection laws in Europe require a “lawful basis” for processing personal data.  Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given your consent to our processing for a specific purpose, either to us or to our service providers or partners; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to comply with a legal obligation; or (c) processing is necessary for the purpose of legitimate interests pursued by DST, and fundamental rights do not override these interests (as further detailed under “Use of Information” above). 

_Your Rights_

If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Service. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Service. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.

To exercise any of these rights, send a written request to us at the address provided under “How to Contact Us” below and specify which right you intend to exercise. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.

_Complaints_

If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a European supervisory authority. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a data protection regulator, and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us at the address provided under “How to Contact Us” below.

**How We Protect the Information**

We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to protect the information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e mail sent to or from the Website may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.

**Important Notices to Non-U.S. Residents**

We are based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law.  The Website and its servers are operated in the United States and elsewhere. Please be aware that your information, including your Personal Information, may be transferred to, processed, maintained, and used on computers, servers, and systems located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to use the Website, your use of the Website or provision of any information constitutes your consent to such transfer, processing, and use in the United States and elsewhere as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Children**

** ** This Website is intended for a general audience and not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age.  We do not knowingly collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA.  If you are a parent or guardian and believe that we have collected such information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, please contact us as set forth in the “How to Contact Us” section below, and we will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on the Website. By continuing to use the Website after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of the information is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collect the information. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis. If changes to the Privacy Policy are material, we may provide you additional notice to your e-mail address.
