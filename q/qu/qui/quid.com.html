    <h1>Quid Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div>
      <p>At Quid®, we are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information.&nbsp;It’s yours, it matters to you, and we get that.&nbsp;This Privacy Policy is to let you know what information we use and collect from users of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.quid.com/">www.quid.com</a>&nbsp;and other Quid URLs and websites (collectively, the “Sites”), the Quid software platform (“Quid Platform”), any of our services (“Services”), and on behalf of our clients. The Sites and the Quid Platform shall be included in the definition of Services for purposes of this Privacy Policy.<br></p>



<p>

  </p>











<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that is processed by Quid in the course of offering and operating the Services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the Quid&nbsp;<a href="https://quid.com/terms-and-conditions">Terms of Service</a> (“the “Terms”).&nbsp;By using our Sites or Services, you expressly agree to Quid’s collection, storage, use, processing and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p><strong>E.U. GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION</strong>

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p>Quid has taken steps in an effort to comply with the EU GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (“GDPR”) as set forth by the Council of the European Union and European Parliament, which became enforceable May 25, 2018, regarding the collection, use, transmission, processing, and retention of personal identifiable data of natural persons from European Union member countries. The GDPR is meant to strengthen the security and protection of personal data and to harmonize data protection laws throughout the EU.

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p>What this means is that we at Quid are committed to protecting your data in a secure and transparent manner. Quid processes, uses, and exchanges personal data for our legitimate business purposes only in the limited uses described herein.

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p>The Quid Platform only requires basic personal information from our users, such as name and email address, to facilitate user management, usage monitoring and provide our Services. Such data is stored in the Quid Platform infrastructure as well as with external vendors to the extent necessary to provide Quid’s Services. Quid does not use personal information for any purpose outside of providing the Services as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

<p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM OUR SITES AND SERVICES</strong>

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<ol><li><strong>Information You Provide:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;If      you contact us or register to receive our newsletter, create an account      with us, purchase products or services, send us an email, or share      personal information with us in any other way, we collect the information      you share.&nbsp;Depending on what information you choose to provide, this      may include your name, email address or billing information.&nbsp;You do      not always have to share this information with us, but without it, you may      not be able to access certain content or features or use certain Services.

  </li><li><strong>Posted:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;If you post information on      public areas of the Sites, the Services (or elsewhere on the Internet)      that information may be collected and used by anyone, including Quid.

  </li><li><strong>Automatic Collection:</strong>&nbsp;We and      third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on      our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other      technologies to automatically collect information through the Services.

Most      browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that,      the Services may not work properly. We also use third party analytics such      as Google Analytics to gather and analyze aggregated anonymous user      information. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.&nbsp;You      can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data generated by      your use of the Services by going to <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.

<ul><li><strong>Anonymous Information.</strong>&nbsp; The Services may      track the total number of visitors to the Services, the number of visitors      to each page of the Services, browser type, IP addresses, external      websites linked to and other usage statistics collected and used in      aggregate form collected through the Services and we may analyze this data      for trends and statistics in the aggregate but such information will be      maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not      contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate      information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’      movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We      may freely share anonymous user information with others, such as clients,      advertisers, sponsors and business partners.

   </li><li>As in any transaction, if you provide your credit card       information to us for purchases, your credit card company will be       provided with relevant information about us, services purchased, cost and       other information necessary to process the transaction.

   </li><li>We may disclose your personal information if permitted       or required by law, or where we reasonably believe such action is       necessary in order to protect or defend our interests or the interests of       our employees or users or business partners, such as to protect,       establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or       when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply       with the law, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or       investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,       threats to our property, suspected fraud, or violation of&nbsp;<a href="https://quid.com/terms-and-conditions">Quid’s Terms of Service</a>.

   </li><li>We may share personally identifiable information during       due diligence or in connection with a sale, merger, consolidation, change       in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or       liquidation.

  </p>











<p>

  </p>

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p><strong>THIRD PARTY SITES AND SERVICES</strong>

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p>The Services may contain links to other websites and other websites may reference or link to our Site or other Services.

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p><strong>RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, ERASURE AND RESTRICTION </strong>

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p>You may inquire as to whether Quid is processing personal information about you, request access to personal information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your personal information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@quid.com">privacy@quid.com</a> or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of personal information held about you by Quid. Please include your full name, email address associated with your Account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p>Although Quid makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their personal information, there may be circumstances in which Quid is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question, where the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, or where it is commercially proprietary. If Quid determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Quid will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p><strong>DATA RETENTION </strong>

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p><strong>SECURITY</strong>

  </p>











<p>

  </p>











<p>We take your security seriously and take reasonable steps to protect and secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure, including through secure sockets layer, password protection and, for certain transmissions to our Services, encryption. Any information collected by Quid is stored on servers that Quid manages, using standard security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information.&nbsp;Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information, please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp;As a result, Quid cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Sites or Services and you do so at your own risk.
