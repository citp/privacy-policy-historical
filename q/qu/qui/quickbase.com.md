We do not sell or rent your personal information to anyone. 

Third Party Service Providers. We have limited relationships with third parties to assist us in providing the Quick Base service to you, for example, by fulfilling customer orders or providing customer service. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide them. The contracts outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit third parties from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service for which they’ve been contracted. Vendors are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them. 

Legal Disclosures. We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, to enforce or apply our Terms of Service, available at [http://www.QuickBase.com/terms...](http://www.quickbase.com/terms-of-service) and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Quick Base, users of our service, or others.

When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the partner to fulfill your request. This Web site may provide links to third-party sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers.

Should we sell, merge or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your personal information and you agree that any such third party will have the right to continue to use your Personal Information and other information that you provide to us or which we obtain through your use of the service.
