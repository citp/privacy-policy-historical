You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on the Company’s Web site to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third party Social Media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Company’s Web site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.</p><h5>Do Not Track</h5><p>Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Quip does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Quip takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p><h5>Advertising</h5><p>We also partner with a third party to display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com" target="_blank">here</a>, or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.</p><h5>5. Public Forums, Refer a Friend, and Customer Testimonials</h5><p>Quip may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company’s Web sites. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Quip is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.</p><p>Customers and Visitors may elect to use the Company’s referral program to inform friends about the Company’s Web sites. When using the referral program, the Company requests the friend’s name and email address. Quip will automatically send the friend a one–time email inviting him or her to visit the Company’s Web sites. Quip does not store this information.</p><p>Quip posts a list of Customers and testimonials on the Company’s Web sites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. Quip obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.</p><h4>6. Sharing of information collected</h4><h5>Service Providers</h5><p>Quip may share Data about Quip Visitors, Customers and Attendees with the Company’s contracted service providers so that these service providers can provide services on our behalf. Without limiting the foregoing, Quip may also share Data about Quip Visitors, Customers and Attendees with the Company’s service providers to ensure the quality of information provided, and with third–party social networking and media Web sites, such as Facebook, for marketing and advertising on those Web sites. Unless described in this Privacy Statement, Quip does not share, sell, rent, or trade any information with third parties for their promotional purposes. A service provider providing services on our behalf is authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p><h5>Quip.com Affiliates</h5><p>The Company may share Data about Quip Customers with other companies in order to work with them, including affiliates of the Salesforce corporate group. For example, the Company may need to share Data about Quip Customers for customer relationship management, technical operations, marketing and account management purposes.</p><h5>Business Partners</h5><p>From time to time, Quip may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services, such as our AppExchange partners. If you download, purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly–offered product or service from or through Quip, the Company may share Data about Quip Customers collected in connection with your download, purchase or expression of interest with our partner(s). Quip does not control our business partners’ use of the Data about Quip Customers we collect, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to download, purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.</p><p>Quip does not share Data about Quip Attendees with business partners unless: (1) you specifically opt in to such sharing via an event registration form; or (2) you attend a Company event and allow Quip or any of its designees to scan your attendee badge. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may choose not to opt in via event registration forms and elect not to have your badge scanned at Company events. If you choose to share your information with business partners in the manners described above, your information will be subject to the business partners’ respective privacy statements.</p><h5>Third Parties</h5><p>Section 4 of this Privacy Statement, Web Site Navigational Information, specifically addresses the information we or third parties collect through cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies, and how you can control cookies through your Web browsers.</p><h5>Billing</h5><p>Quip uses a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on the Company’s behalf. Any billing service provider providing services on our behalf is authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p><h5>Compelled Disclosure</h5><p>Quip reserves the right to use or disclose information provided if required by law or if the Company reasonably believes that use or disclosure is necessary to protect the Company’s rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</p><h5>Your Request</h5><p>If you expressly ask us to do so, or give us your prior consent to do so, we may disclose information provided to a third party.</p><h5>Aggregate and Anonymous Information</h5><p>We may share aggregated,non-identifying information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p><h4>7. International transfer of information collected</h4><p>The Company primarily stores Data about Quip Customers and Data about Quip Attendees in the United States. To facilitate Quip’s global operations, the Company may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Company has operations. This Privacy Statement shall apply even if Quip transfers Data about Quip Customers or Data about Quip Attendees to other countries.</p><h4>8. Communications preferences</h4><p>Quip offers Visitors, Customers, and Attendees who provide contact information a means to choose how the Company uses the information provided. You may update your email preferences by using the “Unsubscribe” link found in emails we send to you, by accessing your account profile on our website, or by contacting us as described below.</p><h4>9. Correcting and updating your information</h4><p>You may access, correct or request deletion of Data We have about You by logging into your account. You may also request cancellation of your account by contacting us <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/form/contact/contact-privacy.jsp?display_type=lb&amp;contentWidth=420&amp;contentPadding=30" target="_blank">here</a>. We’ll take steps to delete your information within a reasonable timeframe, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</p><p>If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to us by a Quip Customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend, or delete such data, please inquire with our Customer directly. Because Quip personnel have limited ability to access data our Customers submit to our services, if you wish to make your request directly to Quip, please contact us <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/form/contact/contact-privacy.jsp?display_type=lb&amp;contentWidth=420&amp;contentPadding=30" target="_blank">here</a> and provide the name of the Quip Customer who submitted your data to our services. We will refer your request to that Customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p><h4>10. Customer Data</h4><p>Quip’s Customers may electronically submit data or information to the Services for hosting and processing purposes (“Customer Data”). Quip handles Customer Data in accordance with a Service’s terms of service or a subscription agreement in place between Quip and our Customers, which exclusively govern the Company’s treatment of Customer Data and supersede this Privacy Statement in case of conflict, or as required by law. In general, Quip may access Customer Data only for the purpose of providing the Services, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, or as may be required by law. Additional information about the Company’s privacy and security practices with respect to Customer Data is available <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?urlname=Trust-and-Compliance-Documentation&amp;language=en_US" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h4>11. Security</h4><p>Quip uses robust security measures to protect Data about Quip Customers and Data about Quip Attendees. Because the Company uses the Services to maintain Data about Salesforce Customers and Data about Salesforce Attendees, this information, which is stored in the Services, is secured in the same manner as described <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?urlname=Trust-and-Compliance-Documentation&amp;language=en_US">here</a>. We may retain Data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p><h4>12. Mobile applications</h4><p>Without limiting the generality of this Privacy Statement, in addition to information gathered through its Web sites or submitted to its Services, Quip may obtain information through applications (“Mobile Applications”) that Customers or their authorized individuals (“Users”) download to, and run on, their mobile devices (“Devices”). Mobile Applications provided by Quip may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services related to the relevant Mobile Application. For example, a Mobile Application may: access a camera on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload photographs to the Services; access the call history on a User’s Device to enable the User to upload that information to the Services; access calendar information on a User’s Device to enable the User to match meeting attendees with contacts submitted by the User to the Services; access the geographic location of a User’s Device to enable the User to identify contacts submitted by the User the Services who are nearby; or access contact information on a User’s Device to enable the User to sync contact information between the information that is stored on the User’s Device and the information that is submitted to the Services. Information obtained to provide Mobile Application services may include information obtained in preparation for anticipated updates to those services. Mobile Applications may transmit information to and from Devices to provide the Mobile Application services.</p><p>Mobile Applications may provide Quip with information related to Users’ use of the Mobile Application services, information regarding Users’ computer systems, and information regarding Users’ interaction with Mobile Applications, which Quip may use to provide and improve the Mobile Application services. For example, all actions taken in a Mobile Application may be logged, along with associated information (such as the time of day when each action was taken). Quip may also share anonymous data about these actions with third party providers of analytics services. In addition, if a User downloads a Quip Mobile Application after clicking on a third-party mobile advertisement for the Mobile Application or for Quip, the third-party advertiser may provide Quip with certain information, such as the User’s Device identification information, which Quip may use to track the performance of its advertising campaigns.</p><p>Customers may configure Quip Mobile Application services, and the information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be affected by the Customer’s configuration. In addition, if a Customer downloads and/or purchases more than one Service from Quip and its affiliates, a Mobile Application may be designed to interoperate with those Services; for instance, to provide a User with access to information from any or all of those Services or to provide information from a User’s Device to any or all of those Services. Information accessed or obtained by the Mobile Application on a User’s Device may be accessible to the Customer and its organization, depending on the intended functionality of the Mobile Application. In addition to Mobile Applications offered by Quip, the Company may offer platforms for the creation of third-party Mobile Applications. Third parties may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Users’ Devices to provide services associated with any third-party Mobile Applications that Users download, install, use, or otherwise interact with over a Quip platform. Quip’s Mobile Applications may also contain links or integrations to other Mobile Applications provided by third parties. Third parties’ use of information collected through third-party Mobile Applications is governed by the privacy statements of such third parties. The Company encourages you to review the privacy statements of third-party providers of Mobile Applications to understand their information practices.</p><p>Notices and contractual terms related to a particular Mobile Application may be found in the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service for that application. The Company encourages you to review the End User License Agreement or relevant terms of service related to any Mobile Applications you download, install, use, or otherwise interact with to understand that Mobile Application’s information practices. The Mobile Application’s access to information through a User’s Device does not cause that information to be "Customer Data" under Quip’s Master Subscription Agreement with the Customer or under this Privacy Statement, except as follows: To the extent that a User uses a Mobile Application to submit electronic data and information to a Customer account on our Services pursuant to the Customer's Master Subscription Agreement with Quip (or a similar agreement that governs the Customer’s subscription(s) to Quip’s Services), that information constitutes “Customer Data” as defined in such agreement, and the provisions of that agreement with respect to privacy and security of such data will apply.</p><h4>13. EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and U.S.-Swiss Privacy Shield Framework</h4><p>The Services comply with the EU–U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Salesforce has certified to the Department of Commerce that the Services adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles.

Changes to this Privacy Statement</h4><p>Quip reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement. Quip will provide notification of the material changes to this Privacy Statement through the Company’s Web sites prior to the change taking effect.</p><h4>15.
