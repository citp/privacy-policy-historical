## Children Users

### Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

To comply with COPPA, we only collect Personal Information from children under 13 after the student’s school, district or teacher has agreed to obtain parental consent for that child to use our Website and to provide us with Personal Information.

While parents or guardians of children under 13 may sign up their child and provide us with Personal Information about the child, no child under 13 may sign up with us or send us Personal Information unless they are signing up through their school, district or teacher, and that school, district or teacher has obtained parental or guardian consent to use our Website and provide us with Personal Information.

If you are under 13, do not send us any Personal Information unless you are signing up through your school, district or teacher, and that school, district or teacher has obtained parental consent for you to use our Website and provide us with Personal Information.

If we find any users who are under 13 and have shared Personal Information with us without signing up through a school, district or teacher that has obtained parental consent to use our Website and provide us with Personal Information, we will delete this information as quickly as possible. If you are aware, or become aware, of any users who have violated any part of this section, please email us at hello@quill.org so that we can investigate.

If you are signing up for the Website and creating accounts on behalf of student(s), you represent and warrant that you are either (a) a teacher or school administrator or otherwise authorized by a school or district to sign up on behalf of students, or (b) the parent of such student(s). If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and all similar applicable laws, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. When obtaining consent, you must provide parents and guardians with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services as part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use on behalf of your school and/or district.
