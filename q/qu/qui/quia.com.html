                  Quia Corporation collects information in several ways from different 
                  parts of our Web site.<br>
                  <br>
                  Some personal information is gathered when you register. Quia 
                  Corporation asks for your name, e-mail address, username, and 
                  password during registration. Once you register you are no longer 
                  anonymous to Quia Corporation and are able to take full advantage 
                  of Quia's free service.<br>
                  <br>
                  In addition to during registration, we may ask you for personal 
                  information at other times, such as when you report a problem 
                  with one of our sites or services. Quia Corporation also encourages 
                  users to complete surveys that we use for site enhancement and 
                  research purposes. If you contact Quia Corporation, such as 
                  through the use of surveys, we may keep a record of that correspondence. 
                  Wherever Quia Corporation collects personal information, we 
                  make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that 
                  page.<br>

                  use them?</b><br>
                  As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized 
                  services, Quia Corporation uses <a href="/cookies.html" class="link-underlined"> 
                  cookies</a> to store and sometimes track information about you. 
                  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser 
                  from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
                  All sites on Quia Corporation where you are prompted to log 
                  in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies.<br>
                  <br>
                  Generally, we use cookies to: <br>
                  <br>
                  (1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information 
                  (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better 
                  and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register 
                  or "Log In" and is modified when you "Log Out" of our services. 
                  If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use 
                  those Quia Corporation services, such as the activity and quiz 
                  creation tools, that require registration in order to participate.<br>
                  <br>
                  (2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing Quia 
                  Corporation is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine 
                  the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus 
                  by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based 
                  on user interests and behavior.<br>
                  <br>
                  (3) Identify registered users who take our <a href="/commentsAndSuggestions.html" class="link-underlined">online 
                  survey</a>.<br>
                  <br>
                  (4) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of Quia Corporation's 
                  Web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the 
                  aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' 
                  habits are similar or different from one another so that we 
                  can make each new experience on Quia Corporation a better one. 
                  We may use this information to better personalize the content, 
                  banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on 
                  our sites.<br>
                  <br>
                  Advertising networks that serve ads onto Quia Corporation may 
                  also use their own cookies.<br>

                  <a name="PD"></a> <b>How does Quia Corporation use my information?</b><br>
                  Quia Corporation's primary goal in collecting personal information 
                  is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on 
                  our sites. This includes personalization services, interactive 
                  communications, and many other types of services, all of which 
                  are completely free to you. In order to provide services free 
                  of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about 
                  you, Quia Corporation is able to deliver more relevant advertisements 
                  and content, and hence better service, to you. In our role of 
                  delivering targeted advertisements, Quia Corporation plays the 
                  middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us 
                  the type of audience they want to reach (for example, instructors 
                  of a particular subject). Quia Corporation takes the advertisement 
                  and displays it to users meeting those criteria. In this process, 
                  the advertiser never has access to individual account information. 
                  Only Quia Corporation has access to individuals' accounts. This 
                  kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads through 
                  Quia Corporation Web locations. Also with this type of targeting, 
                  the advertisements are more likely to be of particular interest 
                  to Quia users. <br>
                  <br>
                  Quia Corporation does research on our users' demographics, interests, 
                  and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, 
                  from our server log files, or from surveys. We do this to better 
                  understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and 
                  analyzed on an aggregated basis. Quia Corporation may share 
                  this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.<br>

                  <u>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate</u>. Under confidentiality 
                  agreements, Quia Corporation may match user information with 
                  third party data. Also, Quia Corporation discloses aggregated 
                  user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in 
                  order to describe our services to current and prospective partners,

                  <u>Other</u>. Quia Corporation may also disclose account information 
                  in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing 
                  this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring 
                  legal action against someone who may be violating Quia Corporation's 
                  Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference 
                  with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Quia Corporation's 
                  rights or property, other Quia Corporation users, or anyone 
                  else that could be harmed by such activities. Quia Corporation 
                  may disclose or access account information when we believe in 
                  good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and 
                  other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, 
                  and improve our products and services.<br>

                  As a global company, Quia Corporation has international users 
                  all over the world. When you give Quia Corporation personal 
                  information, that information may be sent electronically to 
                  servers outside of the country where you originally entered 
                  the information, such as to the United States or other countries. 
                  In addition, that information may be used, stored, and processed 
                  outside of the country where you entered that information. Whenever 
                  Quia Corporation handles personal information as described above, 
                  regardless of where this occurs, Quia Corporation takes steps

                  while we strive to protect your personal information, Quia Corporation

                  <a name="PJ"></a><b> What about children's privacy?</b><br>
                  Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no Web site 
                  operator is permitted to require a child under the age of 13 
                  to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to 
                  participate in an activity as a condition of participation. 
                  Quia Corporation abides by this requirement. Quia Corporation 
                  does not gather information on the ages of our users and will 
                  never knowingly share personally identifying information about 
                  users who are under the age of 13 with business partners or 
                  other third parties. When contacting our users, Quia Corporation 
                  requests that anyone under the age of 13 forward the e-mail 
                  to a parent or guardian. All Quia account holders, including 
                  parents and children with Quia accounts, are subject to this 
                  Privacy Policy.<br>

                  <a name="PK"></a><b> What else should I know about my privacy?</b><br>
                  Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
                  information online - for example on message boards, through 
                  e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected 
                  and used by others. In short, if you post personal information 
                  online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited 
                  messages from other parties in return.<br>
                  <br>
                  When creating materials on the Quia Web site, you must choose 
                  whether or not to show your name and e-mail address. If you 
                  decide to show your name and e-mail address, you are making 
                  it available to others over the Internet. Furthermore, if you 
                  have chosen to have your name displayed on your Quia activity 
                  page(s) and you nominate an activity for it to appear on the 
                  Quia Directory, your name will appear in the directory. Remember 
                  that the choice of displaying your name and e-mail address on 
                  the Quia Web site is entirely up to you. By publishing your 
                  name and e-mail address, you may receive correspondence from 
                  other Quia users. For example, someone may send you an e-mail 
                  to let you know that your activity is extremely helpful, or 
                  to point out errors in your activity. Many Quia users appreciate 
                  the opportunity to receive this feedback; however, the choice 
                  to include this information is yours.<br>
                  <br>
                  Additionally, Quia offers a home-page building tool, specifically 
                  designed to allow educators to custom build class pages for 
                  their own use. Just like any other home page building tool, 
                  the home pages created can be accessed by anyone over the Internet. 
                  Please do not include any information on your home page that 
                  you do not want to disclose over the Internet.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy 
                  of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be 
                  careful and responsible whenever you're online. <br>
