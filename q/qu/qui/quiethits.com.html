<div class="article">
<p>PRIVACY POLICY - COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</p>

<p>This site is owned and operated by QuietHits.com. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At QuietHits.com, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.</p>

<p>Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.</p>

<p>INFORMATION QUIETHITS.COM GATHERS AND TRACKS</p>

<p>QuietHits.com gathers two types of information about users:</p>
<ul> <li>Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to participate in our forums</li>
<li>Information QuietHits.com gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because QuietHits.com derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does QuietHits.com divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. </li> </ul> 
<p>QuietHits.com Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>

<p>Optional Voluntary Information</p>

<p>We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:</p>

<p>1. Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)</p>

<p>We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. QuietHits.com will gather the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.</p>

<p>2. Forums policy</p>

<p>Users of the site's Forums must register separately for these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.</p>

<p>3. "E-mail this to a friend" policy</p>

<p>Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend." The user must provide his email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>

<p>Children</p>

<p>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.</p>

<p>Usage tracking</p>

<p>QuietHits.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout our site. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. QuietHits.com does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).</p>

<p>QuietHits.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.</p>

<p>Cookies</p>

<p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information, although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. QuietHits.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.</p>

<p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.</p>
