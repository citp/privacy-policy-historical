# Privacy - Quimbee

## 1\. **Introduction**.

1.1. Effective Date. The effective date of this Privacy Policy is December 1, 2017.

1.2. Purpose. Sellers International LLC (“Quimbee” or “ **Company** ”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of users of the Quimbee website, the Quimbee service, and any software applications made available by Quimbee, such as any mobile device application Quimbee makes available (together, the “ **Service** ”). Quimbee has published this “Privacy Policy” to show its commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of privacy.

1.3. Scope. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Service, and not to any websites or services of third parties (“ **Third Party Websites** ”), which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. For additional information, see Section 10 (Third Party Websites) and Section 4.2.3 (Third Party Cookies and Advertising).

1.4. Separate Terms of Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have also read and understood, and agree to be bound by, both this Privacy Policy and Quimbee’s separate Terms of Service document (the “ **Terms of Service** ”), which is incorporated by reference and made part of this Privacy Policy. The Terms of Service document is available at <https://www.quimbee.com/about/terms>.

1.5. **_No Permission Without Agreement. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have read and understood, and agree to the terms of, this Privacy Policy. If you do not understand or do not agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, you must immediately cease using or accessing the Service_**.

## 2\. **Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy**.

2.1. Each time you access the Service, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Each time you use the Service, we recommend that you check the date of this Privacy Policy in Section 1.1 (Effective Date) and review any changes since the last time you used the Service.

2.2. Although most changes are likely to be minor, Quimbee reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, update, change, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting a new version on this page. Any such addition, update, or change will be effective immediately on posting. Unless Quimbee obtains your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy, and not to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policy.

## 3\. **Children’s Privacy**. 

Quimbee does not solicit or knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If Quimbee obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, Quimbee will immediately delete that information from its database. Because Quimbee does not collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, Quimbee has no such information to use or disclose to third parties. Quimbee has designed this Privacy Policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

## 4\. **Information Collection Practices**.

4.1. **Traffic Data**. Like most website and mobile application operators, Quimbee collects information that web browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) Internet domain names; (iii) types of devices accessing the Service; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Service (collectively “ **Traffic Data** ”). Traffic Data is not meant to personally identify you, although it may be possible to identify you using Traffic Data in combination with other data.

4.2. **Cookie Policy**. “ **Cookies** ” are text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit or certain emails that you open. Cookies store a string of information on a user’s computer or mobile device, which the user’s web browser provides to the Service automatically each time it interacts with the Service. The purpose of Cookies is to identify the user as a unique user of the Service, or to store the user’s preferences for that website. Quimbee uses two types of Cookies: “first-party cookies” and “third-party cookies.”

4.2.1. **First Party Cookies**. Quimbee uses first-party Cookies on the Service for the following purposes: (1) to gather visitor and access information relevant to customizing the Service to your interests and (2) to store your user ID so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Service.

4.2.2. **_If you do not wish to have first-party Cookies placed on your computer or mobile device, you should set your web browser to refuse Cookies before accessing the Service. However, certain features of the Service may not function properly without the aid of Cookies. If you refuse Cookies, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality_**.

4.2.3. **Third Party Cookies and Advertising**.

4.2.3.1. **Advertising on Third Party Websites**. Quimbee may advertise on other Third Party Websites to you after you access the Service. We and third-party marketing partners, including without limitation Google, Inc. (“ **Google** ”), may use first-party Cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie), third-party Cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie), and web beacons (such as the Facebook conversion-tracking pixel, see <https://www.facebook.com/business/a/online-sales/conversion-tracking>), including across multiple devices, to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements to you based on your use of the Service. This practice is commonly known as retargeting or remarketing (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting>).

4.2.3.2. **Google Analytics**.

4.2.3.2.1. Google Analytics is a web analytics service that helps website and app owners understand how their visitors engage with their properties. It may use a set of cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. The main cookie used by Google Analytics is the “__ga” cookie. Quimbee uses Google Analytics on the Quimbee website.

4.2.4. **Opting Out of Third Party Cookies**.

4.2.4.1. You may customize your Google Cookies preferences or opt out of using Google Cookies on the Google Ads Settings page at <http://www.google.com/settings/ads>.

4.2.4.3. You may opt out of using other third parties’ Cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>. You can also learn more about how to delete or control Cookies at <http://www.aboutcookies.org/>.

4.3. **Third Party Analytics Services**.

Quimbee selects Third Party Analytics Services to help provide the Service to you; for example, Google Analytics. Quimbee only shares information with the Third Party that is required for the service they are offering and contractually bind these providers to keep any information Quimbee shares with them as confidential and to be used only for particular purposes.

4.4. **Analytics Policy and Device Ad ID Collection**.

4.4.1. Advertising IDs or “ **Device Ad ID** ”s are files that are placed on your mobile application by your device manufacturer. More information is available at <https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/id.html>. The purpose of a Device Ad ID is to identify the user as a unique user of the Service without collecting Personal Information.

4.4.2. Quimbee collects Device Ad IDs.

4.4.3. **_If you do not wish for Quimbee to access your Device Ad ID, you must inform Quimbee of your opt-out immediately, using the “Contact Us” form available through your account, and then permanently cease all use of Quimbee. If you opt out in this fashion, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality_**.

4.5. **Personally Identifiable Information**. To use certain features of the Service, you might be asked to provide Quimbee certain personally identifiable information (“ **Personal Information** ”). Personal Information includes the following categories, without limitation: (1) “ **Contact Data** ” (such as your name, phone number, fax number, mailing address and email address); (2) “ **Financial Data** ” (such as your credit/debit card number, expiration date, and billing address); (3) “ **Demographic Data** ” (such as your law school graduation date, law school attended, and your billing ZIP code); and (4) “ **Third Party Social Media Account Data** ” (such as your account information for third party social media accounts when you access the Service in connection to those accounts). In each case, you will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Service will not gather it secretly. Quimbee may supplement the Personal Information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or from third parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide that information to Quimbee.

Any information that you choose to disclose through such features becomes public information over which Quimbee is unable to exercise control. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information through these features, and you agree to assume all responsibility for doing so.
