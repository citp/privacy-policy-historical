	<a name="Notice"></a>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">We provide you notice of our Web site information practices</span><br>
	We collect certain information, such as personally identifiable information, from you when you use our Web sites. "Personally identifiable information" is that information which can identify you as an individual, such as your name, address, e-mail, and credit card information. Here is a description of the information we collect and how it is used:<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">QuickBase Registration</span><br>
	When you register for a QuickBase account, you are required to provide your e-mail address and country of primary residence. We ask you to provide a password and a challenge question and answer to protect your information from unauthorized access and alteration. We also request optional demographic information (which helps us understand our QuickBase customers). Providing your name, screen name and demographic information is optional. When registering for a corporate trial, we require name, company name, and phone number. On occasion, we may use your contact information, such as your name, billing address, and e-mail address, to send communications we think you will find useful, including information about special Intuit offers, QuickBase releases and upgrades, other new Intuit products and services, or those of other companies. Intuit does not share your contact information except as disclosed in this privacy statement. To opt out of receiving any of these communications, simply indicate your contact preference at the time of registration or contact us at <a href="https://privacy.intuit.com" target="_new" class="contentLinks">https://privacy.intuit.com</a>. We may also combine certain information about you with that of other individuals and customers to create aggregate, anonymous data that we will use to, for example, improve our products and services and develop new ones. Aggregate data is general information about groups of customers, but not about you as an individual.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">QuickBase Billing</span><br>
	When you subscribe to a level of QuickBase service requiring a fee, we require that you provide your billing address and your credit card information, including credit card number and expiration date. Credit card information is used solely for the purpose of billing you for QuickBase service. Credit card and purchase order information is not shared with third parties except as required to process payments. <br>
	<br>
	For your convenience, we give you the option of billing your QuickBase service to a "workgroup." If you choose to join a workgroup for billing purposes, ownership of your QuickBase data will be transferred to that workgroup. The workgroup owner is responsible for payment and can transfer ownership of your data. Workgroup owners and administrators should keep in mind that any other workgroup administrators will have access to the workgroup's billing information.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">QuickBase Database Access</span><br>
	Any content you place in a QuickBase database will not be publicly available unless you voluntarily choose to give permission to other QuickBase users, to QuickBase groups, or to the general public for that database. Intuit personnel will not view, use, or distribute the content of any of your databases without your prior permission or the express permission of the database owner, except as stated under "Legal Disclosures."<br>
	<br>
	You have control over who has access to the data in your databases. When you first create a database, only you have access. At your discretion, you may choose to allow others access to your database. You decide who gets access and at what level (view, modify and/or create).<br>
	<br>
	Your database information is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Intuit personnel will not require you to divulge your password, even to provide support or assistance. Remember to sign out of your QuickBase account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to prevent others from accessing your databases if you share a computer with someone else, or are using a computer in a public place, like a library or Internet café.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">QuickBase Workgroups</span><br>
	QuickBase Workgroups allow access and control over database information dependent upon the roles assigned to specific members of the workgroup.<br>
<br>
A workgroup owner can delete your data without your permission. However, the workgroup owner will not have privileges to view or alter the data unless you grant such access. Workgroup members will be able to see each other's e-mail addresses in addition to their QuickBase screen names. This will increase your ability to correctly identify a QuickBase user within your workgroup, which is helpful when granting access permissions. Workgroup administrators will also be able to deactivate a workgroup member's user account. Please exercise caution when assigning workgroup administration rights.<br>
<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Technical Support and Feedback</span><br>
	To obtain technical support, we ask you to provide your name and e-mail address. This information may be used to contact you regarding your technical support request. We also offer you the opportunity to provide feedback. When submitting feedback to us, your name and e-mail address may be used to respond to your comments or suggestions.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">More on Our General Information Practices<br>
	Newsletters</span><br>
	We provide you the opportunity to subscribe to e-mail newsletters and other e-mail communications. You may unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in each e-mail newsletter.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold"><a name="e-mail_messaging">E-Mail Message Formatting</a><br>
E-Mail Messaging.</span> When sending you e-mail, we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF, that allows us to format messages tailored to your computer's capabilities. We also use this technology to determine, in the aggregate, the number of people who open our e-mails. When you initiate a response by clicking on a link within an e-mail message, you are redirected onto the Internet. We then record your individual response to help us deliver information that is more relevant to your interests.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">	Contests, Sweepstakes and Surveys</span><br>
	From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in contests, sweepstakes or surveys. If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, preferences, or other information. This information may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings, or award prizes. Our contests may have separate rules and we will identify how the information that you supply will be used in each case.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Mandatory and Optional Information</span><br>
	We identify what information is required to fulfill your request and what information is optional. If you choose not to provide mandatory information, we will not be able to provide the service you are requesting.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Intuit and Its Subsidiaries</span><br>
	If you are a U.S. customer, Intuit and its subsidiaries may share your personally identifiable information with each other to fulfill your requests or to provide you with information about other products or services that you may find valuable.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold"> Co-Branded or Third-Party Sites</span><br>
	Some of the products or services offered on this Web site are provided by third parties who are carefully selected by Intuit. When you request to receive these services, we will forward your customer information to these third parties, as necessary to fulfill your request. When offering the services of another party on an Intuit or co-branded site, the party who will receive your information will be clearly identified. The QuickBase Web site may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business associates and online advertisers. On these sites, Intuit and/or the identified third party may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Service Providers</span><br>
	In some cases, we will employ or work with service providers, such as consultants, temporary workers, third-party software developers, or outsourcers, to complete a business process or provide a service. For example, we may use service providers to deliver products, to offer online software applications, or to send e-mails on our behalf. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to act on our behalf.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Service Alerts and Critical Notices</span><br>
	To limit any possible interruption of services you request, we may use your contact information to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to use this service or for other critical non-marketing purposes, such as bug alerts. We may also contact you to respond to your specific requests or to clarify the order information you provided to us, or to notify you of upcoming subscription updates.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Change of Control</span><br>
	Your personally identifiable information may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Intuit and/or its subsidiaries ("Transfer").  You will have the opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information following any change of control. In the event of a Transfer of QuickBase to a third party, you consent to the transfer of the personally identifiable information in your customer account to that third party for the sole purpose of enabling the third party to continue to provide you with service.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</span><br>
	If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we’ll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take effect.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Transmission of Information Outside of Your Country</span><br>
	If you are located outside the U.S., your personally identifiable information and database(s) may be stored and processed outside of the country of which you are a citizen and/or in which you reside. By using QuickBase, you consent to the transmission of your personally identifiable information outside of your country so that it may be used for purposes consistent with those specified in this Privacy Statement and in the "Terms of Services." If you are within the European Economic Area, you should be aware that such extra-territorial transmissions may be to countries outside of the European Economic Area which may have different data protection laws. When this occurs, Intuit shall take appropriate steps to protect the information transmitted.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Legal Disclosures</span><br>
	In some cases, we may disclose certain information (including, when applicable, your personally identifiable information) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.<br>

	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">How and why we use Web technologies</span><br>
	Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web site:<br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Cookies</span><br>
	A “cookie” is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our site. The QuickBase Web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to authenticate registered QuickBase users. This cookie is also used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). You do not have to accept cookies from our site. However, in order to register and subsequently log on to the site, you must accept cookies. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies. <br>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">Web Site Usage Data</span><br>
	With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data in the aggregate to better understand Web site usage, including what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. <br>
	<a name="Choices"></a>
	<br>
	<span class="contentBold">We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information you provide to us may be used</span><br>
	We give you the opportunity to control the use of your personal information for purposes other than to fulfill your request. For example, on occasion we may use your contact information to send you promotional communications about Intuit products and services or those of our partners. If you do not wish to receive such communications, you may specify your contact preferences during the information collect process or by contacting us at <a href="https://privacy.intuit.com" target="_new" class="contentLinks">https://privacy.intuit.com</a>.

	<span class="contentBold">We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration</span><br>
	We use industry standard security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. Whenever we prompt you to transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number, to us through our Web site, we support SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption of your data as it is transmitted to us.<br>
	<br>
	We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site’s servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All Intuit employees must review and sign a written statement of these practices, which include limiting access to sensitive information to only those employees who require the information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.<br>
