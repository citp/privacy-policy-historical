# QuickWeb - Terms of Service (Tos)

We respect your right to privacy and support the recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enforced on 25th May 2018.

At this time we do not provide service to individuals below 13 years of age.

Transfer of data outside of the European Union (EU)

Your personal information may be transferred to and stored at our office and associated data centers. By accepting our Terms of Service and/or a software EULA, you are explicitly consenting to this transfer and storage taking place. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
