## 5\. Overseas disclosure

5.1 From time to time, we may transfer your personal information to overseas recipients (including our related companies and any relevant third parties) if it is necessary to conduct our business.  We currently have operations in Australia, the United States and in the United Kingdom and personal information is disclosed to recipients in those jurisdictions. We also use cloud-based solutions such as Shopify, Netsuite and EDI that store personal information securely primarily in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. We may from time to time expand our operations and/or change the cloud-based or other solutions used to store personal information.

5.2 We take reasonable steps to ensure that the receiving party provides commitments relating to privacy and confidentiality which require the receiving party to limit its use of your personal information and to protect your personal information against misuse, loss and unauthorised access.  Where you are based in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (EEA), and we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we will impose the same data protection safeguards that we deploy inside the EEA.

5.3 By acknowledging this Policy, you hereby expressly consent to our transfer of your personal information as described in this section 5. 

## 6\. Storage and security of personal information

6.1 Where we hold your personal information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the information is secure and may only be accessed by authorised persons. Where we store your personal information electronically on our database, we use secure servers and there are restrictions as to who has access to that information through password protection. All hardcopies of personal information are stored in secure areas.  Please notify us immediately if you believe there has been any unauthorised access to your information.

6.2 Although we take reasonable steps, we do not control how a third-party partner may use your data. Please note that third party recipients of personal information may have their own privacy policies and we are not responsible for their actions, including their handling of personal information.

6.3 We keep personal information as long as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Policy or otherwise in compliance with our or our service providers’ data retention policies.  Certain information may be retained until the time limit for any legal challenges has expired or in order to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such personal information.  If you have provided us with personal information in the course of applying for employment with us, and your application has not been successful, we may keep your personal information in case a suitable role becomes available.  Where applicable, if any personal information that we hold is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected and no applicable law requires us to retain that information, we will take reasonable steps to de-identify or destroy the information.

## 7\. Access and correction

7.1 We will take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we hold is complete, up to date and accurate, so far as it is practicable for us to do so.

7.3 Subject to paragraph 7.4, if personal information we hold about you is incorrect, we will, on your request to correct it or where we are satisfied that the information is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the information is corrected.

7.4 If you request us to correct personal information that we hold about you and we refuse to do so, we will, to the extent reasonable, provide you a written response as to our reasons.

## 9\. Direct marketing

9.1 From time to time, we may use your personal information for direct marketing purposes (for an indefinite period).  Where required by law, we will ask for your consent before conducting any of these types of marketing.  This includes sending you updates about our products and offerings.
