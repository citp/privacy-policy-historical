# Quantum : privacy

This statement applies with respect to information we collect from quantum.com and any other sites on the World Wide Web owned and/or operated by Quantum Corporation, but does not address our activities with respect to the Registered Customer accounts that we offer. This statement is part of our user agreement and is subject to all of its terms. Other Web sites (including those we link to) have their own practices. 

If you have any questions, comments, or requests regarding privacy, please send us an email at [online@quantum.com](mailto:online@quantum.com).

## Collection of Information

We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address or most-recently-visited URL. However, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, such as by filling out a form or survey, entering a contest or sweepstakes, registering your email address with us or emailing us. We may also collect personal information from you at other points on our site that state that personal information is being collected. 

We do not wish to obtain personally identifiable information from children who are using our site unsupervised. Thus, we ask children to obtain the consent of their parent or guardian before providing us with any personally identifiable information.

## Disclosure of Information

Unless we tell you otherwise, we do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to any third parties. However, we might share your personally identifiable information with Quantum business partners, and we do sell and rent aggregated (non-personally identifiable) information about our users generally.

## Use of Information

We use personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information for internal marketing purposes and for site administration. However, unless we tell you otherwise, we usually do not use personally identifiable information collected from the Web site to send unsolicited mailings to you. Of course, if applicable, we do use personally identifiable information to perform the services for which such data was collected (i.e., if you sign up for an email newsletter, we will send the email newsletter to the address you provide us). 

## Third Party Sites 

This policy only addresses our activities from our servers. Other sites (including those that we link to within an advertisement banner or otherwise, and third party sites or services which we cobrand) may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by this policy. 

## Review and Removal of Your Personally Identifiable Data 

If you provide us with personally identifiable information to have us perform ongoing services to you, usually we will provide you with a way to review the information we have on file and either change or remove such data. Unfortunately, to the extent that such information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will reach the other databases. If you wish to have information that you provided to us online removed from our records, please give us instructions, including the specific data you want removed, by sending us an email at [online@quantum.com](mailto:online@quantum.com). 

We will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is removed from our online records.

## Cookies and Other Tracking Methods 

When you view our website or advertisements, we might store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site, to help you navigate a website as easily as possible. Cookies can help us provide information that is targeted to your interests and they allow us to better understand how users use our site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site, including that portion which is targeted for our Registered Customers, may not work properly in that case. 

## Security

We use industry-standard methods to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access. Among other techniques, we usually store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we often restrict the number of employees internally who can access such data. Of course, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet.

## Amendments

Amendments to this policy will be posted at this URL and will be effective when posted.
