<h1>Quantopian</h1>
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Quantopian is both a platform and a community.
It's a place to write and test trading algorithms.
It's a place to meet other algorithm writers, to share algorithms, ideas, strategies, and trading experiences.
Quantopian, Inc. ("**Quantopian**", "**we**" or "**us**") is committed to protecting your privacy.
We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Information (as defined below) we collect from users of our website, located at quantiopian.com, (<strong>"Site"</strong>) and related Services (as defined in the Terms of Use).
If you simply browse the Site, you are referred to in this Privacy Policy as a "**Visitor**."
If you have registered with the Site and receive Services, you are referred to in this Privacy Policy as a "**Member**."
Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our Terms of Use located at <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/policies/terms">https://www.quantopian.com/policies/terms</a>.</p>
<h3>1. User Consent</h3>
<p></p>
<p>By submitting Personal Information through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of the Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>2. A Note to Users Outside of the United States.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>If you are a non U.S. user of the Site or Services, by visiting the Site and/or providing us with information, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy.  In addition, your Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.  By providing your information, you consent to such transfer.</p>
<h3>3. Children</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our Services and Site are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services.  Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.  We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services is designed to attract people under 13 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and the Services.</p>
<h3>4. Types of Information We Collect.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>So that we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we refer to "**Personal Information**" we mean information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information.  When we refer to "**Anonymous Information**" we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact with individual persons.  </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>
<h4>Information You Provide to Us.</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Members Only</h5>
<ul>
<li>We may collect Personal Information from you, such as your first and last name, physical mailing address, phone, e-mail address, age, ethnicity, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, education level, interests, hobbies and password when you create an Account.</li>

<li>We retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you store using your Account and/or when you create a profile (your “Profile”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Information Collected via Technology.</h4>
<ul>
<li>To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), and domain name.</li>
<li>
<p>We also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the website URL you were visiting immediately before you came to our Site and the website URL you visit as you leave our Site and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. "**Cookies**" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s web browser while you are viewing a website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.  Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions; please note that certain aspects of the Site or Services may not be available if the Persistent Cookies are removed.</p>
</li>
<li>We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us analyze visitor activity on the Site. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for us.</li>
<li>If you are logged into the Site or Services, the information collected via technology as described in this Section may be associated with your Personal Information and will, accordingly, be treated as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>We collect and store performance data generated by your algorithms when you use the platform to backtest, paper trade, and live trade.</li>
<li>We may generate additional performance data from your algorithms for the purposes of (a) verifying that software platform changes do not change or break your algorithm and/or (b) analyzing standardized performance results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>5. Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We have created and may offer you interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking websites such as Facebook ("**SN Site**") through our Site. We will work with the SN Site’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that SN Site on your behalf.  In order to provide this authorization, you will not provide us with your user name or password to the SN Site, but you will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site. Once authorized by you, the SN Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SN Site, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide you.</p>
<h3>6. Use of Personal Information</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>
<h4>Your Personal Information.</h4>
In general, Personal Information you submit to us regarding you or your company is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better.  We use such Personal Information in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>to publish such Personal Information to Visitors and other Members of the Site and Services, but only when you make such Personal Information available in public areas of the Site and Services</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Creation of Anonymous Information.</strong>  We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as the name) that makes the information personally identifiable to the data subject.
