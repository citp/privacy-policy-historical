			<b>a.  Personal Information You Actively Submit to Quamut.com and Quamut Wiki.</b>  You may choose to provide certain personal information to Quamut.com or 
			Quamut Wiki through these sites. This "personal information" may include your name, billing address, shipping address(es), telephone number, email 
			address, and credit card number. You may be asked to provide this information when you want to register for the websites, purchase printed or downloadable 
			PDF formatted content, post to message boards, or contact us with a question or comment. To use all features of the Quamut.com and Quamut Wiki websites, 
			you need to create a password-protected account with us. When you want to make a purchase or change your stored personal information, we approve your 
			access by verifying your email address with your password. You can browse the Quamut.com and Quamut Wiki sites and read online content without having to 
			submit personal information.
			<div class="spc20">&nbsp;</div>
			
			We use the personal information described above to fulfill your orders, provide customer support, and communicate with you. In addition, Quamut.com and 
			Quamut Wiki may use the information to market its products and services to you. When you register with Quamut.com or Quamut Wiki, you can choose whether 
			you wish to receive marketing communications from us.   
			
			<div class="spc20">&nbsp;</div>
			
			Except as described below, Quamut.com and Quamut Wiki will not disclose your personal information to third parties who are not our affiliates without 
			your consent. We do not sell or exchange customer lists or customer information for marketing purposes with unaffiliated third parties, and will not 
			do so without your express permission. We may share anonymous, aggregate information concerning the demographic makeup of our customers to unrelated third parties.
			<div class="spc20">&nbsp;</div>
			
			We may share personal information we collect for business purposes with companies and individuals who provide servicing, administrative, marketing, and 
			other services for us, or on our behalf. Companies we hire to provide such services are only permitted, by contract, to use your information for the 
			performance of the specific services we have requested of them, and are restricted from using such information in any way not expressly authorized by Quamut.com or Quamut Wiki.
			<div class="spc20">&nbsp;</div>
			
			Quamut.com and Quamut Wiki may disclose personal information to government and regulatory authorities as permitted or required by applicable law, to 
			enforce or apply the terms of any of our policies or user agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Quamut.com, Quamut Wiki, our users, or others.
			
			<div class="spc20">&nbsp;</div>
			
			Quamut.com and Quamut Wiki are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites that may be linked to this site. When you click 
			on links and banners on our sites that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies you are linking from our sites or browsing on your own.  
			
			<div class="spc20">&nbsp;</div>
			
			Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any personal information, photographs, video or other content that you may disclose publicly on any message board or 
			similar public forum. Further, Quamut.com, Quamut Wiki and its affiliated entities assume no liability for any action of any third party who collects any information users 
			may publicly disclose through such public forums.
			
			<div class="spc20">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<b>b. Automatically Collected Information.</b>  Quamut.com and Quamut Wiki use tracking software and similar technology, which automatically collects anonymous information 
			about your computer hardware and software when you visit the Quamut.com and Quamut Wiki sites. We receive and collect the name of the domain and host from which you access 
			the Internet, the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the browser software you use and your operating system, the date and time you access our sites, 
			and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our sites. We use this information to monitor the usage of our sites. Also, when we send emails to you, 
			we may be able to identify information about your email address, such as whether you can read graphic-rich HTML emails. All of the information we automatically capture provides 
			us with the ability to enhance our users' experience at Quamut.com or Quamut Wiki and to determine aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns.
			<div class="spc20">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<b>c. Information Collected via Cookies.</b>  Quamut.com, Quamut Wiki and its third party advertisers may use cookies to enhance your experience on the Quamut.com and Quamut Wiki sites. 
			"Cookies" are small files or records that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on Quamut.com or the Qumaut Wiki site, and which allow us 
			to better customize your visit to the sites. The information captured makes it possible for us (i) to speed navigation, keep track of your purchases, and provide you with custom tailored 
			content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the Quamut.com or Quamut Wiki sites; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of certain 
			of our marketing email campaigns; (iv) to monitor total number of registered users and their associated demographic information, pages viewed, and the total number of banners served; and (v) 
			to target advertising according to demographic information.
			<div class="spc20">&nbsp;</div>
			
			Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit most web sites because browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to 
			have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placement. If you refuse cookies, however, you will not be able to complete an order 
			with us online. Also, if you do not accept cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience will be affected.
			<div class="spc20">&nbsp;</div>
			
			<b>d. Information Collected Using Pixel Tags or Clear GIFs.</b> To help us understand the effectiveness of certain of our email marketing efforts, Quamut.com or Quamut Wiki may use 
			"message format" and "message open" sensing technologies. Both technologies require the use of pixel tags or clear GIFs (also called web beacons). The "message format" sensing 
			technology allows us to recognize whether you have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails; if so, this information is then associated with your email address so that 
			subsequent messages can be sent to you in HTML format. The "message open" sensing technology allows us to recognize whether you have opened our email message. We can only detect 
			this if your have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails.
