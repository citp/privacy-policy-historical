# Privacy Policy | BrowserStack

_Effective from January 14, 2019  _

  1. #####  **Introduction.**

Your privacy is of paramount importance to BrowserStack, Inc. BrowserStack, Inc. and its affiliates are referred to collectively in this policy as as “ **BrowserStack** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ” or “ **our**.” Our affiliates are:

    * BrowserStack Inc. in the United States.
    * BrowserStack Limited in Ireland.
    * BrowserStack Software Pvt. Ltd. in India.

BrowserStack provides a cloud-based service (the “ **Service** ”), which is an automated testing platform for testing websites and mobile apps. We fully respect your right to privacy in relation to your interactions with the Service and are committed to being transparent in our dealings with you as to what personal information we will collect and how we will use your personal information. Also, we only collect and use personal information that is necessary for providing Service and where we have a lawful basis to do so.

We have operations in India, Ireland and in the United States. The location of BrowserStack’s main establishment in the European Union is Ireland and therefore we consider our lead supervisory authority, for purposes of “one stop shop” oversight over our cross-border data processing, to be the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (“ **DPC** ”).

Our European Union representative for purpose of this Privacy Policy is:

Nakul Aggarwal  
BrowserStack Limited  
8th Floor, Block E, Iveagh Court, Harcourt Road, Dublin 2 Ireland  
nakul@browserstack.com

We have created this Privacy Policy to describe our practices and procedures in handling “Personal Information” we collect or receive from you. The term “ **Personal Information** ” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an identified or identifiable living natural person, including but not limited to: (i) Identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, government identification card number, passport number, or other similar identifiers; and (ii) information defined as “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” “personal data,” or similar expressions under applicable privacy laws or data security Laws, which include the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (” **GDPR** ”).

This Privacy Policy covers two kinds of Personal Information: Account-Related Information and Personal Information collected by or in connection with the use of our website.

    * “ **Account-Related Information** ” means contact information, payment information, and biographical information about our customers’ representatives and contacts used for marketing, opening new user accounts to use BrowserStack’s Services, and to maintain existing accounts.
    * We collect various categories of Personal Information by or in connection with the use of our websites described in Section 3 below. Our websites include our main website and certain pages hosted by third parties on our behalf, such as pages to apply for jobs at BrowserStack.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. We will ask for your consent to be bound by this Privacy Policy as a condition of:

    * Allowing you to register for a BrowserStack account (an “ **Account** ”) on our website or any mobile application. Any users who use an Account will also be required to expressly accept this Privacy Policy before first accessing (or before continuing to access) our Service through Your Account. If you do not agree to these terms you must leave our website immediately, you must discontinue use of any use of our mobile application, and you will not be permitted to create an Account or use the Service. If you choose to accept this Privacy Policy, we will keep a record of your acceptance.
    * Submitting a web form to communicate with us or apply for a job on website pages we our vendors host on our behalf.

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover “Customer Content.” “ **Customer Content** ” means (i) data or content in a website or mobile application that a customer chooses to test (and for mobile applications, the application package itself); (ii) data a customer submits or creates as part of a test, including test scripts and screenshots; and (iii) any other data a customer submits to BrowserStack in connection with the use of the Services (not including Account-Related Information).

Customer Content does not fall within this Privacy Policy, because the Services are not designed for use with (and do not require) Personal Information included in Customer Content. In our agreements with customers, they specifically agree not to use the Services to collect, store, process or transmit any Personal Information other than Account-Related Information, and will not submit to the Services any Customer Content containing any Personal Information.

Our website and Services are intended for use by adults. We do not knowingly collect and Personal Information from users under 18 years of age.

  2. #####  **Privacy Shield Disclosures.**

BrowserStack complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. BrowserStack has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the principles of the Privacy Shield Framework (“ **Privacy Shield Principles** ”). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

BrowserStack’s commitments under the Privacy Shield Framework are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission.

Section 14 below discusses information about the specific independent dispute resolution body that is available to address complaints about BrowserStack’s privacy practices and to provide appropriate recourse free of charge to individuals.

  3. #####  **Types of Information We Collect.**

You must register an Account in order to use the Service. The registration process asks for Account-Related Information: a full name, password, email address, IP address, zip code and last four digits of your credit card (and address and contact details, which are optional). When you are running tests on BrowserStack, we log additional information like browser used, your latency to remote VM, your plan information, integration used, local, performance numbers etc. When you log into the Service, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type and settings, browser language, the address of the web page visited before using the Service, the date and time the Service was used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. (See the discussion of cookies in Section 3.) The legal bases upon which we process Account-Related Information is fulfillment of our contract to provide the Service to you and your consent.

Our websites collect certain Personal Information about visitors. For instance, through the use of cookies (discussed in Section 4), we are able to collect and analyze data about the use of our websites. See Section 4 for more detail. Also, when you submit a web form to communicate with us, we collect your name, email address, and whatever Personal Information you include in the webform’s fields. When you apply for a job using a web page with a job listing, we collect your name, email address, phone number, postal address, and whatever Personal Information you include in the “cover letter” field you provide or the resume you upload. We ask for consent for the use of cookies, and we ask for your consent to this Privacy Policy when submitting a communication or job application web form as the legal basis for processing the Personal Information communicated to us.

When you send a web form, email, or other communication to BrowserStack (other than in respect of Personal Information included in support requests), we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Service. When you submit a job application to BrowserStack, we will process the Personal Information you provide to us in connection with your candidacy for the job for which you applied. BrowserStack is a “data controller” under applicable data protection law with respect to the Personal Information covered by this Privacy Policy.

We may collect information from potential customers at trade shows or meetings, as well as information obtained by obtaining contact lists from marketing companies. The basis for receiving such information is the consent of the individual.

Note to California residents: BrowserStack does not currently have a mechanism to take action in response to a “do not track” signal or browser setting. There is no current standard way of handline such signals. If and when the industry creates standards for responding to them, BrowserStack will reappraise its handling of “do not track” signals.

We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information such as the number of sites, devices accessed while using BrowserStack, for example. Such information does not identify you individually.

We restrict access to Personal Information to employees, contractors, agents, and subcontractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our Service. These individuals and businesses are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, civil litigation, and/or criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Account-Related Information may be transferred to, stored at, or accessed from a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) for the purposes of us providing the Service. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, another corporate entity within our group, or any of our suppliers. By submitting Account-Related Information, you explicitly consent to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Account-Related Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. The safeguards in place with regard to the transfer of Account-Related Information outside of the EEA are the entry by us into appropriate contracts with all transferees of such data and/or assurance that the data importer is subject to a code of conduct or certification imposing reasonable and appropriate data protection safeguards.

We ask you not to share a password with any person not authorized to use the Service.

We implement reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect user privacy and protect Account-Related Information and other Personal Information. We restrict access to Account-Related Information and other Personal Information to employees, contractors, agents, and subcontractors that need to know such Personal Information in order to operate, develop or improve the Services that we provide. When we outsource any processes, we require the service provider to have reasonable and appropriate security measures in place.  
We will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by the processing of Account-Related Information and other Personal Information we collect. In particular, we will consider the risks presented by accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Account-Related Information and other Personal Information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will implement safeguards to protect Account-Related Information and other Personal Information we collect, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted us and any transmission of Account-Related Information is at your own risk. Once we have received your Personal Information, we will use security procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

We will notify serious data breaches in respect of Account-Related Information or other Personal Information as required by law without undue delay, A Personal Information breach in this context means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

    * details of the purpose for which it is being or is to be processed (see Section 5 above);
    * details of the recipients or classes of recipients to whom it is or may be disclosed, including if they are overseas and what protections are used for those oversea transfers (see Section 7 above);
    * details of the period for which it is held or the criteria we use to determine how long it is held (see Section 12 below);
    * details of your rights, including the rights to rectification, erasure, restriction or objection to the processing (set out in this Section 5);
    * any information available about the source of that data (see Section 1 above);
    * whether we carry out automated decision-making, or profiling, and where we do, information about the logic involved and the envisaged outcome or consequences of that decision making or profiling, although we do not currently carry out any profiling or use automated decision-making; and

Details in respect of the above points are all set out in this Privacy Policy; however, if you need further clarification, please contact us (see ‘How To Contact Us’ below).

Requests for your Personal Information must be made to us (see ‘How To Contact Us’ below) specifying what Personal Information you need access to, and a copy of such request may be kept by us for our legitimate purposes in managing the Service. To help us find the information easily, please give us as much information as possible about the type of information you would like to see. If, to comply with your request, we would have to disclose information relating to or identifying another person, we may need to obtain the consent of that person, if possible. If we cannot obtain consent, we may need to withhold that information or edit the data to remove the identity of that person, if possible.

There are certain types of data which we are not obliged to disclose to you, which include Personal Information which records our intentions in relation to any negotiations with you where disclosure would be likely to prejudice those negotiations. We are also entitled to refuse a data access request from you where (i) such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character (in this case, if we decide to provide you with the Personal Information requested, we may charge you a reasonable fee to account for administrative costs of doing so), or (ii) we are entitled to do so pursuant to data protection law.

You can require us to correct any mistakes in your Personal Information which we hold free of charge. If you would like to do this, please:

    * email or write to us (see ‘How can you contact us’ below);
    * let us have enough information to identify you (e.g. name, registration details); and
    * let us know the information that is incorrect and what it should be replaced with.

If we are required to update your Personal Information, we will inform recipients to whom that Personal Information have been disclosed (if any), unless this proves impossible or has a disproportionate effort.

It is your responsibility that all of the Personal Information provided to us is accurate and complete. If any information you have given us changes, please let us know as soon as possible (see ‘How To Contact Us’ below).

  10. #####  **Purpose Limitation.**

This may include retaining Account-Related Information or other Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services.
