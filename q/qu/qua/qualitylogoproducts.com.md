# Privacy Policy and Security Statement | FAQ | Quality Logo Products®

Let's be honest. Our fancy website, friendly sales team, and low prices are only part of the experience. While all of these are important and part of our mission, they're no match for the assurance that your information is safe with us, and that you'll be able to securely order your products.

When it comes to your privacy, we've taken the necessary steps to hopefully alleviate your concerns. So the only thing you have to worry about is ordering enough [pens](https://web.archive.org/pen-promotional.htm), [t-shirts](https://web.archive.org/custom-shirt-t.htm), [hats](https://web.archive.org/custom-hat.htm), or any other product for your customers!

### Privacy is Our Priority

We're partial to homemade chocolate chip cookies, but we wouldn't refuse an oatmeal raisin or white macadamia either! Oh...not those cookies? The less delicious version of cookies is information stored on your computer's hard drive, making it easier to recognize your location. 

There's no personally identifiable information collected from you if you visit our website and don't place an order. We do, however, store the zip code where your computer or device is located and remember searches you've done while surfing our website. Once you close the browser, all of that information will disappear since it isn't stored long term. Please note: we still have access to your IP address, which you can read more about below. 

A cookie is also created to store your searching history while you're on our website. This makes it easier to keep track of your product categories so you can find them again if you leave the page. Just remember, once you close your browser all of that information will be gone! 

If you happen to have found us through a third party website, such as Google or Yahoo, a cookie is created telling us what website you used. This is an easy way for us to know how people found our website, helping us create a better online experience for everyone! 

#### Always room for improvement!

Our developers are always improving things for our customers! We'll store your email address in a cookie if you submit information for a sample.

### What the Bubba is an IP Address?

An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a locator for devices connected to the Internet. Whether you're on a laptop, desktop, tablet, or mobile phone, every device has its own IP address. When you visit our website, we collect your device's IP address.

### Where You Are

Basically, the IP address lets us know the zip code that you're in when you search our website. We won't know your name, address, favorite color, or if you like to sing in the shower. Many web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) will also let us know you visited our website through their browser and tell us if you're on a computer or mobile device.

### Helps Fill Out Forms

The IP address helps us populate certain forms if you decide you want to place an order on the website. For instance, if your boss asked you to get those custom koozies yesterday, we'll be able to tell you how much it's going to cost to rush that shipment out based on your zip code.

### We Collect What We Need and Won't Share!

The only time we would collect personal information like your name, mailing address, phone number, and credit card information is when you're placing an order. We need this information because we want to make sure you get your products!

Quality Logo Products does NOT share your mailing address with any third party vendors, and at no time do we release your email address or telephone number to any outside parties. We transmit your credit card information to Authorize.net, a trusted secure payment processing company. We don't store credit card information on our servers.
