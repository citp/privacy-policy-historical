# Privacy Policy Statement Page - Quality Logo Products, Inc.

Concerned about privacy and security on the Internet?  
Quality Logo Products recognizes your concern. We want you to be able to place your order with us free of any worry. We have taken every precaution to protect your credit card information and want you to feel totally comfortable when you order from us.  
**  
Why is our Web site secure?  
**The SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the most powerful encryption available on the Internet. This means that any information related to your credit card is encrypted when being sent to us, so no one else is able to read it. You know that you are entering a secure area when the URL to the left of the colon changes from http to https. Also, your browser may have a special symbol, like a key or a lock.

Having a secure server takes the risk out of your credit card transactions. We also do all order processing on software that is separate from the Internet, so there is no danger of anyone gaining access to your order information. We will keep your credit card information on file for futures ordering convenience, but only if you authorize us to do so. If you don’t, it will be destroyed as soon as your order has been completed (your credit card information is not stored in electronic format). 

Your credit card purchases are, as always, insured by your credit card company. If, in an extremely rare case, confirmed credit card fraud would occur, your card issuer would limit your liability to $50. To show you that Quality Logo Products is committed to the security of our Web site, we would take care of the $50 that you would be responsible for. This means there is absolutely no risk to you. We want you to feel totally at ease every time you visit our site to get information, request a sample and place an order.

**Please note that email is not encrypted and not considered a secure way to transmit your credit card information.

If you still do not feel comfortable about leaving your credit card information on our secured Web site, please contact one of our customer care representatives at 866-312-5646 and they’ll be happy to help you with your order.

Your Other Information  
When you visit our Web site, we automatically recognize some information about you, including your Internet service provider. We don’t automatically recognize your name, address, email address or any other information specific to you, unless you give us that information via our online registration. Our web site technology allows us to keep track of how many times a user visits our site and what features they use, but it does not collect any personably identifiable information. The information we do collect helps us to make sure that our site is meeting yours and other customers’ needs.

Quality Logo Products does NOT share your mailing address with any third party vendors and at no time does Quality Logo Products release your email address or telephone number to any outside parties.
