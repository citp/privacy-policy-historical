# Privacy Policy

                                     Privacy Policy
QuaverMusic.com (“QuaverMusic.com”) is operated and presented to users in all locations by
Mastran Music Group, Inc., a Tennessee corporation d/b/a Quaver’s Marvelous World of Music.
This Privacy Policy describes the information practices of the QuaverMusic.com website (www.
QuaverMusic.com), including how we collect, use, and disclose personal information.
We are dedicated to safeguarding any personal information collected on the QuaverMusic.com
website. Accordingly, this privacy policy is provided to you in conformity with the Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). COPPA requires that we notify parents and legal
guardians and obtain consent from parents and legal guardians before we collect, use, and/or
disclose personal information from children under thirteen years of age.
1. What types of information do we collect?
     As described in this Privacy Policy, we directly collect from child users during our initial
     registration process a parent’s email address, the child’s account name, and the child’s
     password. When a QuaverMusic.com child registrant acquires a paid membership, we
     may collect additional personally identifiable information (hereinafter sometimes
     referred to as “Personal Information”) from the registrant’s parent. The types of Personal
     Information that may be collected at that time include the parent’s full name, e-mail
     address, and credit card billing information including mailing address. The QuaverMusic.
     com website does not condition a child’s participation in an online activity on the child
     providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.
     The QuaverMusic.com website requires child users to provide a parent’s valid e-mail
     address in order to register on the website. We use this information to send the parent
     a message that can be used to activate the QuaverMusic.com account, to notify the
     parent about our privacy practices, to send the parent communications either about the
     parent’s and child’s QuaverMusic.com accounts or about features of our website, and for
     the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This email address is correlated with
     the account user name.
     We may also request a user name and e-mail address when a user submits a form through
     the “Contact Us” portion of the QuaverMusic.com website so that we may respond to the
     inquiry. We collect the e-mail address for the sole purpose of responding directly on a
     one-time basis to a specific inquiry.
     For some of our online activities - such as polls or surveys - we may ask users to provide
     information that is not personally identifiable, such as country of residence or a visitor’s
     favorite music. We also enable users to chat online through our website, but we take
     measures so that users cannot communicate personal information through this chat
     function. These measures include filters and live moderation. Nevertheless, if you use the
     chat function within this website and disclose personally identifiable information, you
     should be aware that such information could be read, collected, or used by other users.
                                              Page 1 of 3                                    QP080111.1


   We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit
   through the chat function. Finally, we may offer blogs or other Public Forums (as defined
   in the Terms of Use governing the website (the “Terms of Use”), as well as other features
   in which you may provide us with Submissions (as defined in the Terms of Use), but we
   take measures, including live moderation, so that users cannot communicate personal
   information through these Public Forums. If you use a Public Forum on this website, and
   disclose personally identifiable information, you should be aware that such information
   could be read, collected, or used by other users. We are not responsible for the personally
   identifiable information you choose to submit in these Public Forums.
   Additionally, when visitors come to our site, we may passively collect certain non-
   personally identifiable computer information, such as the type of computer operating
   system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the user’s IP Address, the web browser (e.g.,
   Netscape, Internet Explorer) being used, the frequency with which guests visit various
   parts of our sites, and information regarding the Internet service provider, in order to
   continue to improve our sites and for various purposes related to our business. We
   may collect this non-personally identifiable information through the use of software
   technologies such as unique identifiers or “cookies.” Cookies are small text files that we
   place in visitors’ computer browsers to store their preferences. You can choose to have
   your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all
   cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer)
   settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn
   the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to
   many features that make your Web experience smoother, and some of our services may
   not function properly.
   Finally, we collect financial information as set out in Section 5 of this Privacy Policy. We
   do not use this financial information for any purpose other than processing payments to
   QuaverMusic.com. The financial information that you enter to purchase a membership
   is not stored by QuaverMusic.com; instead it is retained by our payments processing
   vendor for the purpose of processing credit card payments made to QuaverMusic.com.
   If personal information is not provided to us, then QuaverMusic.com may not agree to
   QuaverMusic.com membership and may not be able to provide access to certain content
   and functionality on the QuaverMusic.com website, or to provide other information,
   products, or services which may be requested.
2. How do we use your personal information?
   In addition to the purposes described in Section 1, we may actively collect and use e-mail
   addresses and user names to track usage and to ensure users are following the site’s
   Terms of Use. In addition, we may use an e-mail address and user name to ban a user
   temporarily or permanently from the QuaverMusic.com website if that user engages in
   inappropriate conduct on the site. We may also use e-mail addresses and user names to
   enable parents to review Personal Information that the children have submitted to the
   QuaverMusic.com website and to provide notification regarding the site, such as any
   future amendments to this Privacy Policy. We also may use information in the aggregate
   to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.
   We may disclose information where we are required to do so by law, for example, in
   response to a court order or a subpoena or where we disclose information to service
   providers or other group companies who provide support for the operations of our
   website and who do not use or disclose the information for any other purpose. To
   the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose Personal Information in
   response to a law enforcement agency’s or other public agency’s (including schools or
                                              Page 2 of 3                                   QP080111.1


     children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of
     a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety, or protect the safety of a child
     using our website, protect the security or integrity of our website, or enable us to take
     precautions against liability.
     If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of our assets or are otherwise
     involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer Personal Information to a
     third party as part of that transaction, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Finally,
     we may transfer Personal Information and store it outside of the jurisdiction in which a
     member of QuaverMusic.com is located.
3. Do we ever disclose your personal information that we collect from
    children to third parties?
     We do not allow third-party companies to solicit or advertise to our users. Our intention
     is to keep QuaverMusic.com free from any of this sort of direct advertising.
4. How do we secure Personal Information?
     The security of your personal information is important to us. We have put in place
     appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help
     prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information
     we collect online.
