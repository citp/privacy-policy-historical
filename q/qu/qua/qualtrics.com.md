A recent ruling in the European Court of Justice has essentially placed the Safe Harbor framework on hold. Subsequently, the protection of trans-Atlantic data was in question. And on February 2, 2016, a new version of Safe Harbor was revealed: EU-US Privacy Shield. While waiting for this updated agreement to be accepted, Qualtrics’ position is to continue using industry best methods to protect all customer data, and is presently investigating the new developments in the privacy realm.
