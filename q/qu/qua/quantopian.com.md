# Privacy Policy

Quantopian is both a platform and a community. It's a place to write and test trading algorithms. It's a place to meet other algorithm writers, to share algorithms, ideas, strategies, and trading experiences. Quantopian, Inc.

If you simply browse the Site, you are referred to in this Privacy Policy as a "**Visitor**."

### 5\. Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites

We have created and may offer you interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking websites such as Facebook ("**SN Site**") through our Site. We will work with the SN Site’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that SN Site on your behalf. In order to provide this authorization, you will not provide us with your user name or password to the SN Site, but you will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site. Once authorized by you, the SN Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SN Site, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide you.
