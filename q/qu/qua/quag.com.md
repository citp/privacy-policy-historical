### Quag - Data Protection Policy Statement

#### Company Information

The services mentioned and described in this document are made available and provided by Quentral Srl (hereinafter Quentral), with registered office in Via Durini, 27, 20122 Milan (MI) - VAT no.: 06383360960, registered with Companies House of the Chamber of Commerce of Milan no. REA 1888893, the owner of the web application and Quag.com brand and Controller of the personal data provided by users of Quag.com.

For any questions regarding these data protection regulations, users may send an e-mail to the following address: [privacy@quag.com](mailto:privacy@quag.com)

#### Intent and purpose of data processing

Defined in this statement are the criteria and procedures used by Quentral for processing the personal data provided upon registration with Quag.com and/or published on Quag.com by registered users. 

Processing of personal data, in accordance with art. 4, letter a) of Legislative Decree 196/2003, is defined as any operation or set of operations concerning the registration, organisation, storage, consultation, processing, modification, selection, extraction, comparison, use, interconnection, blocking, communication, transmission, cancellation and destruction of personal data.

Therefore, in this section, Quentral intends to illustrate the ways in which the information provided by users when registering and creating their profile on Quag.com will be collected and used, as well as any other information that Quentral acquires as a result of use of the service by all users, both registered and public. Public users are defined as those users who have not yet registered their profile, but who may nonetheless use some of the functions of the application, such as, for example, the search function.

The information provided by users, such as the information required for the registration of a Quag.com account, may be used by Quentral to improve the user experience, for example, by allowing users to receive e-mail notifications regarding the Quag.com service. 

We invite all users to read the detailed Statement that follows. In order to complete the registration process on Quag.com and to use the services offered to registered users, said users must give their consent to the processing of their personal data, pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 196/2003.

Users give their consent by creating an account and/or by accessing the site. We nonetheless urge users to carefully read this document and the documents relating to the [Terms and Condition](https://web.archive.org/en/page/terms/ "Terms and condition") of Use of the Service.

After completing the registration process on Quag.com, registered users may access Member Services and publish content within their personal online profile (including, but not limited to, images, a list of their interests, their gender, nationality, etc.). Such content shall be added voluntarily and at the sole discretion of users, based on their own personal choices and under their exclusive responsibility.

We also wish to inform users – inviting them to take due account of this aspect before making any decision regarding the following – that, by publishing content on the website, they may, even unconsciously provide and disclose additional personal information. The publication of said content (and any personal information that may result or emerge from this content, directly or indirectly) is, in any case, a personal choice freely made by users, entirely of their own volition, with regard to which Quentral is totally extraneous and for which it declines all liability; such choices are made exclusively under the personal responsibility of the user concerned.

#### Data collected

Upon registration, Quag.com asks users for their personal and identification data, i.e. e-mail address and a password that will become the password to access the service; we remind users that they can also register with Quag.com using their facebook or twitter profile. By clicking on one of the buttons linked to the social networks in the registration/access window of Quag.com, users will be redirected to the login page of the selected social network, through which, after entering the proper credentials, they will be registered automatically on Quag.com. The registration process cannot be completed without this information and thus users will not be able to become registered users of Quag.com, and it will not be possible for them to use the services Quag.com reserves for its members (for more details about Quag.com services, we recommend reading the [Terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/en/page/terms/ "Terms and conditions") of Use of the Service).

As part of providing its service, Quentral also collects information on which and how services are used by its users, both registered and public (not registered). 

This information includes:

    1. **Information on the device used:** we may collect specific information about the devices used by users to connect to the Quag.com service, (e.g. hardware model, type and version, operating system, browser type and language setting).

    2. **Log information:** ******the** log file is a file in which the actions users make during their Quag.com service session are recorded. ****When users access our services, we collect and store certain information automatically in server logs. This information includes:

      * Data on how the service is being used, such as search queries _,_ the date and time of requests and the URLs that are part of the Quag.com service, data produced by sessions that use social network functions. 

      * The computer's IP address.

      * Information about device events, such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type and language.

#### Use of the data collected

Quentral uses the data collected to enable the registration of users on the Quag.com website, to offer its services, to monitor the use of the website, to test the efficiency of the security procedures, to verify compliance with the [Terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/en/page/terms/ "Terms and conditions") of Use of the Service, to improve them constantly, and, in this way, to make the users' experience of the service as engaging and enjoyable as possible. All this is carried out while maintaining the protection and privacy of users as our top priority. The information collected by Quentral is used to enable full use of the features and services provided, as well as to provide users with content and information as close as possible to their tastes and preferences. By way of example, by identifying users' areas of interest, it will be possible to contact other users with similar interests.
