**Tracking Technologies**

_Cookies_

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do/do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

Cookies offer users many conveniences when browsing our website. We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

Persistent cookies are used to retain certain personal preferences that users may have. For example the background colour of the website can be changed, thus whatever colour the user chooses, this setting will be saved for the next visit. We also set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.  Persistent cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

The use of cookies by our service providers is not covered by our privacy statement.  We do not have access or control over these cookies. 

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited.

_Log Files_

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

**Links to Other Web Sites   **  
Our Site includes links to other web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Kozzi. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any web site you visit.

We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices.
