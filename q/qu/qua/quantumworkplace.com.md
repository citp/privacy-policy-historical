# Privacy Policy | Quantum Workplace

Quantum Workplace is committed to the highest standard of privacy. This includes the privacy of individuals and organizations that take our surveys (survey respondents), individuals who use our Employee Feedback Platform (users), and individuals who visit Quantum Workplace’s websites (visitors). This privacy policy explains how Quantum Workplace handles personal and company data for those using our services and tools.

### Survey Respondents

Quantum Workplace protects the privacy of individuals taking our employee surveys, Best Places to Work surveys, and research surveys. We will not share, sell, rent, swap, or authorize any third party to use survey respondents' email addresses for commercial purposes. Our surveys are strictly confidential. Our business depends upon confidential survey feedback, and we do everything we can to protect the individuals and organizations that take our surveys.

###### Employee Surveys

We will not in any way reprint, resell, or redistribute your organization’s survey results to anyone, with the exception of Best Places to Work surveys, in which case results are shared with the event’s sponsoring publication.

Access to your organization’s results is available to selected leaders within your organization who use the information for organizational development purposes. Organizational data may be sliced by employee demographics, but will never identify individual employees or employee groups with fewer than five employees.

When our surveys ask for demographic information, it is for benchmarking purposes and to allow employers to view aggregate results by age, department, gender, etc. However, if a demographic has fewer than five people, employers will not be able to see the results. For example, if an employer wanted to see the results of ONLY the marketing department, but the marketing department has fewer than five employees, employers wouldn’t be able view the results of this demographic. This is how we keep survey responses confidential.

For population and pulse surveys, employers will NOT have access to:

  * Employee names or email addresses – a survey cannot be tracked to a specific person
  * The ability to see who has or has not completed the survey
  * A specific employee’s answers



For self-evaluation surveys, such as an exit interview or new hire surveys, employers WILL have access to:

  * The ability to see if the self evaluator (exiter or new hire) has completed the survey
  * A specific self evaluator’s (exiting or new employee’s) answers



Quantum Workplace reserves the right to aggregate your data into comparative benchmarks that are presented to our clients or third parties. Under all circumstances, your organization’s data will be combined with multiple organizations, and your organization’s identity will never be revealed.

###### Best Places to Work

In addition to the policies listed above in Employee Surveys, Quantum Workplace also maintains the following policies when operating Best Places to Work surveys.

Quantum Workplace reserves the right to share Best Places to Work organizations’ information with the sponsoring publication to establish honorees and awards. If your organization is not an honoree, your results will not be shared.

All participating Best Places to Work organizations will receive a one-page overview report after participating in the contest. This report will show the overall score and a few specific highlights from the survey. Employers also have the option to purchase a more advanced report that will contain all survey results and comments. However, answers are always shown at the aggregate level (grouped together).

###### Research Surveys

We will not in any way reprint, resell, or redistribute an individual’s survey response or an organization’s results to anyone. Data we collect for research is always published and distributed in aggregate.

Quantum Workplace reserves the right to aggregate your data into comparative benchmarks that are presented to our clients or third parties. Under all circumstances, your data and your organization’s data will be combined with multiple organizations, and neither identity will be revealed.

When our surveys ask for demographic information, it is for benchmarking purposes and to allow our research studies to examine aggregate results by age, department, gender, etc.
