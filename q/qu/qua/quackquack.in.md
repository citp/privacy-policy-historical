**What information does Quackquack.in collect/track about me**

Quackquack's sole purpose is to assist you in finding your companion securely and privately. Whether you are seeking friendship, social networking, a casual or a serious relationship, Quackquack is here to help you.

To accomplish the above purpose, our members create unique profiles (provide personal information) and our matching technology provides matches based on pre-selected criteria.

The public (visitors, other members, or anyone not employed by Quackquack.in or the financial institutions used to process membership charges) cannot use the information we gather to identify specific individuals.

Further, in order to facilitate commerce, we collect credit card information, member's address, or bank information only from those who choose to join Quackquack.in. Visitors to our site may browse, search and view articles or features without entering any personal information.

**Quackquack.in** gathers two types of information. Information members submit to us and information not directly submitted by members.
