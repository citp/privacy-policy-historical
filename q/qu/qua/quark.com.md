We will never knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without first obtaining verifiable parental consent. If it comes to our attention that a customer under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, we will remove all such information from our files. However, we may still maintain a record of that person’s name and address in a “do not register” file in order to avoid a subsequent registration.
