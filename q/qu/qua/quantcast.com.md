We may also request additional Personally Identifiable Information from time to time thereafter. Providing such additional Personally Identifiable Information is entirely optional, although some Quantcast.com Site features may not work without it.


  * For Quantcast Clients, we use your Personally Identifiable Information mainly to provide the Services to you, as applicable, and to administer your inquiries. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you with Quantcast newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.



### Registered Users

  * If you do not have a website that you want to measure, but you do want to access or use certain information, content, or tools on the Quantcast.com Site or receive our newsletter or other marketing materials and information, you may be required to register and to submit certain Personally Identifiable Information to us. This includes user name, password, email address, physical address, and telephone number, as well as any other information that you decide to provide us with. Your profile information and your name may be displayed in the Quantcast network to enable you to connect with other people on the network, as specified by you in your privacy settings.

### Quantcast Tags

“ **Quantcast Tags** ” (a.k.a. Web Beacons or Pixel Tags) are tiny graphics, used in conjunction with cookies to help us gather Log Data. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Tags are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by Quantcast Tags to the personally identifiable information of visitors to a Web site.

### Log Data

  * “ **Log Data** ” means information sent by your browser such as pixel code, referring HTTP location, current HTTP location, search string, time of the access, browser’s time, any searches made on the applicable website, and other statistics. We do not store full IP addresses.
  * We retain Log Data for 13 months to accommodate seasonality.
  * When you visit the Quantcast.com Site, whether as a Quantcast Client, Registered User or Quantcast Visitor, our servers automatically record and collect Log Data sent by your browser. We use the Log Data to monitor and analyze the use of the Quantcast.com Site and the Services, for the Quantcast.com Site’s technical administration, to increase the Quantcast.com Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Quantcast.com Site again, it will recognize you and will be able to serve content, advertisements, and other information appropriate to your interests.
  * We also collect Log Data each time you visit third-party websites serving content that has been tagged by Quantcast Clients with Quantcast Tags. We analyze Log Data from different websites and combine it with other non Personally Identifiable Information to produce the Reports that are made available on the Quantcast.com Site, and to enable web publishers and advertisers to deliver audience segments that are appropriate for their products or services. This combined data is also used by us and our partners to serve you content, advertisements, and other information tailored to your interests.
  * Our clients use our Market Research Services to understand their current and historical audience characteristics.
  * We do not link Log Data to any other Personally Identifiable Information about you or otherwise attempt to discover your identity. We make efforts to require our Quantcast Clients to ensure that any such third party website post adequate privacy policies and otherwise protect the privacy rights of their visitors. Check the privacy policies of websites tagged with Quantcast Tags for information regarding the applicable privacy practices.

We also use cookies when you visit websites with content tagged by Quantcast Clients with Quantcast Tags, to collect Log Data, as described in the Log Data section above. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting browser cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use all portions of the Quantcast.com Site or all functionality of the Services.

After you opt-out, you will not receive interest based content and advertisements enabled by Quantcast and we will not log your pattern of website visits or other online media consumption. Please note that opting-out does not turn off other advertisements or other ad delivery solutions (non-Quantcast) that address advertising based on demographic, interests, or other forms of audience based data.
