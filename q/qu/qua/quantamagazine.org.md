You may opt out of marketing-related emails by following the instructions contained at the bottom of our emails, or by contacting us at privacy@simonsfoundation.org. You may continue to receive service-related and other nonmarketing emails. 

### Online behavioral advertising

Some of the partners that collect information about users’ activities on our websites may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding targeted advertising. Users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking [here](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/), selecting the user’s country, and then clicking “Choices” (or similarly titled link). If you choose to opt out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online, but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed. 

### “Do Not Track” signals

Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not honor “Do Not Track” signals. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

We will tell you what information you must provide to receive our services by designating it as required or through other appropriate means. 

## Security

We take a number of organizational, technical and physical measures designed to protect the personal information we collect, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no security safeguards are 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information. 

### **Children**

Our websites are not intended for children under 16. If you become aware that a child has provided us with information without parental or guardian consent, please [contact us](mailto:privacy@simonsfoundation.org). We will delete such information from our files as soon as reasonably practicable.

European Union users should read the important information provided in our [Institutional Privacy Policy](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/sf-privacy-policy/) about transfer of personal information outside of the European Economic Area.

Our websites may contain links to other websites and services. These links are not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party. We do not exercise control over third-party websites or services, and are not responsible for their actions. Other websites and services may follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites you visit and services you use.
