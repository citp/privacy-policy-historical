We keep your data for the period required to complete the activities for which it was gathered, but no longer than the limit stipulated by the applicable legislation.

In order to provide our services effectively, we may need to subcontract some tasks, in whole or in part, to technical subcontractors with whom we have entered into contracts (e.g. the subcontractors responsible for maintaining our infrastructure, IT security, hosting, marketing tools, helpdesk and others).

Qualifio requires its subcontractors to adhere to data protection legislation and to submit satisfactory guarantees on the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures. They are required to demonstrate that their processing system complies with current data protection legislation and that your rights are guaranteed.

We do not sell or in any way disclose to third parties the data that we gather about you. However, if we have a legal obligation, or if a court ruling requires us to do so, we shall pass on your data to the extent necessary to comply with this law or court ruling.

Under certain circumstances, our website and our apps will provide you with plug-ins for various social networks. If you choose to interact with social network sites such as Facebook or Twitter (for example by setting up an account), your activity on our site or via our apps will also be accessible on that social network site. If you are logged onto one of these social network sites during your visit to any of our sites or apps, or if you interact with any of the social network plug-ins, the social network site may also add this information to your profile on that network, depending on your privacy protection settings. If you want to prevent this type of data transfer, please log off your social network site before logging on to any of our sites or apps, or change the app privacy protection settings, if possible. Please read these social networks’ own privacy protection policies for further details on the collection and transmission of personal data, on your rights, and on how you can achieve a satisfactory degree of privacy protection.

We have introduced appropriate technical and organisational security rules designed to avoid the destruction, loss, falsification, amendment, unauthorised access to or accidental disclosure of data to third parties, together with any unauthorised processing of the data.

Qualifio can never be held liable for harm deemed to be indirect such as, without this list being exhaustive, loss of data, financial or commercial loss, loss of profits, increased general costs, or disruption of planning or scheduling.

Moreover, Qualifio cannot be held liable for any harm arising from any unlawful manipulation of the data by third parties, such as data theft, introduction of viruses, hacking or any other IT malpractices.

We should also highlight the fact that links to our website may contain hypertext links and other references to other sites that we do not manage or control, to which these provisions do not apply. We are not responsible for the content of such websites or the offers, products or services that they contain. We recommend that you carefully read the privacy protection rules of each site that you visit, as those rules may differ from the rules set out here.
