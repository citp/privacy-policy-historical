# Privacy Policy - Quote Roller

**Information privacy**

Quote Roller maintains reasonable security measures to protect your information from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. This helps to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access.

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not and will not sell your personal information to third parties.

Unfortunately no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure due to the nature of the distributed network that is the Internet, and Quote Roller, Inc. is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from data gathered by unauthorized access to our Services from hacking, social engineering, or otherwise circumventing our security measures.

 **Billing information**

We process all credit card transactions using secure SSL encryption. Leading banks commonly use the same level of encryption. Card information is transmitted, stored, and processed securely on a PCI-Compliant network.
