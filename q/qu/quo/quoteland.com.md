Quoteland.com, DoubleClick and its advertisers are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.

**Consumer Information**

During the process of delivering an ad to you, Quoteland does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address.

If this does occur, Quoteland may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, Quoteland may combine this information with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.
