<strong>TheQuoteWizard.com Web Privacy Statement</strong>
<p></p>
<em>This privacy policy was last updated on June 19th, 2006 </em>
<p></p>
TheQuoteWizard is committed to protecting your private information. This Privacy Statement describes the information that we collect when you visit one of our sites. It also describes how we use that information, and how you can update it. We reserve the right to append or otherwise modify this Privacy Statement at any time. Please re-visit this page occasionally to check for updates. 
<p></p>
<strong>Information We Collect</strong>
<p></p>
Collecting various types of information from our visitors allows TheQuoteWizard to periodically adjust our site to meet our users' needs and expectations. Some of this information is collected automatically, through cookies. Other information is collected when you register for any of our online services, or when you request information from one of our insurance partners. 
<p></p>
<strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong>
<p></p>
Some information is automatically sent to TheQuoteWizard by your browser or Internet session each time you visit one of our sites. These types of information include: 
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>The name of your browser, e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator.</li>
	<li>Your Internet domain, e.g., AOL, Netcom, Earthlink, etc.</li> 
	<li>You computer's operating system, e.g., Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, Linux. </li>
	<li>Your navigation path, e.g., the URL(s) that you use to access our site, which of our pages you visit, and where you go when you leave. </li>
	<li>Your IP address. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
This information allows us to see how users are finding our sites, and which pages are visited the most often. We can then use this information to make our web sites more useful and more user-friendly. 
<p></p>
<strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong>
<p></p>
In addition to the information automatically collected by your browser, TheQuoteWizard also collects information that you provide to us when you request quote information. 
<p></p>
Our web sites provide users with the opportunity to request quote information from insurance providers and brokers. To do this, we collect contact information (name, address, phone number, email address, gender, age, work experience, etc.) as well as information relevant to the applicant's insurability (driver history, vehicle usage, etc). This contact information is then provided to the insurance partners from which the user has requested quote information.
<p></p>
TheQuoteWizard uses cookies to store contact information for each user. If the user uses our site to make further requests for quote information, their contact information will automatically be used to pre-populate contact forms. TheQuoteWizard also collects customer interest information (e.g. Requests for E-Mail Newsletters) to determine what information the customer wishes to be sent after using our service. 
<p></p>
<strong>How We Use This Information</strong>
<p></p>
The information that is automatically collected by our web site allows TheQuoteWizard to further develop and improve the layout, design, and usability of the site, in order to better serve your Internet needs. Information you provide to us is used for marketing purposes, and may result in follow-up communications. 
<p></p>
TheQuoteWizard may share personally identifiable information with third-party businesses for the purpose of direct marketing, specifically e-mail marketing. All third parties are bound by the CAN SPAM Act (s.877) of 2003, and are required to be in full compliance of all consumer opt-out rules and regulations. 
<p></p>
<strong>Your Rights -- Our Obligations </strong>
<p></p>
The company respects the privacy of users visiting our sites and will abide by all applicable laws concerning the release of personal information. On occasion, we may use certain directory information that we collect from you to send you information about products and services, or updates and other information that we think may be of interest to you. We may share this information with our insurance partners to bring similar information to your attention. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. Please contact us to request that your name and address should be removed from our lists. If you do not want to receive our e-mail marketing, please submit a request to have your e-mail address removed by e-mailing: unsubscribe@TheQuoteWizard.com. 
<p></p>
Other than directory information, the data that you provide to us as you use the web site will be held in strict confidence by the company, and will be used for company purposes only.
<p></p>
<strong>Our Security Measures</strong>
<p></p>
Our web sites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and/or alteration of the information under our control. 
<p></p>
<strong>Why We Use "Cookies" </strong>
<p></p>
When you visit some of our sites, we use cookies to keep track of your information. A "cookie" is a small piece of program code that resides on your computer and stores your contact information for all of our "Request Information" sites. Each time you visit our site, the cookie uses the stored information to pre-populate our online forms, so that you do not have to re-enter your contact information as you move from one site to another. 
<p></p>
<strong>Links From Our Site To Other Sites</strong> 
<p></p>
Some of our sites may contain links to other sites external to our sites. When you access these external web sites, the providers of the sites will have access to certain information about you. TheQuoteWizard is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any web sites which we do not directly control. 
<p></p>
<strong>Definitions</strong>
<p></p>
<strong>Cookies</strong>
<p></p>
Data created by a web server that is stored on a user's computer. A cookie provides a way for the web site to keep track of a user's patterns and preferences and, with the cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user's own hard disk. 
<p></p>
The cookies contain a range of URLs (web addresses) for which they are valid. When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to the Web server. For example, if a user's ID is stored as a cookie, it saves that person from typing in the same information all over again when accessing that service for the second and subsequent time during the same browser session. 
<p></p>
You can opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the Options or Preferences menu. 
<p></p>
<strong>IP (Internet Protocol) Address</strong>
<p></p>
This is the address of a computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client and server station must have a unique IP address. Client workstations have either a permanent address or one that is dynamically assigned for each dial-up session. IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by periods; for example, 204.171.64.2. 
<p></p>
<strong>Browser Session</strong>
<p></p>
A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser is in consecutive use. The session begins when you open the browser and ends when you close it. When you re-open the browser, you begin a new session. 
<p></p>
<strong>SSL Encryption (Secure Sockets Layer)</strong>
<p></p>
The leading security protocol on the Internet. When an SSL session is started, the browser sends its public key to the server so that the server can securely send a secret key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data via secret key encryption during that session. TheQuoteWizard also uses SSL encryption whenever we display your personal information (e.g., name and address, scheduled courses, grades). 
<p></p>
<strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</strong>
<p></p>
An Internet address. URLs are used to locate sites on the Internet and to navigate between sites and pages within sites. The URL for TheQuoteWizard is www.TheQuoteWizard.com.
