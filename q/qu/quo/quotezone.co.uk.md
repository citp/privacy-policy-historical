##### 1 What this Privacy Policy applies to

This policy applies to the information about yourself that you choose to provide us with or that you allow us to collect. This includes:

  * information you provide during any quote process, such as your name, your age and your contact details;
  * information you provide when you enter prize draws, competitions or provide reviews;
  * information which we may obtain about you from third parties (for example, because you have given third parties permission to share that information with us);
  * information we collect about how you use the website.



##### 2 Our obligations

We are a data controller in relation to the information that you provide us with. As a result, we are legally responsible for how that information is handled.

We will comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 in the way we use and share your personal data. Among other things, this means that we will only use your personal data:

  * fairly and lawfully,
  * as set out in the legislation and this policy,
  * to the extent necessary for these purposes.



We may process your personal data ourselves or through data processors who will process data on our behalf. If we use data processors we will remain responsible for ensuring that they comply with this policy and data protection law.

We will take every reasonable precaution to safeguard the personal information that you supply.

If you have any requests concerning your personal information or any queries about our privacy policy, website or service, please contact us using the details given below in the Contacting us section.

##### 3 Use of your information

If you provide us with your information through this website, for instance by filling in one of the forms requesting us to compare insurance quotes, we shall use your information as set out in this privacy policy and in the notices we provide when you submit your information. By submitting your personal information, you consent to our use of the information as set out in this privacy policy and such notices. You will be able to withdraw that consent at any time by the methods described in this Privacy Policy.

In particular, we may need to collect your sensitive personal information to allow us to provide you with quotes, for instance information relating to criminal convictions or to your health. You consent to our use of such information for the purposes set out below.

If you give us your personal information, we will use it to provide you with the quote comparison information you request. We may also from time to time contact you by mail, telephone, SMS, or email to provide information that may be of interest to you, including our newsletter, special offers and details about the services we offer. If for any reason you do not want to receive any marketing communications from us then you can unsubscribe by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/contact-quotezone.htm) and then you can use the unsubscribe service on the contact us page. You can use that unsubscribe option at any time. If you initially decide to accept marketing e-mails from us but then change your mind you can always use the unsubscribe link in our marketing e-mails.

We advise you that insurance providers exchange information through various databases, including the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE), which holds a record of incidents reported to insurers by policyholders and third party claimants. This information exchange enables insurers to validate the information provided by you, both about yourself and any other person named on the application, and aims to reduce fraudulent claims. Insurers may use this information to consider the risk of your application.

If you provide us with your driving licence number (‘DLN’) via our quote form we may pass this information to the DVLA in order for a search to be carried out to confirm your (or any named driver’s) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Carrying out these searches help insurers validate your information, preventing fraud and reducing incidents of negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure. DLN searches may be carried out as part of your quote or at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy. These searches will not appear on your (or the named driver’s) driving licence record. You can find details of the information that the DVLA currently hold about you at [www.dvla.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency).

Some insurance providers who offer products designed for students or graduates may also undertake additional checks against higher education sources to verify your student or graduate status.

By submitting your personal information, you agree that we may for the purposes set out above disclose your information to our agents and service providers, some of which may be located outside the European Economic Area in countries providing less protection for personal data than the UK.

##### 4.2.3 Combining data

Where you have consented to us passing your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, the information you give us may be combined by those third parties with other information about you that is obtained from other sources.

  * If you are already a customer of a third party, that third party might wish to add an e-mail address you give us to the customer records that it holds about you, and use that email address to maintain their relationship with you and/or to offer you goods and services that are similar to those you have previously purchased.
  * The data you provide here may be combined with data you have provided elsewhere to verify your identity or validate the information you have provided (for example in the context of a third party’s anti-fraud measures.
  * If you have given any third parties permission to share your information, or if you sign in through a social medium, those third parties may be able to find and use information about you so that, in order to speed up the registration process or offer you tailored advertising, you don’t have to provide the information directly to us. The information we obtain will be used in accordance with the other parts of this privacy policy.



The consent you provided for any information you have previously shared with us or any third parties will be renewed at the time you give your consent for any new information sharing unless you indicate otherwise by contacting us, by e-mailing us at [info@quotezone.co.uk](mailto:info@quotezone.co.uk).

##### 4.2.4 Analysis and derivative data products

Sometimes your data will be used for analysis purposes or to build data products. In these instances, the information is aggregated and wherever possible anonymised in line with the Information Commissioners code of practice. Again, these products are of a marketing nature.

##### 4.2.5 Security

All third party users of your data are required to adopt and implement best practice security measures to prevent the loss of or unauthorised access to your personal information.

This information includes a quotation search from a credit referencing agency. This search will appear on your credit report and will be visible to other credit providers. It will be clear that this is a quotation rather than a credit application by you to pay by monthly instalments.
