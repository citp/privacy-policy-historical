In order to provide you with a quote we may need to collect personal information which data protection legislation defines as special categories data, such as medical history or criminal convictions. We may also need to share this data with providers to enable them to generate their quotes for you. We may process this data because it is in the substantial public interest to do so for the purposes of arranging and/or advising on contracts of insurance.

### 5 The legal basis for processing your personal information

Data protection law says that we are allowed to use personal information only if we have a proper reason to do so such as consent or legitimate interests.

Our grounds for processing your personal information are as follows:

 **1\. Consent** – Where we rely on this legal basis, we will collect and process your personal information only if you have given your consent for us to do so, for example, we will only send you certain marketing emails where you have agreed to this.

You can withdraw your consent at any time. Please contact us if you want to do so.

 **2\. Legitimate Interests** \- A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information. But even then, it must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you. We may use and process some of your personal information where we have legitimate business grounds for doing so. We have carried out a legitimate interest assessment in respect of each processing activity for which legitimate interest is our lawful basis. Our legitimate interests for processing your personal information are:

  * 2.1in relation to certain aspects of our services: the use of data processors in respect to the provision of the services (as described at section 6); processing any transaction between you and a third party; and tracking sales. Using your information in this way is an essential part of us being able to provide the services to you;
  * 2.2service communications:we need to keep you informed about your use of the services for example, renewal reminders; and
  * 2.3 to monitor and improve our service: we may use your personal information for research, such as analysing market trends and gathering information on how you use our website and pages you have viewed.



You have a right to object to our use of your personal information for these legitimate interests (please see section 13 below).

 **3\. Contract** – It may be necessary for us to process your personal information to perform a contract to which you are party (e.g. providing you with a service), or to take steps at your request to you entering into a contract.

When you use any of our services, we may disclose your personal information to the following parties:

  *  **1\. Providers**   
This includes companies whose products or services are included on our website, with a view to them providing you with a quote. When these companies use your personal information in this way, they will be acting as data controllers of your information and therefore we advise you to read your chosen provider’s privacy policy. Some providers with whom we share your information may use it for analytical purposes.
  *  **2\. Data Processors**   
In order to provide the services, we may use third parties to process personal information on our behalf for tasks such as vehicle look up, house rebuild value, post code look up, host service provider and facilitating email communications with you. Also, for some products we may use quote facilities used by the provider to help facilitate the provision of a quote for you. The companies that provide these quote facilities act as data processors for us and/or the provider. 

We may also use certain data processors for analytical purposes, for example, to help us understand how well our website is performing and how you use our website.

Where third parties process your personal information on our behalf, we will ensure that they have the necessary high standards of security in place so that your data is kept secure and only used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

  *  **3\. Regulatory or governing bodies**   
We may need to pass information including personal data such asto regulatory bodies such as the Financial Conduct Authority for the purposes of compliance monitoring. This is a legal or regulatory obligation on us.
  *  **4\. Introducer websites**   
Where you have been introduced to our website from another independent website (introducer website), and where you have provided the necessary consent on our quote form, we may send that introducer website certain personal information relating to you for reasons which you have agreed to. We are not responsible or liable for the use or processing by the introducer of that data.



Where permitted by data protection and privacy law, we may also disclose information about you (including electronic identifiers such as IP addresses):

  * if required or permitted to do so by law;
  * if required to do so by any court, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Competition and Markets Authority or any other applicable regulatory, compliance, Governmental or law enforcement agency;
  * if necessary in connection with legal proceedings or potential legal proceedings; and/or
  * in connection with the sale or potential sale of all or part of our business.



If we reasonably believe false or inaccurate information has been provided and fraud is suspected, details may be passed to fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering.

### 7 How do providers use your personal data

If we transfer personal data about you to providers, it will be solely to enable them to provide a quote for you (or in the case of the energy comparison service, to switch energy providers). Providers will be acting as data controllers in respect to any use by them of personal data transferred by us to them. You should read your chosen provider’s privacy policy when given the opportunity to do so.

To ensure providers have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, to help prevent fraud and to provide you with their best premium and payment options, they may obtain information from third parties at quotation and renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested. The checks may be against both public data (such as information from the electoral roll) and private data (such as your credit history).

This information may include a quotation search from a credit referencing agency. This search will appear on your credit report and will be visible to other credit providers. It will be clear that this is a quotation rather than a credit application by you to pay by monthly installments. This may happen regardless of whether you get a quote via the internet or phone for any of these services.

Some providers may use the personal data you provide to obtain a quote for their own internal purposes such as fraud prevention or for internal analysis (such as monitoring customer demographics, market trends or pricing analysis). Some of the providers may also use personal data they hold about you (or which is held by other members of their group or in some instances the company whose brand is administered by them) from loyalty schemes and other account information. Some providers may pass this personal data to their insurance underwriters.

Providers may also exchange information about you through various databases, such as the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE), which holds a record of incidents reported to providers by policyholders and third party claimants, as a way to help prevent fraud. Providers may also exchange information with other databases such as the No Claims Discount Database, the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI), and the Hunter Database (a central insurance and claims checking system). Providers may also share information with insurance underwriters. As mentioned above, the exchange of your information in this way allows providers to verify the information that is provided during the quote process and also helps detect fraudulent claims.

If you provide us with your driving licence number (‘DLN’) via our quote form the providers may pass this information to the DVLA in order for a search to be carried out to confirm your (or any named driver’s) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Carrying out these searches help providers to validate your information, preventing fraud and reducing incidents of negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure. DLN searches may be carried out as part of your quote or at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy. These searches will not appear on your (or the named driver’s) driving licence record information.For details of the information about you that the DVLA may hold, please see <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency> or <http://www.mylicence.org.uk/>.

Some providers who offer products designed for students or graduates may also undertake additional checks against higher education sources to verify your student or graduate status.

If you decide to enter into a contract with a provider through this website, the information you have provided to us, together with any further information requested by, and supplied by you or us to the provider, will be held by the provider for the purposes set out in that provider’s privacy policy. Therefore, **you are strongly advised to read your chosen provider’s privacy policy** and satisfy yourself as to the purposes for which the provider will use your personal information before entering into the contract. We have no responsibility for the uses to which a provider puts your personal information.

### 8 Contact from Providers

In relation to our online insurance comparison service, if during the quote process you tell us that you are you happy to be contacted by providers, you agree that your personal data may be used by the top three competing providers who provided you with the cheapest quotes to contact you with a view to seeing if you are interested in purchasing the quoted product.

Please note that the companies contacting you are solely based on the cheapest price retrieved not exclusively based on the cover you selected.

Where our offline insurance comparison service is used, up to 5 providers will contact you directly to provide a quote by telephone and where you have provided consent, by email and/or SMS.

If you click through to a third party website from our website (or confirm a switch with an energy provider), we cannot guarantee you will not be contacted by those parties. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites. Whenever possible we will only partner with other websites which maintain the same standards as are present on our own website but we cannot guarantee this. If you click through to any providers to their own website, you will be subject to that provider’s website terms and conditions and privacy policy which we would recommend you read carefully. Our business energy comparison system is provided Love Energy Savings.com Limited, registered office at Unit 2 Springfield Court, Summerfield Road, Bolton, England, BL3 2NT. By using that service we will need to review and agree to their own Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.

If you no longer wish to be contacted by providers for marketing purposes, please follow the instructions in their marketing communications, or consult their privacy policies for further information about unsubscribing.

### 9 How long do we retain your personal information

Unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, we will only hold your personal information on our systems for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or until you request it is deleted. Even if we delete your personal information it may persist on backup or archival media for legal, tax or regulatory purposes.

Seopa Limited is regulated and authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for non-investment insurance mediation and credit broking. We are registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) for data protection. As part of our FCA authorisation we have to comply with certain requirements in respect of the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. All these obligations places certain recording keeping requirements and the need to co-operate and share information with these legal entities where requested to do so.

We also handle the above data for our own legitimate business interests including but not limited to, the keeping of records and accounts, staff training and monitoring, recording sales or quotation requests generated, communicating with providers and in marketing out other similar services to you or reminding you if a renewal comes up.

### 10\. Do we pass data to third parties

Except as set out in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any of your personal data to other parties without your permission unless we are legally required to do so by, for example, a court order, for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime, or by a regulator.

### 11\. Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)

From time to time there may be a requirement to process your personal data in other countries outside of the European Economic Area where data protection safeguards differ to those of the UK. Where this is necessary, we will ensure that your data is kept securely and only processed in accordance with the data protection legislation. Your use of our services will be considered to be an indication of your consent to this transfer.
