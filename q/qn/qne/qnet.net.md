If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

QNET keeps track of the websites and pages our customers visit within QNET in order to determine what QNET services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customised content and advertising within QNET to customers whose behaviour indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

**Use of Cookies**

The QNET website use cookies to help you personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programmes or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide convenient features to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalise QNET's pages, or register with the QNET site or services, a cookie helps QNET to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses and so on. When you return to the same QNET website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the QNET features that you customised.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the QNET services or websites you visit.

The use of third party cookies is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

We employ or our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.  
**  
Flash LSOs**

We use local shared objects, also known as flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control, or display content based upon what you view on the QNET site to personalise your visit. Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, use flash cookies to collect and store information.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of data and type of data used, and also because of how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for flash cookies click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118).  

**Mobile Analytics**

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.

**Security of Your Personal Information**

QNET uses best industry practices to ensure that it secures your personal information from unauthorised access, use or disclosure and secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment., protected from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

QNET follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we have received it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Social Media (Features) and Widgets**

Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook ‘Like’ button and Widgets, such as the ‘Share this’ button or interactive mini programmes that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

**Testimonials**

We post testimonials on our website which may contain personal information. We do obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. To request removal of your personal information from our testimonials, contact us at privacy@qnet.net. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
