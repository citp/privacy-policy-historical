# QNX Software Systems Privacy Statement

### General

QNX Software Systems International Corporation and members of the QNX Software Systems Group (as defined below, collectively "QSS" or "we") respect each individual's ("you" or "your") right to privacy. This statement outlines how we collect, use, transfer and safeguard your personal information. To protect your personal information QSS does not sell, rent or trade your personal information except as outlined in this Privacy Statement.

### The Context for the QSS Privacy Statement

To understand how we are going to use your personal information, you need to understand QSS. 

We are a global organization with subsidiaries, offices, agents, distributors, resellers and business partners throughout the world. Two entities are "Affiliated" if one entity, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the other entity (with "control" meaning ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting stock of the entity, or in the case of a non-corporate entity, an equivalent interest).  An entity is a member of the “QNX Software Systems Group” if it is Affiliated with QNX Software Systems International Corporation and contains “QNX” in its name. 

Our primary products and services relate to the QNX RTOS and associated development tools (and while we do not anticipate it, this may change). Our primary customers are businesses and, as a result, we do not collect a great deal of "personal information" (specifically, information about an identifiable individual) and almost no sensitive personal information. Of course, to the extent that we do collect personal information we want to respect your privacy. 

#### Sales & Marketing

QSS must sell goods and services to be viable. To sell goods and services we have to market them. Whether you are an existing or prospective customer we use your personal information to market and sell QSS products and services, and complimentary third party products and services to you, or more likely the organization to which you belong. 

#### R&D 

We continually develop and improve our products and supporting services. Information you provide us will be used to build and provide better products and services, including technical support. 

#### General Administration

There are thousands of things that QSS must do to run its business day to day and year to year; for example, ship you product, send and collect invoices, create reports, etc. Your personal information may be used in any of these contexts. We will also use your personal information to negotiate, administer and enforce our contracts and meet our legal and contractual obligations throughout the world.

#### Human Resources

Our HR department manages the most personal side of our business - the people. If you have dealings with HR as a prospective employee we will use this information throughout QSS and its related entities for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry.

#### Partners

A real-time operating system generally sits at the center of a very complicated computer system. We have technology suppliers, licensors, partners, alliances, sub-contactors and the like whose products and services we are selling or supporting. We may need to use and share your information to support these partners in the context of the above. 

Further, if you are a partner we may have to share your personal information with other partners or customers. 

#### Distribution Channel

In certain areas of the world we do not sell our products and services directly, but do so through a channel of distributors, resellers and the like. We receive personal information from, and supply personal information to, our distribution channel in support of all the functions noted above. 

### Collection of Personal Information

To summarize the above, we gather personal information from a variety of sources including: 

·         directly from you, through (a) registration processes (on-line, off-line and otherwise) and (b) all forms of interaction with QSS and its employees. If you provide us with personal information regarding another person, such as a work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so; 

·         indirectly from: (a) our distribution channel; (b) our partners; (c) credit agencies; and (d) governments. 

Any personal information QSS obtains from any of these sources at any time is subject to this Privacy Statement.
