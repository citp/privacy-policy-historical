## Information Collection and Use

Qgiv collects personally identifiable information when you register for a Qgiv account, and when you use certain Qgiv products and services. Qgiv may also receive personally identifiable information from its resellers and other business partners. When you register with Qgiv, we ask for your contact information (such as your name, street address and e-mail address), as well as certain information pertaining to your business, along with billing information such as a bank account. We may also collect information in fulfillment of a merchant account or echeck gateway account, including drivers license number, social security number, and/or federal tax id number. In the course of processing a payment transaction, we typically receive from the merchant or financial institution information related to the transaction. This normally includes information about the payment that a consumer has furnished the merchant or financial institution in placing the order. The personally identifiable information may include, for example, the amount of the transaction, the consumer’s name, credit card number and expiration date, checking account number, billing address, and shipping address. Unless utilized in recurring billing or pledging, no credit card or checking account numbers are permanently stored on Qgiv’s servers, and are deleted immediately upon removal from a recurring billing option. Qgiv uses the information collected to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to process payment transactions, to facilitate billing, and otherwise deliver the Qgiv services. We may also send merchants service announcements, newsletters, and periodic notices about specials, new products and services and products and services offered by Qgiv business partners. Personally identifiable consumer information is used to process payment transactions and for no other purpose. Qgiv does not offer services to children. Qgiv does not request or knowingly collect personally identifiable contact information from anyone under the age of 13.
