Qwaya processes personal data in accordance with applicable personal data protection legislation. Within the EU/EEA, the general data protection regulation (”GDPR”) will apply from 25 May 2018. 

We will process your personal data when it is necessary to: (i) fulfil our agreement with you or respond to your inquiries; and (ii) comply with a legal obligation. Your data may also be processed when it is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest for Qwaya, inter alia, to market and improving our services. If a processing of data requires your prior consent, we will collect such consent before carrying out the processing in question. 

Personal data that we request from you and indicated as mandatory is required to be provided in order for us to provide the service, e.g. for statutory, contractual, administrative or technical reasons.

We will only keep your information for as long as we need it: (i) to provide you with our services; (ii) to improve our services or to communicate with you; and (iii) for legal and audit purposes. We have routines in place to ensure that personal data are deleted thereafter. 

###  5\. How do we share your information? 

We may share your information with other companies within the Funnel Group. 

We may also engage third parties for the provision of services to Qwaya, such as provision of IT-systems, services and other activities. Your data may be shared with and processed by such service providers on behalf of Qwaya as required for the provision of the services to Qwaya. Within the use and provision of such services, your personal data may be transferred to countries outside the EU/EEA (third countries). In relation to such third country transfers, certain security measures will be taken in order to protect your data and ensure that the data keeps an adequate level of protection, e.g. by entering into a data transfer agreement including model clauses issued by the EU Commission and available on the EU Commission’s website. 

Personal data may be disclosed to a third party if we are required to do so according to applicable laws and regulations or in order to detect and prevent fraud or security or technical problems. 

Companies which are processing personal data on behalf of us are obliged to sign an agreement with us in order to ensure a high level of protection for your personal data. 

###  6\. Information security 

We strive to provide a high level of protection in all our personal data processing. We have therefore taken organisational and technical security measures in order to protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use, alteration and erasure. 

Your password protects your Qwaya account, so you should use a unique and strong password, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having signed in to your Qwaya account.
