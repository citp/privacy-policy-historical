**Does Qwest link to other Web sites?**   
Yes. Our Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those Web sites. For this reason, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of other Web sites before providing them personal information. 

**Does Qwest use online ad services?**

Before you allow your children to go online without your supervision, we encourage you to establish a set of rules that you can all agree on.
