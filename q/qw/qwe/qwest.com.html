									<a name="5"></a> <strong>What does Qwest do to help safeguard personal information collected online? </strong> 
									<br>
									Qwest has adopted policies and procedures designed to help safeguard personal information collected online from unauthorized access and misuse. Particularly sensitive information you submit (like credit card and bank account numbers) is transferred from your computer to our system through a type of encryption technology known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). 
								
								</p>
								<p>
									<a name="6"></a> <strong>What are cookies and how do I disable them? </strong> 
									<br>
									Cookies are files placed on your computer by most Web sites including ours. The files help the Web site "remember" you, allowing us to personalize your visit. Your browser stores the cookie information on your hard drive and each time you return to our site, the cookie helps us serve up the offers that are available to you. 
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>

										<br>
										<br>
									</li>
									<li>

								<p>
									Companies that advertise on our Web sites may also use their own cookies. These cookies collect their own information independent of Qwest. You can disable these cookies as described above. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<a name="7"></a> <strong>Does Qwest link to other Web sites?</strong> 
									<br>
									Yes. Our Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those Web sites. For this reason, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of other Web sites before providing them personal information. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<a name="8"></a> <strong>Does Qwest use online ad services? </strong> 
									<br>
								
									We advertise on non-Qwest Web sites. When we do this, we collect customer information about visits to our sites generated through those advertisements. This allows us to recognize the origins of visits to our sites and helps us target our Internet advertising. The information collected does not contain any information that identifies you. We share it only among our contracting agents to assess the results of advertising and promotions. It is for Qwest purposes and not shared for their marketing purposes. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<a name="9"></a> <strong>Does Qwest collect information about children online? </strong> 
									<br>
									The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) applies to Web sites that direct their services to children under 13 and collect personal information from them or who have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information from children under 13. Qwest does not intentionally collect personal information from children, nor do we market to or target content to children. Before you allow your children to go online without your supervision, we encourage you to establish a set of rules that you can all agree on. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<a name="10"></a> <strong>When does Qwest update its online privacy policy?</strong> 
									<br>
								
									From time to time, Qwest may update this policy and/or our policies to reflect changes in our business, evolving technology, and changes in the law. We will notify you of any material changes by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to making the change. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<a name="11"></a> <strong>How can I contact Qwest? </strong> 
									<br>
									For questions about our privacy policies, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Qwest.com"><strong>privacy@Qwest.com</strong></a>. 
								</p>
								<p>
									This is a policy of Qwest's practices, and is not a contract between Qwest and our customers for any purpose, including private or governmental litigation or regulatory action.
