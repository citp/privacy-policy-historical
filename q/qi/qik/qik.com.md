Messages you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will never list the people to whom you’re directly connected.

**Third party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites:** Qik may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisement within the Qik Sites and Service. These third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your web browser, advertisement and links that appear on the Qik Sites and Service. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisement and to personalize the advertising content you see. Qik does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Qik to show an advertisement to certain audience (for example, men between the ages of 24-35) or audience segment (for example, men between the ages of 24-35 who have streamed video live) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use this information regarding your use of Qik Sites and Service, such as number of times you viewed an ad (but not personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.

If you click on an advertisement, or click a link that takes you to a website that is not operated by Qik, you should familiarize yourself with the privacy practices of that advertiser or website. Qik's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites.
