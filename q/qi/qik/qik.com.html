<h1>
Privacy Policy
</h1>
<p>
Qik, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Qik"), recognizes that its customers, visitors, users and others (collectively or individually "Users") who use <a href="http://qik.com">qik.com</a> or other websites owned or operated by Qik ("Sites") and the related services including without limitation the mobile client, "Embeddable Flash Player", Qik-in-Touch Desktop Client Application, the WAP service, the SMS service or other features or applications (collectively, the "Service") respects and value their privacy.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on the Qik Sites and Service. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Qik Terms of Service. Your use of the Sites and Service and any personal information you provide on Qik Sites and Service remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. Please note that any graphic, video, image, picture, photo, location or other content posted at the direction of Users onto the Qik Sites and or the Service becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
As a general rule, no personally identifiable information is automatically collected from users of Qik Sites or Service. Personally identifiable data about Users of our Sites and Services are known to us only when voluntarily submitted by Users of the Site or Services. Qik works hard to earn and keep your trust, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:
</p>
<h2>
Information Collection
</h2>
<p>
<strong>User Provided Information:</strong> In order to use Qik Sites and Service, you may be required to provide certain identifiable information (such as your cell phone number and name) when choosing to participate in various activities on the Qik Sites and Service such as streaming live video, uploading videos, viewing your own recorded content, managing your networks, posting messages, tagging content, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to our newsletters or other mailing lists. Once a user, you may provide additional information as a part of your profile describing yourself and your preferences. Providing additional information beyond what is required is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new opportunities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information about your Contacts:</strong> In order to share your live video streams, recorded content or any other content, you may invite other Users by providing their names, email addresses or cell phone numbers. This information will be used only to send your invitation and reminders. You may also choose to import your contacts from other networks. All this information will be viewable by you unless you specify otherwise. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this Privacy Policy as cover your own personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy policy as cover your own personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Location information:</strong> We derive location information from your mobile carrier or from the mobile device that you use with the Service. You control when your location is shared with others. Your location is displayed and shared with others on the Service only in accordance with your privacy settings on the Service. In addition, certain premium features of the Service provide more detailed location information than the basic Service. You also may create location information by "geo-tagging" your Content with location information.
</p>
<p>
Most users will use location information for social purposes, such as noting the location of a family event captured on video. However, please keep in mind that location information can be very sensitive and subject to misuse or over-monitoring by others, such as family and current or former neighbors, friends and acquaintances. It is important to take care in managing your privacy settings for location information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mobile Device information:</strong> Due to communication standards on mobile devices, any time you use your mobile browser to visit the Qik Site or Service, we record certain information that your web browser or device sends. This information contains information about your device (such as device manufacturer's name, device model number, operating system of the device, carrier network, etc.). All information collected about your device is used solely for customer support purposes and to provide you with the best possible service. This information is not sold to device manufacturer, network operators or any third party for any commercial gain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies &amp; Log Files:</strong> Like most web sites, Qik uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Qik to recognize you as a user when you return to the Sites using the same computer/device and web browser. Qik uses both session and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your web browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your web browser on subsequent visits to the site. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your web browser. You can set your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Qik Site or Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookie is disabled.
</p>
<p>
Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Qik Sites, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser and or device sends whenever you access any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, platform type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the service, but is not linked to personally identifiable information in any way.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Children:</strong> Children under the age of thirteen (13) should not provide any personally identifiable information on the Service or Sites without the knowledge and permission of his or her parent or guardian. In the event that Qik determines that a user of the Service or Sites is under the age of 13, Qik will not maintain or use any personally identifiable information about such user without the consent of his or her parent or guardian, except as allowed by law. The result of the foregoing is that children under the age of 13 will be unable to participate in some activities on the site without parental consent. Qik may collect personally identifiable information directly from visitors on this site who may be under the age of 13. However, Qik does not collect this information without the knowledge of the visitor.
</p>
<h2>
Information Use
</h2>
<p>
Qik Sites and Service utilize your personally identifiable information and location information to operate, maintain and provide you with the features and functionality of the Qik Sites and Service. Any personal information, location information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (such as forums, discussion boards, posting comments, chats, your profile page, etc.) become publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your Name (not email address) is displayed to the other Users when you stream videos, upload videos, or send messages through Qik Sites and Service as a result of which other users can contact you through messages or comments. Based on your privacy settings, any content that you submit to Qik may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels and may be viewed by the general public.
</p>
<p>
We do not use your cell phone number, email address or other personally identifiable information or location information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your cell phone number, email address and/or location information without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Qik Site and/or Service changes or for customer service purposes).
</p>
<p>
We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP address, browser type, clickstream data, aggregated data, etc.) to improve the overall quality and design of Qik Sites and Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing and analyzing preferences and trends.
</p>
<p>
We use Cookies and Log File information to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your current or future visits to the Qik Sites and Service
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Provide custom, personalized content and information
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Monitor aggregate metrics (such as total number of visitors, page views, etc.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Track your entries and status in contests, sweepstakes and promotions
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Information Sharing
</h2>
<p>
<strong>Sharing Information With Third Parties:</strong> Qik takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties for commercial or marketing purposes. We will only share your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. We may however provide personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other businesses or persons for processing such information on our behalf. In these cases, we require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
We do share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, aggregated data, etc.) with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Qik Sites and Service.
</p>
<p>
We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information if required to do so by law, or if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
</p>
<p>
Qik also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information that Qik believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third party claims or allegations, to assist government or enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our website and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Qik, our Users or others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Communications Between Users:</strong> Many messages you initiate through Qik Site or Service (such as an invitation sent to a non-user), will list your name, email address or cell phone. Messages you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will never list the people to whom you’re directly connected.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites:</strong> Qik may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Qik Sites and Service. These third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your web browser, advertisement and links that appear on the Qik Sites and Service. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisement and to personalize the advertising content you see. Qik does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Qik to show an advertisement to certain audience (for example, men between the ages of 24-35) or audience segment (for example, men between the ages of 24-35 who have streamed video live) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use this information regarding your use of Qik Sites and Service, such as number of times you viewed an ad (but not personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
</p>
<p>
If you click on an advertisement, or click a link that takes you to a website that is not operated by Qik, you should familiarize yourself with the privacy practices of that advertiser or website. Qik's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites.
</p>
<h2>
Accessing and Changing your Account Information
</h2>
<p>
You can review and update your personal information at any time by visiting your profile page. You may of course decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Qik Site and Service, in which case Qik may not be able to provide certain services to you. Please note that media files by Users of Qik Sites and Service remain subject to our Terms of Service, even if you have deleted them from the pages associated with your account. If you inadvertently post materials in violation of our Terms of Service, please send an email to <a href="mailto:report@qik.com">report@qik.com</a>
</p>
<h2>
Our Commitment to Security
</h2>
<p>
We pay close attention to security. First, we focus significant time and resources to ensure that user accounts and information are not misused by Qik employees. A limited set of employees are authorized to access user accounts, they are educated about the importance of maintaining user privacy, and their access to user accounts is recorded. Our employees are also contractually required to access accounts and log data only for quality, security, audit, and other internal business purposes. Second, we use commercially reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We implement technology and procedures to try to make sure that external parties cannot access or modify users’ personal information on our servers. These technologies and procedures include industry standard methods, like communicating over secure socket layer (SSL), as well as our own proprietary methods. Additionally, private information can be accessed only by providing your password.
</p>
<p>
We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Qik over the public networks. Once we receive your information, Qik makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.
</p>
<p>
If Qik learns of a security system breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Qik may post a notice on the Qik Sites and Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
</p>
