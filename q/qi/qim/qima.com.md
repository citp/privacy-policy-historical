This Personal Information Collection Statement and Privacy Policy (hereinafter collectively the " **Privacy Policy** ") provides an overview of our privacy practices and tells you about the information that we collect when you access or use our services, either via an QIMA website (hereinafter referred to as the "Site") or in any other way agreed with us (hereinafter, collectively, our " **Services** "), as well as how we may use or disclose such collected information. The list of websites convered by this Privacy Policy can be found below.1

We act as "Data Controller" of your personal data.

If you do not agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Services.

## 2\. Principles of the Processing

We are committed to fully complying with data processing requirements worldwide. This includes but is not limited to both the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) and the European Regulation no. 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) in case our processing activities are related to offering our Services to data subjects that are either physically located in or citizens of those countries. We encourage you to check your details and email communication preferences here: [E-mail Preferences](https://web.archive.org/emailPreferences).

Therefore, we have configured our Services so that the use of personal data is kept to the minimum necessary. We have also adopted safeguards and technical and organizational measures in order to protect the rights of data subjects, and to ensure that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the data are being processed.

Some of the aforementioned data may be indispensable so as to fulfill the obligations imposed by the law or other regulations, or to provide the Services you may have requested. Refusal to disclose certain Personal Data, identified on the applicable form with an asterisk (*), may make it impossible to provide you with the Services and/or complete all purchase contract phases and/or fulfill all obligations required by the laws and regulations in force.
