We take this trust very   seriously, and that's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal   information. This policy allows us to document our commitment to you that we   will not sell or share your personally identifiable information, including your   name or email address   without your permission or as required by law.</p>
				  <p>The QxMD Privacy Policy set out below describes our policies and   practices regarding the information we collect from you, how we use that   information, and our commitment to you to safeguard that information.</p>
				  <p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
		    </div>
				<div>
                  <h3><a id="what_info" name="what_info"></a>1. What information does QxMD   collect?</h3>
				  <p><strong>We may request that you supply us voluntarily with personal   information.</strong></p>
				  <p>Generally this information is requested when you register to download our mobile   software. For example:</p>
				  <ul>
                    <li>When you register with QxMD, we ask for demographic and contact   information including your name, email address,  profession,   and specialty so that we can provide you with more customized   service and information. </li>
				    <li><a href="#top">top</a></li>
			      </ul>
				  <h3><a id="how_use" name="how_use"></a>2. How does QxMD use the information we   collect?</h3>
				  <p><strong>We use the information we collect to improve our products and   services and provide you with the best possible user   experience.</strong></p>
				  <p>In order to make sure we are targeting the most relevant content   to our subscribers, we need to understand who our subscribers are and collect   information that will assist us in tailoring subscribers' experiences.</p>
				  <p>We also use this information to contact you regarding relevant QxMD   services and products. For instance, we may contact you by email to let you know that we have   released a new product or service or a new version of an existing product.</p>
				  <p>Please note that WE DO NOT SELL <a href="#pers_iden">PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE   INFORMATION</a> about your use of our products to any third parties.</p>
				  <p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
				  <h3><a id="track_use" name="track_use"></a>3. Does QxMD track your use of its   products?</h3>
				  <p><strong>We do not track your usage of our downloaded software products. We do collect aggregate data on usage of our online clinical calculators in order to improve our subscriber experience and to prioritize new product   development</strong></p>
				  <p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
				  <h3><a id="how_protect" name="how_protect"></a>4. How does QxMD protect your   information?</h3>
				  <p><strong>QxMD safeguards the security of the data you send us with   physical, electronic, and managerial procedures.</strong></p>
				  <p>These procedures include limiting access to the information in various ways   depending on the nature of the information as well as training our employees on   the proper handling of subscriber information. While we believe we have taken   appropriate measures to protect the information that we have received, we urge   you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the   Internet. </p>
				  <p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
				  <h3><a id="will_share" name="will_share"></a>5. Will QxMD share the information   it collects with others?</h3>
				  <p><strong>Please be assured that QxMD:</strong></p>
				  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Does not share or sell our subscribers' names, email addresses or   contact information;</strong> </li>
				    <li><strong>Does not disclose the identity of our subscribers; and</strong> </li>
				    <li><strong>Does not disclose information on how subscribers are using QxMD   products except in aggregate or non-personally identifiable form.</strong> </li>
			      </ul>
				  <p>QxMD may provide <em>aggregate or non-personally identifiable</em> statistics about our customers, product usage or traffic patterns, and   related website information, but these statistics will not include any   personally identifying information.</p>
				  <p>Tracking data is also used internally by QxMD primarily for developing   and enhancing products and improving technical usability. For more information,   refer to <a href="#how_use">"How does QxMD use the information we   collect?"</a></p>
				  <p>Note: QxMD may   disclose personal information as allowed or required by applicable law,   including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (a) protect the   rights, safety or property of subscribers of our website and products, the   public, or QxMD, and (b) conform to legal or regulatory requirements. No   other disclosures of personally identifiable information will be made without   your prior consent.</p>
				  <p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
				  <h3><a id="cookies_links" name="cookies_links"></a>6. How does QxMD use   "cookies" and log files?</h3>
				  <p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on   your computer's hard drive. <strong>We use both session cookies and persistent   cookies on our website to help us provide you with a more personalized   experience.</strong> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can   usually change your browser settings to prevent that if you would rather not   store the information for future use. Disabling cookies in your browser,   however, may prevent access to some parts of our website.</p>
				  <p><strong>As is true of most websites, we gather and use certain information   automatically and store it in log files.</strong> This information includes   Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP),   referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp. We use this information   to analyze trends, to administer the website, to track users’ movements around   the website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a   whole. <strong>We do not link the information we store in cookies to any   personally identifiable information you submit while on our   website.</strong></p>
				  <p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
				  <h3><a id="links_others" name="links_others"></a>7. How does QxMD link with   other websites?</h3>
				  <p><strong>The QxMD website contains links to and from other websites.   QxMD does not share your personal information with those websites and is   not responsible for their privacy practices.</strong> We encourage you to learn   about the privacy policies of those companies.</p>
				  <p>Please note that our site uses sponsored Google advertisments. We advise you to review  Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> to understand how they use your data and data from our site to generate targetted advertising for you. </p>
				  <p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
				  <h3><a id="subject_change" name="subject_change"></a>8. Is this privacy statement   subject to change?</h3>
				  <p><strong>Yes. The QxMD Privacy Policy is subject to change at any   time.</strong></p>
				  <p>By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this   information by QxMD as disclosed in this statement. If we decide to   materially change our privacy practices, we will post a prominent notice of   those changes on the homepage and/or send an email so that you are always kept   informed of what data we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we   disclose it. <strong>Please check this page for changes from time to time to   make sure you are aware of our latest privacy practices.</strong></p>
				  <p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
				  <h3><a id="terms" name="terms"></a>13. Important Terms</h3>
				  <p>In this policy, when we use the term "we" or "our", we mean both QxMD   and third parties with whom QxMD contracts to assist in its business   operations. These contractors may, however, only access your information in   furtherance of their services to QxMD and may not use or disclose your   information except as permitted by QxMD.</p>
				  <h3><a id="pers_iden" name="pers_iden"></a>What is "personally identifiable"   information?</h3>
				  <p>When reviewing any privacy policy on the Internet, you should be familiar   with the terms "personally identifiable" and "non-personally identifiable"   information. "Personally identifiable information" is any information that can   be used to identify, contact or locate you as an individual, as well as any   additional data tied to such information. Common examples are your name and   email address.   Non-personally identifiable information is information — either in "profile" or   "aggregate" form — that, in contrast, is not intended to identify you as an   individual.</p>
