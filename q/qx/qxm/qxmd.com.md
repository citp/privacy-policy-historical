### What is “personally identifiable” information?

When reviewing any privacy policy on the Internet, you should be familiar with the terms “personally identifiable” and “non-personally identifiable” information. “Personally identifiable information” is any information that can be used to identify, contact or locate you as an individual, as well as any additional data tied to such information. Common examples are your name and email address. Non-personally identifiable information is information — either in “profile” or “aggregate” form — that, in contrast, is not intended to identify you as an individual.
