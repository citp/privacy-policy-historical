The GDPR applies both to the online and the offline processing of personal data. On the contrary, the ePrivacy Directive is a separate law that addresses the uses of personal data specifically in the online environment. Although we are required to be compliant with the GDPR’s general legal framework, we also rely on consent under the ePrivacy Directive to the extent we are required to do so, and when we refer to "ePrivacy Consent" below, it is on this basis but without prejudice to the performance of some of our data processing activities on the basis of our legitimate interest, where possible.

_Customer segmentation_

To give you the best possible customer experience, we need to get a good picture of who you are.  To help us to do that, we run a customer segmentation programme, using a third party service provider who allocates customers to certain categories or segments based on, for example, their age, address, gender and order data (i.e., what they have purchased).  Our service provider then enriches that information with so-called lifestyle data.  These are just statistics-based assumptions, for example on your probable life situation (eg single household), your shopping habits, your media usage (eg "online", "TV", "magazines", "social networks") and your location.  Based on the overall information, we assign you to a specific customer segment, and we then delete the lifestyle data.  The segment you are in becomes part of your customer record.  This allows us to offer you promotions, products and services that are most likely to interest you. Customer segmentation and data processing are done under a legitimate interest basis meant to enrich your experience so that you only receive advertising that is tailored to your individual needs, while serving QVC’s interest in engaging its customers.      


_Who can see my personal information?_

We grant individuals who help QVC provide the Services access to your personal information, as necessary to perform the tasks required.  These people may work for third party service providers.  These third party service providers are required to agree to safeguard your personal information appropriately and according to law. QVC may also share your personal information with certain "Affiliates" in their capacity as the direct and indirect owners of QVC. These owners include Qurate Retail, Inc. and its direct and indirect owners. QVC may also share your personal information with certain other Affiliates as necessary to perform the tasks required, and these Affiliates include QVC, Inc., HSN, Inc., zulily llc, and the other companies that are directly or indirectly owned by Qurate Retail, Inc.

We also share personal information about you with others for additional purposes, including:

  * As required or permitted by applicable law, for compliance with a legal obligation; establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary;
  * At the request of government authorities conducting an investigation;  

  * With our third party service providers for order fulfillment, shipping, processing payments, customer serivce, Easy Pay review, account servicing, customer research, marketing, provision of information technology services, and records maintenance;
  * If we believe there has been a violation of our terms or policies, or to protect anyone’s rights, property, life, health, security, or safety;
  * In connection with any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure, or repossession), lease, amalgamation, or any other type of acquisition of all or any portion of QVC’s assets, financing, disposal, conveyance, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company;  

  * With third parties that conduct analytics or data appending to help us offer you more relevant products and services; or  

  * For other purposes disclosed elsewhere in this Privacy Statement, or at the time you provide your personal information.  




Aggregated or de-identified information that cannot be used to identify an individual and anonymised information is not considered personal information that is covered under this Privacy Statement.

_Data Transfers outside of the EEA_

QVC's Affiliates and third party service providers who have access to personal data may be located in other countries, and these countries may not have an adequacy decision by the European Commission. Any transfer of data to an Affiliate or third party service provider is covered by model clauses or another transfer mechanism to ensure that personal data is treated with care. You may contact the DPO or legal counsel at the information provided if you would like more information about these clauses or transfer mechanisms.

Where restricted, sensitive personal data types will not be transferred outside of the country. Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, health, sexual orientation, sex life, trade union membership and genetic and biometric data are subject to special protection and considered by EU privacy law to be “sensitive personal data”.

_Links to Other Websites_

Our Services contain links to websites or applications controlled by third parties, for your convenience and information. Some linked websites or applications are operated by entities not affiliated with QVC, and these linked websites or applications have their own privacy policies or notices. If you visit other websites or applications through links found on QVC's Services, please review the posted privacy policies on those websites or applications. QVC is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any website or application that is not controlled by QVC.

_How long does QVC keep your personal information?_

Personal information is retained based on legal, business, and contract requirements. If you have additional questions regarding retention, please contact [DPOUK@qvc.com](mailto:DPOUK@qvc.com).  Personal information will be deleted, anonymised, or be limited to specific purposes and kept  for no longer than is necessary, taking into account the limitation periods for potential claims.  If a type of personal information is used for more than one purpose, then the personal data would be restricted, but kept for the longest applicable period.

Retention of your account, including name (first, last), address (street address, city, post code), email and customer number, will be kept pending an annual review for the limited purposes of fraud prevention and warrantees. Retention of this information will be reviewed on an annual basis to confirm that the additional purposes still apply.  Criteria will include risk of storage and exposure, as balanced with legal requirements for criminal and civil fraud limitation periods, financial and security risk, warranty periods, and customer status.

Requests for deletion will be limited by their continued necessity under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, as required or permitted by applicable law, for compliance with a legal obligation; establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary; at the request of government authorities conducting an investigation; if we believe there has been a violation of our terms or policies, or to protect anyone’s rights, property, life, health, security, or safety; to resolve outstanding disputes; or to troubleshoot existing problems, such as submitted security or functionality issues. 

Logs within systems will be kept with consideration of the type of data in the system, as well as legal and regulatory guidance requires.
