# Privacy statement

**At QVC your privacy is a priority.**  
QVC does not sell or exchange customer information with anyone else. We share relevant information only with those parties entrusted with the processing of your account and the fulfilment of your order and to parties entrusted by us to undertake customer surveys. We have established procedures to protect your privacy – and we uphold them vigorously.

**Customer information is gathered so we can serve you better.**  
We make every effort to ensure its security and to treat your information responsibly. When you become a QVC Member, we ask for your name, address and phone number. We also ask for your credit card number and its expiry date, if you select that method for payment. Once we have your credit card information, we will not ask for it again unless a change is required. Your order history information is maintained in order to service your account.

Credit card transactions are subject to routine searches from time to time. QVC undertakes these searches in association with licensed credit agencies to detect and prevent fraud.

When you order from QVC, you can pay by cheque if you wish. Cheque payments to QVC are processed using Transax, a payment clearance system that operates without the need for a cheque guarantee card. Your order is released and delivered to you when payment has cleared.

From time to time, we may write or telephone in order to update your account, or to give you information that we hope might interest you. If you don't want us to get in touch, simply tell a Customer Service Representative, or contact us at [**webmaster**](https://web.archive.org/ukqic/qvcapp.aspx/app.html/params.file.%7CCus_Webmaster,html), to have your name removed from our contact list.

**What information is collected?**  
When you visit QVCUK.com, our system automatically notes which browser and Internet Provider (IP) you used for access. This information is useful because it helps us to create a site that offers you the best possible shopping experience. 

**What if I don't want to send personal information over the Internet?**  
Simply use QVCUK.com like a catalogue to look up the products you want, then phone free on **0800 50 40 30** to order them. Any information you give to QVC, by telephone or the Internet, is stored on a secure server.

**What if I want to order over the Internet, but don't want to use ‘cookies’?**  
Most browsers are set to accept cookies. A cookie is a data package that your computer receives from the main server. It helps to identify the user and store information specific to the user and allows the server to customise content for users. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but this means you won't be able to order form QVC UK.

**What steps are taken to keep my personal information private?**  
Your order information is sent to us through a ‘secure session’ established with Secure Socket Layer (SSL). This technology encrypts (scrambles) your account information before it is sent to us, making it virtually impossible for anyone other than QVCUK.com to read it. We protect all customer data against unauthorised access. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access to safeguard your personal information. 

**How can I change, correct, or update the information on my account?**  
When ordering on QVCUK.com, you can select **Custom Check-Out** to give us a different Ship-To Address or change your method of payment.

You can also call Customer Service free on **0800 51 41 31** to change your address, telephone number or credit card account information.
