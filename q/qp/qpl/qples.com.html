<p><b>Qples, Inc. (Qples) and your Privacy</b></p>
<p>This privacy statement (“Privacy Policy”) covers the site www.Qples.com and its related websites, services, software applications and products (“Sites”), as well as our clients, advertisers and affiliates (collectively, “Affiliates”). Qples is committed to our users' privacy.  This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand what personal and non-personal information we collect, how it is protected and used, and how you can control it.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact privacy (at) Qples.com.  Changes to this Privacy Policy will be made on this web page as further described below, with an updated “Updated” date above, reflecting the date of the most recent changes.</p>
<p>At Qples we respect your right to privacy and we expect that, as a visitor to our website, you prefer to control your own personal information preferences. For this reason, we may ask you to register or provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of our website. Here are some examples of when Qples may ask for / collect personal information – when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>View, print, or otherwise interact with coupons</li>
<li>Redeem coupons</li>
<li>Register with Qples or its Affiliates</li>
<li>Use Qples services in conjunction with Facebook Connect or similar external registration methods</li>

</ul>
<p>Note: Using Qples software or applications, including mobile applications, may require the collection of information about the device in order to detect and prevent coupon or other fraud.  This fraud detection and prevention may include the installation of a device identifier that may remain in-place, even if Qples software or application(s) are removed.  This identifier is used to prevent fraud, and does not include personal information.</p>
<p>Our Sites may contain links to third-party websites, products and services.  This Privacy Policy only applies to our Sites and our collection and use of your information. The linked third party websites, products and services, and their collection and use of your information, are governed by the privacy policies of such third parties. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies and practices of those third parties in connection with your use of those sites.</p>
<p>We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the content and services we provide on our website are always tailored to your current, designated preferences. Your privacy is extremely important to us, and your information is intended to be used for purposes that relate to savings, coupons, loyalty and content customization provided by Qples and its Affiliates. Qples may share that data with brands with whose coupons you are engaging or the affiliates of those brands.</p>
<p>Qples respects the rights users give us when opting to receive e-mail or other forms of communication and enforces internal policies to preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term ability to continue to communicate with our customers and visitors to our Sites.</p>
<p>If you do not want Qples or Qples’ representatives to contact you, you may "opt-out" of this preference at any time, whether you are online or by contacting Qples directly. As an option, you will have the flexibility to opt back in at any time based on previous information or newly updated information.</p>

<p>Collecting Personal Information:</p>
<p>When you browse our websites, you are able to do so without providing personally identifiable information such as an e-mail address. Generally, we don't collect personal information when you browse. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us at least the type of computer and operating system you are using.
Like most standard Web site servers our website uses log files and cookies. A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your web browser for record-keeping purposes and helps Qples provide better service to you. Your browser has an option to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent and stored.
Once a user enters our websites, a cookie follows them through their click stream path collecting information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use only. IP addresses, etc. are not currently linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>When you use a Qples site or application, certain technologies may be used to collect non-personal information. Technologies used may include but are not limited to web beacons and cookies, IP addresses, unique device IDs, user IDs, and log files. These activities can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coupon requests</li>
<li>Coupon prints</li>
<li>Web browser type and/or operating system and/or platform</li>
<li>Referral website</li>
<li>Pages viewed</li>
<li>Ads viewed and interacted with</li>
<li>Access dates and times</li>
<li>Geo location</li></ul>
<p>Location Information:</p>
<p>Use of the Sites, including mobile applications, may include location-based services. If you use those services, Qples may receive information about your location which Qples may use to send you geographically relevant promotions or advertisements.</p>
<p>Analytic Tools:</p>
<p>Qples may use tools such as Google Analytics to better understand who is using our Sites and how they are using them. These tools use cookies to collect information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the website, IP address, and type of operating system used. Qples may use the data collected from visitor cookies in aggregate form only and does not tie to them any personally identifiable information. Use of this information helps Qples better understand what users are seeking and learning on Qples websites and helps Qples identify potential navigation issues.</p>
<p>Data Retention:Qples retain all information collected about you for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how we use the information we collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>To operate our service, including the offering, delivery and redemption of coupons and other services and products</li>
<li>To operate our offers and advertisements and promotions and similar activities</li>
<li>To measure and adjust the effectiveness of offers and campaigns</li>
<li>To improve our service by understanding trends and preferences and other measures and metrics</li>
<li>To Improve the look and feel of our Sites</li>
<li>To assist you (users) in the operation of the Sites and services</li>
<li>To create new products, functions and features</li>
<li>To facilitate customer service and improvements in customer service</li>
<li>To help make the offers and advertisements and products we present to you to be more timely and relevant</li></ul>
<p>Protection of Your Personal Information:M</p>
<p>Qples will always do its best to protect the personal information that you share with us. Qples stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment.
We do not share personally identifiable information with our Affiliates or other third-parties for their marketing or promotional uses except as part of a specific program or feature in which you have actively chosen to participate (such as a coupon or offer).</p>
<p>The Sites incorporate physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. Additional security measures, such as Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) or other technology, will be used if you engage in financial transactions on our Sites. However, as no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us.</p>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website, or as required by law.</p>
<p>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:</p>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain information from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our Sites is structured to attract anyone under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Sites at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Sites without verified parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<p>Qples’ privacy policy may change from time to time. Qples will not reduce your privacy rights under this policy without your explicit consent. As provided herein, we will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes will result in a use of your information in a manner inconsistent with the policy under which your information was collected, we will attempt to notify you via e-mail, if you have chosen to provide us with your e-mail address, with an opportunity to opt out of any such use. We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>
