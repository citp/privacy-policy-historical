<p>At Qlik, we are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information while using our website, products or services. In this policy, Qlik sets out how we collect and use personally identifiable information and personal data, including information that you provide to us.</p>
<p>You can travel through most of our site without giving us any information about yourself. Sometimes, we do need information to provide services that you request and this statement of privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read the complete Qlik privacy statement. By using our website, you consent to the collection, sharing and use of information as described here.</p>
<h2>Collecting your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Personal information is information that identifies you individually, such as your name, address, email address, company name, phone number, or other identifying information that is specific to you.</p>
<p>Generally, personal information is collected when you are a customer or potential customer of Qlik or when you are asked to register for such items as events, newsletters, reports, software or documentation downloads, or discussion groups. Personal information collected by Qlik often is limited to your name, e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested or to support your use of our products.</p>
<p>As a convenience to our site visitors, we may provide links to other web sites that are not governed by this privacy policy. These linked sites are not under the control of Qlik, and we are not responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites.</p>
<h2>Use of your Personal Information</h2>
<p>We use your personal information for the following primary purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once. </li>
    <li>To help you quickly find software, services or information. </li>
    <li>To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you. </li>
    <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from Qlik. </li>
    <li>To help us optimize our customer relationship management. </li>
    <li>To improve your user experience with our websites, products and services. </li>
    <li>To help us troubleshoot any problems you might experience with our products and services. </li>
</ul>
<p>Qlik will not use personal information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.</p>
<p>We may periodically send you promotional emails or news about our company and our products which we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided. To opt-out of distributions at any time, please enter your email address at: <a href="http://www.qlik.com/opt-out" target="_blank">http://www.qlik.com/opt-out</a>.</p>
<h2>Sharing your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Any information you provide while visiting the Qlik site or otherwise may be used by Qlik (including any company of the Qlik group) or an authorized Qlik partner or vendor with whom we share it. Qlik will only share personal information to the extent needed to perform the uses listed above, and will take such steps as are necessary to safeguard personal information. For example, our vendors and partners are required to keep such personal information confidential and not to use it other than for the purposes intended. Qlik does not sell or rent personal information to third parties unless you have given us permission to do so.</p>
<p>Where necessary, personal information may be transferred from one country to another (such as outside the EEA) and adequate procedures will be taken by Qlik to protect personal information. In addition Qlik adheres to the EU-US Safe Harbor principles, as described in more detail in our <a href="/us/info/privacy/safe-harbor-privacy-policy">Safe Harbor Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Qlik will employ reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.

<p>Qlik takes reasonable steps to help ensure that the personal information is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current. Reasonable steps shall also be taken to accommodate privacy preferences, such as restricting access to the personal information to those who have a legitimate business need to know the information, anonymizing certain information, or assigning codes or pseudonyms when the actual names are not required for the purpose at hand.</p>
<p>Employees who have access to such personal information shall be trained regarding this Policy, advised that they are responsible for fully complying with the privacy principles articulated in this Policy and instructed that violations of these principles shall result in appropriate discipline up to and including termination.</p>
<p>While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Web site and records no website or Internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur.</p>
