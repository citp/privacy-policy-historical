<b>QRZ.COM's Privacy Policy</b><br>
</font>

<p>
QRZ, is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users.
Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible
management of consumer information.  We welcome all users to our site
and want to insure that you are comfortable.  We pledge that as we gather
and use information about you, we do so responsibly.


</p><p><b>Consumer Information </b>

</p><p>
QRZ.COM publishes information on the World Wide Web and on CDROM
that is obtained from open, public domain sources and in some cases
directly and voluntarily from users themselves.  The information may
include but is not limited to, your name, your address, your email
address and possibly other data that you may voluntarily provide.
</p><p>
This information is generally used by members of the amateur
radio community for the purposes of contacting each other through both
internet and traditional means.   Our site is also used as a means
by which to share common interest information as it applies to the
worldwide community of amateur radio operators.
</p><p>
Amateur radio address and contact information is and has been published
in the public domain for a great many years.  Before the advent of
the Internet and the World Wide Web, the same types of information that
we now provide was routinely published in printed directories (Callbooks).
These directories are of a paramount interest to those involved in
this particular hobby, especially as it applies to the exchange of
written communications that result from contacts made on the air.


</p><p>
<b>Data Collection and Opt Out</b>

</p><p>
Participation in the QRZ data collection process is voluntary except
for the occasional use of browser "cookies".

</p><p>QRZ, as well as most sites on the Internet, occasionaly may use "cookies" to
enhance your experience on the web. QRZ does not and cannot use these cookies to
personally identify you in any way. 

</p><p><b>What are cookies and why do we use them?</b>
</p><blockquote>
Our cookies consist of a unique random number that our system
generates and hands back to your browser.  As you move from
page to page within the QRZ site, we are able to verify your login
identity without asking you to re-submit your password each time.
This is done so that only you may update your callsign information,
your biography or your photo, and, so that only you may post new
messages in your name.  We're not stalking you, we're only keeping
track of your identity to prevent others from doing so.
<p>
The cookie that QRZ assigns does not contain any information
whatsoever.

</p></blockquote>
Cookies are only required by QRZ if you intend to update information
relating to callsigns, or, if you intend to post articles or want
ads on our site.  To participate as a reader and/or observer only,
cookies are not required.

<p>
<b>Opt Out Procedure</b>

</p><p>If you would like to "opt out," that is, to prevent any non-FCC
data from being displayed by QRZ about you, please notify us by
email.  Please address all correspondence to:
<a href="mailto:editor@qrz.com">editor@qrz.com</a> and simply 
state your amateur radio CALLSIGN and which non-FCC information you
would like <b>not</b> to have presented by QRZ.

</p><p>
Please be aware that information that is published by the FCC
in the public domain will continue to be displayed by QRZ even
after you opt out.  'Opting Out' affects only that data
that the FCC does <b>not</b> provide.  Non-FCC data includes your
birth date, your biography, your picture, your email address,
and your home page address.  


</p><p>If you have any additional questions about QRZ's dedication to
consumer privacy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:editor@qrz.com">editor@qrz.com</a>.  </p> </font>
