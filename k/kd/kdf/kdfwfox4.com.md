# MyFOXDFW.com Privacy Policy

_Effective as of January 1, 2009_

MyFoxDFW.com operates the Internet web site located at www.MyFoxDFW.com (the "MyFoxDFW.com Web site" or the "Site"). MyFoxDFW.com is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles available at <http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html> applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. MyFoxDFW.com has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") such as your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number or credit card number we obtain from users of our Site. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by MyFoxDFW.com, including the Site, FoxHiLites, watchmy27.com, the MyFoxDFW.com mobile services and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by MyFoxDFW.com in connection with the Site (collectively, the "Services"). 

The MyFoxDFW.com Web site is a general audience site and MyFoxDFW.com does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age. 

From time to time MyFoxDFW.com may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of the Services, or technology. Your continued use of the Services after MyFoxDFW.com posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If MyFoxDFW.com materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change. 

**COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PII BY MYFOXDFW.COM**

General. When MyFoxDFW.com collects PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the PII to us in order to register for the MyFoxDFW.com Web site. MyFoxDFW.com may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in MyFoxDFW.com's activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, and surveys or because you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to MyFoxDFW.com for review. Registration PII required includes email address along with screen name and password. Other information including birth date, gender, country and zip code are optional. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties. 

In addition, MyFoxDFW.com collects other non-PII including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This data is used to manage and improve the Services, track usage, and for security and monitoring purposes. 

Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that MyFoxDFW.com places on your computer. MyFoxDFW.com uses the cookies to identify your Internet browser, store users' preferences, and to determine whether you have installed the enabling software needed to access certain material on the Services. 

Third-party advertisements displayed on the Services may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. MyFoxDFW.com does not control these cookies and users of the Services should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the "Notice" section below for more information on third party advertising. 

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies or block all cookies. However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on the Services 

**NOTICE: MYFOXDFW.COM WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES**

When you voluntarily provide PII to MyFoxDFW.com, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses MyFoxDFW.com will make of the information. 

At the time you provide your PII, MyFoxDFW.com will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII (See "Choice" below). Except as described in this Privacy Policy, MyFoxDFW.com will not share your PII with third parties unless you have given MyFoxDFW.com permission to do so (See "Use" below). 

Sometimes we collect PII from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Privacy Policy and other relevant information from us. 

The Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third- party sites may be co-branded with the MyFoxDFW.com logo or an affiliated entity, even though they are not operated or maintained by MyFoxDFW.com (for example, co-sponsored chat pages, or advertising sponsor pages). The MyFoxDFW.com

Web site may also carry advertisements from other companies. MyFoxDFW.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Services or for the privacy practices of third parties or Internet advertising companies. Once you've left the Services via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third parties or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you. 

The Services may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with MyFoxDFW.com (i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Although all News America Group entities adhere to the group's Privacy Principles located at <http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html> , visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. 

Some of the advertisements that appear on MyFoxDFW.com are delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to or use of our Services, including information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit:

These outside contractors, agents, or sponsors may only use your PII to provide MyFoxDFW.com with a specific service and not for any other purpose without your consent. MyFoxDFW.com may also provide your PII to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires the sharing of your PII. 

As described in the "Notice" section above, MyFoxDFW.com may customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on our Site, or may work with outside companies to do so.
