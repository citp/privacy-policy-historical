##  SA Rugby Magazine Website Privacy Policy

  
**1\. Audience**

This policy applies to all visitors to our website and customers who have subscribed to the services we offer (“you” and “your”).

**2\. Purpose of this policy**

We respect your privacy and take the protection of personal information very seriously. The purpose of this policy is to describe the way we collect, store, use, and protect information that can be associated with a specific natural or juristic person and can be used to identify that person (“personal information”). Personal information:

2.1 includes

  * certain information collected on entering competitions through Facebook comments (see below); and
  * optional information that you voluntarily provide to us (see below).



2.2 excludes

  * information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific person;
  * permanently de-identified information that does not relate or cannot be traced back to you specifically; and
  * non-personal statistical information collected and compiled by us and information that you have provided voluntarily in an open, public environment or forum including (without limitation) any blog, chat room, community, classifieds or discussion board. Because the information has been disclosed in a public forum, it is no longer confidential and does not constitute personal information subject to protection under this policy.



**3\. Acceptance of terms**

You must accept all the terms of this policy when you register for any of our services. If you do not agree with anything in this policy, then you may not register for and use any of the services. By accepting this policy, you are deemed to have read, understood, accepted, and agreed to be bound by all its terms.

**4\. Changes**  
We may change the terms of this policy at any time. We will notify you of any changes by placing a notice in a prominent place on the website or by email. If you do not agree with the change you must stop using the services. If you continue to use the services following notification of a change to the terms, the changed terms will apply to you and you will be deemed to have accepted such terms.

**5\. Collection**

5.1 On entering competitions. Once you enter a competition through the use of the Facebook commenting mechanism, you will no longer be anonymous to us as you will provide us with personal information. This personal information will include:

  * your IP address.



5.2 Optional details. You may also provide additional information on a voluntary basis such as your name, telephone number and postal address (“optional information”).

We use information gathered by cookies to improve the website. Please note that some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers) use their own cookies or widgets on our website. We have no access to or control over them. Information collected by any such cookie or widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it, and not by us.

5.4 Purpose for collection. We may use any service information and optional information provided by you for such purposes as indicated to you at the time you agree to provide such service information or optional information.
