## Information Collection and Use

### Information Collection

Kepware Technologies is the sole owner of the information collected on kepware.com sites. Kepware collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

### Registration

In order to use certain areas of this Web site, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide additional demographic information (such as industry and application needs), and some unique identifiers, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.

### Order

We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

### Information Use

All information collected on our site will be used for improving users' experiences when visiting our site. Marketing will utilize the information for internal market planning. Kepware Technologies will not share personal information with anyone outside Kepware Technologies nor disclose user information to any third party, except to our Exclusive Business Partners.

### Profile

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users' personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties.

### Cookies

Kepware uses temporary cookies to provide you with customized information while you are visiting our web site. We do not store cookie files or any other data on your computer. We use temporary cookies (also known as session variables) to process and validate your registration when you sign in. This allows us to provide you with personalized content, such as "My Account." Other uses for our temporary cookies include keeping track of preferences you specify while you are using Kepware's services, for example, your local zip code; displaying the most appropriate advertising banners and content based on your interests and activity on our web site; estimate and report our total audience size and traffic; conduct research to improve Kepware's content and services; and require you to re-enter your Kepware password after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.

### Third Party Advertising

Kepware's website currently does not promote any third-party advertising.

### Log Files

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service. We use a tracking utility called OneStat that uses log files to analyze user movement.

## Communications from the Site

### Special Offers and Updates

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. 

### Newsletter

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

### Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. Users may opt-out of these communications. Please see our Choice and Opt-out section.

### Customer Service

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users' wishes.

### Sharing Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

### Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

We do not share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

### Service Providers

We partner with other third parties, such as Verisign (credit card processing) and Industrial eCommerce (order processing) to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

### Business Transitions

In the event Kepware goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances be a part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email along with a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

### Choice/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at Sales@Kepware.com or the user may contact us at 1-888-Kepware (1-888-537-9273) or mail us at PO Box 579, Portland, ME 04112 to opt-out.

### Links

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Kepware Technologies, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

### Surveys [& Contests]

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used [shared with the contest [survey] sponsors, if applicable] to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

### Tell-A-Friend

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Kepware Technologies will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Kepware stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact Kepware at Sales@Kepware.com to request the removal of this information from our database.

### Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to Sales@Kepware.com

### Supplementation of Information

In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

### Purchasing History

In order for this Web site to enhance its ability to tailor the site to a user's preference, we collect information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information to create a personalized user profile.

### Enhancement of Marketing Profile

We purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our users would be interested in. We use this information to enhance or overlay the 'profile' of individual users. This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to the users' personally identifiable information. See also the "Profile."

### Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the registration page or by emailing our sales team at Sales@Kepware.com. Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
