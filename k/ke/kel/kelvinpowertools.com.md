### 12\. Integration of the Trusted Shops Trustbadge

Following an order, the Trusted Shops Trustbadge is incorporated into this web page in order to display our eventually collected reviews. In balancing the various interests, this serves to safeguard our legitimate interests in an optimised marketing of our goods and services. The trustbadge and the services advertised are provided by Trusted Shops GmbH, Subbelrather Str. 15C, 50823 Köln. Whenever a trustbadge is called up, the web server automatically stores a so-called server log file which contains, for example, your IP address, the date and time of retrieval, the data volume transferred and the requesting provider (access data), and documents the retrieval. This access data will not be evaluated and will be automatically overwritten seven days after your visit to the page. Other personal information will only be transferred to Trusted Shops if you decide, after completing an order, to use Trusted Shops products or have already registered for their use. In this case, the contractual agreement between you and Trusted Shops applies.
