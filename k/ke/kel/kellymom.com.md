# KellyMom.com Privacy Notice : KellyMom

July 2, 2011. Posted in: [About](http://kellymom.com/category/about/ "View all posts in About")

At KellyMom.com, your privacy is important to us.

In order to comment on or subscribe to blog posts, a user may be required to give certain information such as name and email address. This information may be used to contact you about your registration. At your option, you may also provide demographic information (such as gender or age) about yourself.

To join one of our closed Facebook support groups, a user may be required to give certain information such as Facebook name, email address, and/or reason for joining. This information is used only to help ensure that spammers and trolls do not gain access to these support groups.  We encourage you to think carefully before posting personal information in any public forum like Facebook, as you are unlikely to know everyone personally. These groups are set up as Closed Groups. [According to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=220336891328465&ref_query=group),  anyone on Facebook can see the group name, its members and people invited to join the group, but only members can see posts in the group. To join our closed groups, you need to follow the directions given in the group description. Your friends can see that you’ve been invited or added to a closed group in their news feed. Facebook changes its policies frequently and has its own [privacy policy](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/), so it’s always a good idea to review this periodically.

To buy from us, you must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address). This information is used to fill your order (possibly by a 3rd party) or contact you regarding your order. You will also need to enter payment information in a 3rd party website such as [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/). They will have their own privacy policies.

KellyMom.com does not sell, rent or otherwise provide any information to anyone.

We use Google Analytics to better understand how visitors use KellyMom.com. The Google Analytics privacy policy can be found here, along with information on opting out: [http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html).

KellyMom.com contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these sites.
