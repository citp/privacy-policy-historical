<h1>Website Privacy Notice</h1><br>Our Privacy Notice is an important part of our commitment to provide you
 with the best financial and client service possible. We believe it is 
essential to clarify how KEMBA uses collected information, the benefits 
of such use and the way information is protected against unauthorized

customer lists or individual customer information to any third parties.<br>
<br>
Each member relationship at KEMBA is built on trust. We have implemented

with applicable laws and this notice. In addition, only employees 
actively engaged in the discharge of assigned duties involving customer 
information are authorized to access that information.<br>

placed on your computer hard drive that allows the KEMBA server to log 
the pages you use in the KEMBA website to determine if you have visited 
the site before. It also stores your preferences and other information
