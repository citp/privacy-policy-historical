      <h4>Legal Basis for Data Processing</h4>
      <p>We process personal data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, as described
        above. Our legal basis to process personal data includes processing that is: necessary for the performance of the
        contract between you and us (for example, to provide you with the services you request and to identify and authenticate
        you so you may use the Site); necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable
        accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); necessary for our legitimate interests (for
        example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the Site); and based on consent by our customers (for
        example, to communicate with you about our products and services and provide you with marketing information), which
        may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by using preference settings in emails or on our Sites, <a href="http://privacypolicy.umusic.com/email/default.asp">using this form</a>, or emailing us as set out in the Contact section) without affecting the lawfulness of processing
        based on consent before its withdrawal. </p>
      <p>We may use automated decision making technologies, including profiling, to support our data processing activities. Our
        automated decision making capabilities include logic that attempts to identify artists, music, communications, products,
        or offers that we believe may interest you. By using this logic, it helps us personalize your interactions with UMG
        and UMG artists. For you, this means that you may see online advertisements, direct marketing communications (if
        you have subscribed), or other advertising or marketing messages or special offers based on your activity on our
        Sites or interactions with UMG Companies or our third party partners. </p>
      <p>In some instances, you may be required to provide us with personal data for processing as described above, in order for
        us to be able to provide you to use all the features of the Site. </p>
      <h4>International transfers</h4>
      <p>Our sharing your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, may involve transferring your data outside the
        European Economic Area (EEA). Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree
        of protection is afforded to it by ensuring, where required by law, at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>transferring personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal
          data by the European Commission; </li>
        <li>using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has
          in Europe; or </li>
        <li>transferring personal data to the United States to an entity if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires
          them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to request a copy of relevant safeguards by contacting UMG
        as described in the “Contact” section.</p>

      <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
      <p>We, or our third party partners, may employ a software technology called web beacons (also known as web bugs, clear gifs
        or pixels) which helps us understand what content is effective, for example by counting the number of users who have
        visited these pages, and to understand usage patterns. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar
        in function to cookies, and are used to let us know when content is viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored
        on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded on web pages, ads, and e-mail. We, or our third party
        partners, may tie the information gathered by web beacons to the other information we collect about you. </p>
      <p>In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted
        advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers
        by visiting websites operated by the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>, or <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu/">European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance</a>. </p>
