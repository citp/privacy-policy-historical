# Privacy Policy | KETK

### Effective Date: Friday, June 11, 2010

The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of KETK NBC ("we" or "us"). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the KETK website (the "Site"), the information that you may provide to us, and the ways in which we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our children's privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case we'll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.

### INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT

The information that we collect about you while you are using the Site falls into two general categories, as described below. The information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a third-party website hosting provider, or another third-party service provider, on our behalf.

**Information That Is Automatically Collected**

We collect and store information that is generated automatically, including through web site analytics programs, as you navigate through our Site. For example, to help make the Site more responsive to the needs of users, we may collect information about your computer's connection to the Internet and employ on our Site, or on certain pages of our Site, a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie" to assign each user a unique, random number that resides on a user's computer. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference information before. Of course, you are free to set your Web browser not to accept cookies or delete the cookies that have been placed; however, doing so may render your computer unable to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of the Site. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.

**Information Voluntarily Supplied by Website Users**

We may collect and store personal or other information (such as your name, email address, year of birth, or zip code) that you voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). Some examples of this type of information include information that you electronically submit when you contact us with questions, information that you post on blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social networking areas on our Site, information that you electronically submit when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain features of our Site, and information contained in search requests or questions that you submit to the Site. If you decline to supply or provide us with certain information while using the Site, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Site.

### HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to process your registration request, and customize features and advertising that appear on the Site. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described below, we reserve the right to use, and to disclose to our affiliates and third-party service providers, all of the information collected from and about you while you are using the Site in any way and for any purpose.

We will not use the information that we collect while you are using the Site, nor will we authorize third parties to use such information, to mail or e-mail promotional offers directly to you unless you have specifically informed us that you would like to receive such promotional offers.

If you do not wish your information to be used for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given or sold to third-parties.

Our Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to content, products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase products or services from a third party site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.

Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our [Term of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service), or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public.

Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or one or more of our websites is acquired by another company, information about our users may be among the transferred assets.

### INFORMATION COLLECTED BY AD SERVERS, THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS

We may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, and/or a third-party ad serving software, to collect non-personally identifiable information about Site users and Site activity, and we may use this information to, among other things, serve targeted advertisements on this Site. The information collected allows us to analyze how users use the Site and to track user interests, trends and patterns, thus allowing us to deliver more relevant advertisements to users.

Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party's privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If you have any concerns about a third party's use of cookies or web beacons or use of your information, you hould visit that party's website and review its privacy policy.

The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase third-party products or services through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.

We also may make content, products and services available through our Site through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear on the Site in connection with such content, products and/or services. We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner's use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for more information. 

### INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN PUBLIC AREAS OF OUR SITE

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online - for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.
