			       		<div class="content"><h3>Effective Date: Friday, June 11, 2010</h3>

<p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection 
practices of KETK NBC ("we" or "us"). Specifically, it outlines 
the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the 
KETK | East Texas News, Weather and Sports | Tyler, Longview, Jacksonville website (the "Site"), the information that you may provide 
to us, and the ways in which we use this information. This Privacy Policy, 
including our children's privacy statement, does not apply to any 
information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or 
through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or 
through the mail).</p>

<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the 
Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, 
is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. Because the 
Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at 
some point in the future, in which case we'll post the changes to this 
Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy 
to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we 
post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.</p>

<h3>INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</h3>

<p>The information that we collect about you while you are using the Site 
falls into two general categories, as described below. The information we 
collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a 
third-party website hosting provider, or another third-party service 
provider, on our behalf.</p>

<p><strong>Information That Is Automatically Collected</strong></p>

<p>We collect and store information that is generated automatically, 
including through web site analytics programs, as you navigate through 
our Site.  For example, to help make the Site more responsive to the 
needs of users, we may collect information about your computer's connection 
to the Internet and employ on our Site, or on certain pages of our Site, 
a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie" to assign each 
user a unique, random number that resides on a user's computer.  Cookies 
are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for 
record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, 
cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users 
visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from 
having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where 
you may have entered preference information before. Of course, you are 
free to set your Web browser not to accept cookies or delete the cookies 
that have been placed; however, doing so may render your computer unable 
to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of 
the Site. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files 
also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users 
who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.</p>

<p><strong>Information Voluntarily Supplied by Website Users</strong></p>
<p>We may collect and store personal or other information (such as your 
name, email address, year of birth, or zip code) that you voluntarily 
supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in 
responding via email to a feature provided on the Site).  Some examples 
of this type of information include information that you electronically 
submit when you contact us with questions, information that you post on 
blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social networking 
areas on our Site, information that you electronically submit when you 
complete an online registration form to access and use certain features 
of our Site, and information contained in search requests or questions 
that you submit to the Site. If you decline to supply or provide us with 
certain information while using the Site, you may not be able to use or 
participate in some or all of the features offered through the Site.</p>

<h3>HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
<p>We use the information we collect from you while you are using the 
Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to process 
your registration request, and customize features and advertising that 
appear on the Site. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process 
described below, we reserve the right to use, and to disclose to our 
affiliates and third-party service providers, all of the information 
collected from and about you while you are using the Site in any way 
and for any purpose.</p>

<p>We will not use the information that we collect while you are using 
the Site, nor will we authorize third parties to use such information, 
to mail or e-mail promotional offers directly to you unless you have 
specifically informed us that you would like to receive such promotional 
offers.</p>

<p>If you do not wish your information to be used for these purposes, 
you must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address 
is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off 
any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or that 
may be given or sold to third-parties.</p>

<p>Our Site also includes links to other websites and provides access 
to content, products and services offered by third parties, whose 
privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website 
or purchase products or services from a third party site, use of any 
information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the 
operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products 
or services.</p>

<p>Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our 
visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce 
our <a href="/terms-of-service">Term of Service</a>, or to protect 
the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public.</p>

<p>Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell 
various assets. In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of 
our assets, or one or more of our websites is acquired by another 
company, information about our users may be among the transferred 
assets.</p>

<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED BY AD SERVERS, THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS 
AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS</h3>
<p>We may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, and/or 
a third-party ad serving software, to collect non-personally 
identifiable information about Site users and Site activity, and we 
may use this information to, among other things, serve targeted 
advertisements on this Site. The information collected allows us to 
analyze how users use the Site and to track user interests, trends 
and patterns, thus allowing us to deliver more relevant advertisements 
to users.</p>

<p>Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and 
present advertising on the Site also may collect information from you 
via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party 
advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to 
help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the 
advertisements' effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and 
collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and 
ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party's privacy policy 
and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy 
policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be 
different from ours. If you have any concerns about a third party's 
use of cookies or web beacons or use of your information, you 
hould visit that party's website and review its privacy policy.</p>

<p>The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access 
to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy 
policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase 
third-party products or services through the Site, use of any 
information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator 
of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.</p>

<p>We also may make content, products and services available through 
our Site through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, 
where the brands of our provider partner appear on the Site in 
connection with such content, products and/or services. We may share 
with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is 
collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available 
in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider 
partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the 
privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider 
partner's use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider 
partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding 
the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact 
the provider partner directly for more information.

</p><h3>INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN PUBLIC AREAS OF OUR SITE</h3>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your 
personal information available for viewing by third parties online - 
for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat 
areas - that information can be seen, collected and used by others 
besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party 
use of such information.</p>

<h3>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY STATEMENT</h3>
<p>This children's privacy statement explains our practices with respect 
to the online collection and use of personal information from children 
under the age of thirteen, and provides important information regarding 
their rights under federal law with respect to such information.</p>

<ul>
	<li>This Site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen 
	and we do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information 
	from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site. We screen 
	users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent 
	users under the age of thirteen from providing such information. If we 
	become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable 
	information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, 
	we will delete such information from our records. If we change our 
	practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent 
	before collecting any personally identifiable information from children 
	under the age of thirteen as part of the Site.</li>
	<li>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from 
	children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we also do NOT 
	knowingly distribute such information to third parties.</li>
	<li>We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly 
	post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information 
	through the Site.</li>
	<li>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from 
	children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we do NOT condition 
	the participation of a child under thirteen in the Site's online activities 
	on providing personally identifiable information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>MAKING CHANGES TO YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
