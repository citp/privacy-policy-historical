At Kerio Technologies Inc. (“Kerio”), we know that you care about how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. Please read the following to understand what Information we collect, how we use that Information, to whom we may disclose that Information, and how we safeguard that Information. Because the Internet is global, the Information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and stored in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. By using our various Websites and our Products and Services, you explicitly consent to such use of your Information and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Finally, be advised that this Privacy Policy includes Kerio’s European Union and Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy statements.

## What Information We Collect

As a visitor of our Website, you can engage in many activities without providing any Personal Information. However, we do automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our webpages (e.g., IP address, browser type, software and operating system used, device type, carrier). Kerio also uses cookies, which are small text files that a web site can send to your browser to be stored automatically on your computer. You may set your browser to reject or disable cookies, however be advised that you may be prevented access to certain parts of our Website if you do so. Kerio may also use clear GIFs, which are one pixel graphic image files on our Website that may collect the time the GIF was viewed or the type of browser that requested the image file.

If you register as a customer, download free evaluation software, upgrades, order e-mail newsletters or engage in other activities, Kerio may ask you to register by filling out an online form, where you will be asked to provide information that personally identifies you and/or your company name (e.g., address, email address, phone number, title/position, demographics, etc.). When you purchase one of our Products or Services direct from Kerio, you may also be asked for your credit card or other financial/payment information. We also “collect” on your behalf what you upload or input while using the Services, such as information, data or files, although we do not use anything uploaded. We also collect information from surveys, contests and sweepstakes.

In addition to personal information, we collect aggregated data, which we define as anonymized (non-personalized) information about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. For example, we may collect information regarding type of company, size and number of users, usage characteristics, and other information regarding usage profiles. Such information may be used for internal business purposes or provided to partners or other associated third parties without restriction. However, no personal information is included in aggregated data. We simply collect aggregated data to help us understand our users’ needs and to improve our Products and Services by considering new features and functionality or otherwise tailoring our Products and Services. We may share aggregated data about our users with third parties for similar purposes. We may also use such information even if and after you stop using our Products or Services.

## How We Use the Information We Collect

In general, we use your personal information to process your requests and transactions, to provide you with the Products and Services you request, to alert you to upgrades and updates, and to share with you special offers and updated information we think will be of interest to you. We also use aggregated data to make the Website easier to use, to improve site performance and content, and to monitor web traffic and usage. Credit card numbers are only used for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.
