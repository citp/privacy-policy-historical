<p class="body">Your privacy is very important to us at Keen 
  ®, and Keen is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy 
  Program. What is TRUSTe? TRUSTe is a non-profit organization dedicated 
  to building trust in the Internet. We disclose information practices to 
  TRUSTe, who in turn operates as third-party "watch dog" by auditing 
  our privacy practices to make sure that we are in compliance with TRUSTe's 
  privacy standards. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, 
  you can expect to be notified of: What personally identifiable information 
  of yours is collected; What organization is collecting the information; 
  How the information is used; With whom the information may be shared; 
  What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution 
  of the information; What kind of security procedures are in place to protect 
  the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control; 
  and How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.<span class="body"> 
  </span></p>
<p class="body">If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, 
  you should first contact Keen, Inc. by sending email 
  to <a href="mailto:privacy@keen.com">privacy@keen.com</a>. If you do not 
  receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily 
  addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html">http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html</a>. 
  TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Keen to resolve 
  your concerns. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect 
  about you and what may happen to that information. Although this policy 
  may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you 
  should know as much as possible about Keen's practices 
  so that you can make an informed decision.<br>

  Children</span><br>
  <span class="body">Children are not eligible to use Keen 
  and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal 
  information to us.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span class="subhead"><a name="security"></a>2. Security</span><br>
  Keen has security measures in place to protect the loss, 
  misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We use Secure 
  Socket Layer (SSL), which digitally encrypts your information, as it is 
  transferred from your computer to Keen. We have taken 
  measures to protect user information once it is received by the site, 
  including but not limited to the following: limited and controlled access 
  by employees, servers and data stored in a secured location, security 
  software where appropriate and cost effective. Employees are informed 
  of all security protocol on a regular basis, and web security procedures 
  are quality-assured weekly. </p>
<p><span class="subhead"><a name="informationwecollect"></a>3. Information 
  Keen Collects<br>
  </span> <span class="body">Our primary goal in collecting personal information 
  from you is to provide you with a smooth and efficient experience while 
  using Keen. This allows us to provide services and features 
  that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make 
  your experience easier and quicker. We don't require you to register in 
  order to browse Keen, but you do need to register in 
  order to connect with other members of Keen via telephone 
  or Keen Mail.</span> </p>
<p class="body">When you join Keen using our online registration 
  form, we collect an email address, member name, and password. Your member 
  name is used throughout Keen to identify you to other 
  Keen Members. Therefore, you should be aware that if 
  you use your real name as your Member name, this information would be 
  visible to others on the site. You can also join Keen 
  via 800Predict.com using the co-branded online registration form. Keen 
  members who join Keen through the 800Predict.com co-branded 
  online registration form and through Keen's online registration 
  form are subject to the Keen privacy policy.</p>
<p><span class="body">Because we connect members by telephone, we require 
  you to enter a valid telephone number to connect with other members through 
  Keen. At no time will we share your telephone number 
  with anyone, including those members with whom you communicate through 
  Keen. Because Keen initiates all telephone 
  calls, no one can see your telephone number - not even with Caller ID. 
  Although the Keen system maintains the connection between 
  the two parties, we do not monitor or record the content of telephone 
  calls made through Keen. </span></p>
<p><span class="body">We use your email address to contact you regarding 
  administrative notices, new product offerings, and communications relevant 
  to your use of Keen. If you do not wish to receive these 
  communications, you have the ability to stop receiving these communications 
  by sending your member name and email address to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@keen.com">unsubscribe@keen.com</a> 
  or by unchecking the box on the Personal Info page which asks if you wish 
  to receive such mailings. You can also stop receiving the newsletter by 
  replying to the newsletter email with "unsubscribe" as the subject line. 
  You may also unsubscribe by calling Keen Help at 1-877-533-6435.</span></p>
<p class="body">You will receive administrative emails that are related 
  to the primary usage and functionality of <span class="body">Keen</span>. 
  You may not opt-out of administrative emails.</p>
<p class="body">If you are earning money on Keen, we collect 
  additional information from you so we can process and remit to you your 
  KeenSpeaker fees. We collect your mailing address to remit payments, and 
  we collect your social security number and/or Federal Tax ID number to 
  prepare Form 1099s if necessary. We will never share this information 
  with third parties. Members who are not United States taxpayers will not 
  be asked for their social security numbers or Federal Tax ID numbers, 
  though they <span class="body">may need to report income to their local 
  tax authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="body">Keen collects credit card information 
  when you add money to your Keen account. Keen 
  uses a third party to process credit cards for billing purposes. This 
  third party does not store or retain any of a member's personally identifiable 
  information. In certain cases, we will also use credit card information 
  to verify age in order to provide access to certain areas of the site. 
  We do not charge or bill the credit card when we collect credit card information 
  for age verification purposes. </span> </p>
<p class="body">You can review, update and change your personally identifiable 
  information -- including your name, e-mail address, telephone number, 
  password and PIN number -- by clicking on the Personal Info link on the 
  My Keen page. You can review, update or change your address and credit 
  card information -- if you have supplied it -- by going to the My Keen 
  page on the Site, clicking on the link to the My Account page, and then 
  clicking on the Credit Card Information link. You may correct, update 
  or delete any of your Keen listings by <span class="body">clicking 
  on the My Listings link on the My Keen page. You may also update or correct 
  information by calling Keen Help at 1-877-533-6435, or you may write to 
  Keen at Keen Customer Support, PO Box 
  418, San Francisco CA 94104-0418.</span></p>
<p><span class="body">If you choose to include your personal information 
  in the Keen search feature, your name and email address 
  will help others find listings you have created. For example, if a person 
  knows that a friend is a member of Keen, but doesn't 
  know the friend's member name, that person can search for any listings 
  that the friend has created by typing in the friend's first name, last 
  name, or email address in the search field. We will never disclose member 
  names or email addresses during the search process unless you choose to 
  make this information available, and you can remove yourself from the 
  search feature by clicking on the Personal Info link from the My Keen 
  page.</span></p>
<p><span class="body">You may also provide Keen additional 
  profile information (such as experience, credentials, affiliations, on-call 
  schedule, etc.) that is displayed publicly on the Site in your homepage 
  or in your listings. Other than the profile information submitted by our 
  members, and except as noted herein, Keen does not disclose 
  any personally identifying information without your permission.</span></p>
<p><span class="body">Keen's Tell a Friend Program allows 
  members to earn money by referring their friends to our Site. The contact 
  information you enter as part of Keen's Tell a Friend 
  program will be used only to personalize a one-time referral e-mail sent 
  to your friends.</span></p>
<p class="body">We use information we maintain about you, and other information 
  we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve 
  disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Member Agreement. At times, 
  we may look at your account information and transaction history to identify 
  problems or resolve disputes. Moreover, such information is never completely 
  removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact we 
  back up our systems. Therefore, our members' personally identifiable information 
  may not be completely removed from our databases in response to member 
  requests.</p>
<p class="body">Keen also facilitates communication among 
  members through our on-site Keen Mail system. Messages sent via Keen Mail 
  are identified only by your member name, and we do not reveal either member's 
  personal e-mail address.</p>
<p class="body">Keen may use certain information collected 
  from our members in aggregate form to tailor our members' experience at 
  the Site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, 
  and displaying the content according to your preferences. We may also 
  use this information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts.</p>
<p class="body">Keen uses cookies. Cookies are small amounts 
  of data sent to a user's browser from the Keen Web servers 
  and stored on a user's computer's hard drive. Keen uses 
  cookies to track the pages on the Site that our users have visited. This 
  allows us to collect aggregate information about usage on the Site. Keen 
  may also use cookies to deliver content specific to members' interests, 
  and to keep track of members' member names and passwords so that members 
  do not have to reenter them during a session. If you choose not to accept 
  cookies, you will be unable to use the Keen web site.</p>
<p class="body">Keen uses clear gifs, or pixel tags, provided 
  by our adserving company to help manage our online advertising. These 
  clear gifs allow our adserving company to recognize a browser's cookie 
  when a browser visits this site. This allows us to learn which banner 
  ads bring users to our Web site. The information we collect and share 
  through this technology is not personally identifiable (It does not include 
  your name, address, telephone number or email address). In addition, we 
  use a third party advertising company to serve ads on other web sites. 
  These ads contain cookies. Our third party advertising company may use 
  information (not including your name, address email address or telephone 
  number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to measure 
  advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements about goods and 
  services of interest to you. This policy only covers the use of cookies 
  by Keen and does not cover the use of cookies by any 
  advertisers. Keen does not have control, nor access to 
  the information contained in its advertisers' cookies. To find out more 
  about how Doubleclick manages the privacy of information in conjunction 
  with serving ads on this, or for your choices about not having this anonymous 
  information used, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/">click 
  here</a>.</p>
<p class="body">Keen uses your IP addresses to help diagnose 
  problems with our server and to administer the Site. Generally, IP addresses 
  tell us the location from which a person is connecting to us, what service 
  provider the person is using, and which parts of the Site the User is 
  visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. 
  This means that your session will be tracked, but you will remain anonymous. 
  We reserve the right to track IP addresses for the purposes of fraud prevention, 
  and we reserve the right to release IP addresses to legal authorities.</p>
<p class="body">If you send Keen e-mail correspondence, 
  or if other members or other third parties send us e-mail or other correspondence 
  regarding a particular member's activities or postings on the Site, Keen 
  may collect such information.</p>
<p class="body"><span class="subhead"><a name="disclosure"></a>4. Our Disclosure 
  of Your Information.</span><br>
  We do not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifiable information 
  to third parties, and we do not use members' mailing address information 
  for unsolicited marketing. The only exceptions are when we either have 
  your permission or we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 
  For example, in some cases, the government can compel the disclosure of 
  information about you, and Keen will need to comply if 
  it believes such disclosure to be appropriate, in which case you authorize 
  it to do so. You also consent to Keen disclosing information 
  about you to actual or potential parties to a lawsuit that Keen 
  is or may become involved in (a) if it required to do so, (b) if it reasonably 
  believes that such disclosures will potentially mitigate its liability, 
  or (c) to enforce its rights. Keen may disclose some 
  personally identifiable information to third party service providers in 
  connection with communications and payments to users and other aspects 
  of operation of the site. Keen uses a third-party newsletter 
  company to deliver Keen newsletters, and we share your 
  email address with this newsletter company. Third parties will be under 
  extensive confidentiality restrictions.</p>
<p class="body">We may from time to time run promotions in which we ask 
  visitors for demographic information (like their zip code, state/province 
  or age). We may also run contests on Keen in which we 
  ask visitors for demographic information. We use this data to tailor your 
  experience, showing content that we think you might be interested in, 
  and displaying the content according to your preferences. We also use 
  demographic information to determine eligibility for certain contests.</p>
<p class="body">From time to time Keen may ask members 
  to participate in surveys. Such surveys may ask visitors for contact information 
  (like their email address). We use contact data from our surveys to send 
  information about our company. </p>
<p class="body">In order to enhance your listings, you may <a href="https://www.keen.com/secure/credentials/credentials_agreement.asp">verify</a>
  your professional and academic credentials through AbsoluteBackgrounds.com, 
  a leading provider of comprehensive background checks on individuals. 
  You may submit information to be verified by <a href="http://www.absolutebackgrounds.com">AbsoluteBackgrounds.com</a> 
  (such as academic degrees and professional licenses) on the Keen 
  web site. All information submitted as part of the verification program 
  is subject to the <a href="https://www.keen.com/secure/credentials/credentials_agreement.asp">agreement</a>
  between the member and AbsoluteBackgrounds.com, which may contain terms 
  that differ from Keen's privacy policy.</p>
<p class="body">Keen may contain links to other sites. 
  Keen is not responsible for the privacy practices or 
  the content of such Web sites. We encourage you to review the policies
