# Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy
Stella & Dot wants your experience with us to be nothing short of fabulous. We respect the
privacy of our Stella & Dot Family Brands Independent Business Owners, customers and those
who use our services. To this end, we have systems in place for securely managing your
Personal Information. We created this Privacy Policy to help you understand the types of
information we collect, how we use and disclose it, your options related to it, and our
responsibilities in safeguarding it.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Use. All capitalized terms not defined in
this Privacy Policy have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use.
This Privacy Policy applies to the Service, and it also applies to collection of your Personal
Information from offline sources as described in this Privacy Policy.
“Personal Information” means information that alone or when in combination with other
information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email
address, or phone number. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that
has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
      We collect Personal Information when you:
             register to use the Service, place an order, or provide contact information to an
              Independent Business Owner;
             register as an Independent Business Owner or express interest in becoming an
              Independent Business Owner;
             use the Service; and
             communicate with us.
      We also collect information, such as anonymous usage statistics, by using cookies,
      server logs, and other similar technology as you use the Service.
You do not need to provide Personal Information to visit the Service. All Personal Information
gathered is on a voluntary basis. If you decide to provide us with your Personal Information, we
may store it through whatever means you provided such information (through our Service,
Independent Business Owner, via email or facsimile, etc.). By using the Service, submitting a
signed Customer Order Form to an Independent Business Owner, or submitting a new
Independent Business Owner Agreement to us, you also authorize us to gather, parse, retain, use,
and disclose information to provide the Service and our services as described in this Privacy
Policy, unless we are notified otherwise.
                                                   1


Customer Online Registration. To register as a customer on our Website, you may need to
provide Personal Information, such as your name, email address, and password. You may also
provide other optional information, such as your month and day of birth.
Customer Information from Independent Business Owners. Customers may complete and
sign a Customer Order Form at a Trunk Show and provide it to an Independent Business Owner.
The Independent Business Owner will submit the information to us through the Service so that
we may process your order. Customers may also provide their contact information to
Independent Business Owners without making a purchase, and Independent Business Owners
may save such information in their contact lists on the Service. All Independent Business
Owners must abide by this Privacy Policy and must not share information except in connection
with their Stella & Dot business.
Independent Business Owner Registration. To register as an Independent Business Owner on
our Service, you may need to provide Personal Information, such as your name, social security
number, tax identification number, date of birth, email address, telephone number, postal
address, and password. You may also provide other information, such as your photograph and

for lawful purposes only.
Expressing Interest in Becoming an Independent Business Owner. We collect any Personal

provide in such submissions, including any Personal Information.
Making Payments. When you make payments through the Service or complete a Customer
Order Form, your financial account information, such as your credit card number, will be

account information, but we may receive information from our payment processor about the
payment, such as the date and time of payment.
Social Plug-Ins. The Website may allow you to use social media plug-ins, such as Facebook’s
“like” or Twitter’s “tweet” functions. The social media plug-ins collect information about you,

and not this Privacy Policy, apply to any data collected by the social media plug-ins.

pages or other features. The social media website provider may provide us with information,

you select and purchase products on the Service, we keep a record of your browsing activity and
purchases. Most browsers allow you to refuse cookies from websites or to remove cookies from
your hard drive. If you choose to do this, you may not be able to access or use portions of the
