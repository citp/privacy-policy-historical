		<b>Our Commitment To Privacy</b>
	</p>
	<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we
		provide this notice explaining our online information practices and
		the choices you can make about the way your information is collected
		and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on
		our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable
		information may be requested.</p>

	<p>
		<b>The Information We Collect:</b>
	</p>
	<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the
		KeepHD website. It is collected when you browse around the site and
		back up videos. This will allow us to optimize service for you by
		understanding our demographics.
	
	
	</p><ul>
		<p>
			IP Address <br> Video URL
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>The Way We Use Information:</b>
	</p>

	<p>We use the information you provide about yourself when making a back
		up of a video. We do not share this information with outside parties
		except to the extent necessary to complete that request.</p>
	<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design
		our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an
		advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our
		website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our
		registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be
		used to identify those individuals.</p>
	<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable
		information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones
		described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out
		or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b>
	</p>

	<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure
		the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate
		physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and
		secure the information we collect online.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</b>
	</p>
	<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.
		For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our
		website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our
		website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
	<p>
		<b>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</b>
	</p>

	<p>
		You can access all your personally identifiable information that we
		collect online and maintain by emailing us to <a href="mailto:support@keephd.com"> support@keephd.com</a> . We use
		this procedure to better safeguard your information.
	</p>
	<p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable
		information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.</p>
	<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable
		steps to verify your identity before granting access or making
		corrections.</p>

	<p>
		<b>How To Contact Us</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy
		policies, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@keephd.com"> support@keephd.com</a> .
