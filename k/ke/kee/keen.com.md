  * Current and previous addresses;
  * Your date of birth; and
  * Your social security number or tax identification number.

_Information we collect when you use our Websites and mobile applications_

. We may collect information about the way you interact with our Website, mobile applications, content and advertising. This may include, but is not limited to, device ID, device type, machine ID, geo-location information, computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from our Websites, IP address, ad data, and standard web log information, and any telephone number you provide us or from which you may call or otherwise contact us. 

_Information we collect from other sources_

. We may also obtain information from or about you in other ways. For example, we may verify user information with a service provider or combine your information with additional information we collect from our affiliates and other third parties or sources, as authorized and permitted by law. Also, we collect the information you send to us such as correspondence, customer satisfaction surveys or customer service communications, and user content posted in on-line reviews, comments, forums, or blogs. 

**HOW DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM YOU?**

We collect information that you voluntarily submit to us, including by registering as a member, altering your account information, and using our services. In addition, our Websites and mobile applications include the ability for you and other users to post information via on-line reviews, comments, forums, or blogs. As a result, we will also receive information about you: (i) when you choose to post or otherwise share this information on our Websites or mobile applications, or (ii) when other users post or otherwise share information about you on our Websites or mobile applications. 

We may also collect information from you automatically using the following technologies: 

  * "Cookies" are small data files placed on your computer by the websites you visit and the emails you read and can be used to help recognize you when you return to a website, or when you visit other websites. We, or third party service providers, may use session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to, among other things, measure activity, personalize your experience, remember your viewing preferences, or track your status or progress when accessing our Websites. For some of these purposes our cookies may be tied to personal information. If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete cookies on your computer by following your browser's help file directions. If your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, you may have trouble accessing and using some of the pages and features that are currently on our Websites, or that we may put on our Websites in the future. We do not operate the cookies or tracking technology used by our third party service providers.
  * "Unique Identifiers" are unique strings of characters that are used to identify you, your computer, or your mobile device. Such identifiers may be preset on your computer or mobile device. We may use unique identifiers to recognize you when you visit our Websites or use our mobile applications.
  * "Telephone Caller ID" refers to information automatically transmitted about you when you place a call using our Websites. If you call an advisor's or another member's telephone number that we have provided to you, your caller ID will be recorded by us, but not by the person you are calling. If you call a telephone number not provided by Ingenio, your number may in that instance be recorded by the person called and the use of your phone number by that person will not be controlled by Ingenio or this privacy policy.
  * "Web beacons" or "clear pixels" are small graphic images on a webpage or in an email that can be used for such things as recording the pages and advertisements clicked on by users, or tracking the performance of email marketing campaigns.
  * A "web server log" is a record of activity created by the computer that delivers the webpages you request to your browser. For example, a web server log may record the search term you entered or the link you clicked to bring you the webpage. The web server log also may record information about your browser, such as your IP address and the cookies set on your browser by the server.
  * A "widget" is a small program or application that can be embedded in a web page. Widgets can provide real-time information, such as stock quotes or weather reports, or other functionality, such as an availability button, buy now, or call now button. Widgets are often provided by a third party, and may allow that third party to collect data about users viewing that page. We may also use social media features such as the Facebook Like button. These features may collect your IP address and the page you are visiting on our site and may also set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
  * You can log in to our site using "sign-in services" which we may have now or offer in the future, such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form, or to post information to your account.
  * "Geo-location technologies" refers to technologies that permit us to determine your location. We may ask you to manually provide precise location information on our Websites or to enable your mobile device to send us precise location information. We may also automatically use information from your web server or computer to determine general location information, such as the city in which you live.



In addition to information that we collect from you, we may collect information about you from third parties for purposes such as personalization, ad/listing targeting, optimization and reporting. 

**HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?**

Our primary purpose in collecting information about you is to provide you or connect you with products, services, information, members and advisors that match your interests and preferences. For example, we may use this information to fulfill your request to speak to an advisor or member, fulfill an order, respond to your inquiries, administer your account, contact you regarding customer service and customer surveys, send or communicate marketing and promotional information (including by text or phone), assess your needs and interests in order to better tailor offers and/or advertising, improve our Websites and marketing, conduct research, display content based upon your interests, allow you to search information on our site, list you in our search and directory services, and/or confirm your identification. 

_Financial Information_

. We use financial or payment method information to (i) process payment for any purchases made on our Websites or mobile applications, (ii) enroll you in any discount, promotion, or other program in which you elect to participate, (iii) to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions and (iv) otherwise as needed to manage our business. 

**WHO DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH?**

We may share information about you with third parties in the following situations. 

_Third Party Partners/Networks_

. A third party may use technology (for example, a cookie) to collect information about your use of our Websites or mobile applications so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests. If you would like to opt-out of having third party networks use information that Ingenio has shared with them to target advertising to you please see the instructions in the section titled "What Privacy Choices Do I Have" below. 

_Affiliates_

We may share all types of information with the Ingenio family of companies, including but not limited to companies doing business under the KEEN® brand, INGENIO® brand, LIVEADVICE™ brand, ETHER™brand or other Ingenio products or services for the purpose of fulfilling the services that we provide to our customers and to customize your experience. 

_Blogs, Forums, Online Postings, Testimonials, and Advisor Listings_

. For advertising and other purposes, we may share with the public, or re-publish on a third-party website, any information that you publish (i) if you are an advisor, in an advisor listing, and/or (ii) if you are a non-advisor member, in conjunction with an on-line review, comment, forum, or blog posting regarding our Websites and services. This may include information that identifies you. 

_Business Transition_

. We may share or transfer all types of information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition or other sale or transfer of part or all of Ingenio's assets or business. You will be notified via email and/or a notice on our Website of any change in ownership and related uses of your information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information. 

_On-line Applications & Tools_

. We may offer applications, tools, or widgets on our Websites or in our mobile applications that indicate that they are "powered by" a third party. If you use those applications and tools we may share information you provide as part of that use with that third party. The third party's use of that information is subject to their privacy policy. 

_Law Enforcement_

. We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful, or that we believe may aid a law enforcement investigation. In addition, we reserve the right to release all types of information to law enforcement agencies if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you have violated our policies, or the release of information about you may protect the rights, property, or safety of us or another person. 

_Legal Processes_

. We may share all types of information with others as required by, or permitted by, law. This may include sharing all types of information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us. 

_Service Providers_

. We share all types of information with people and companies that provide us with services. These services may include, among other things, helping us provide products or services that you request, create or maintain our databases, research or analyze the people who use our Websites, and/or process payment information. Unless you consent, we do not permit our service providers to market their own products or services to you directly. We also require our service providers to agree to take reasonable steps to keep the personal information that we provide to them secure. In some instances, we may maintain the look and feel of our site while you are on our service provider's site. You should look for the "privacy policy" link of any page on which you are submitting information to determine if this privacy policy, or another company's privacy policy, governs. 

_Other Third Parties (without your consent)_

. We may share information with other third parties that are not described above. When we do so we endeavor to either aggregate or de-identify the information so that a third party would not be likely to link data to you, your computer, or your device. Aggregation means that we combine the information of numerous people together so that the data does not relate to any one person. De-identify means that we remove or change certain pieces of information that might be used to link data to a particular person. 

_Other Third Parties (with your consent)_

. We may share any information with other third parties that are not described above if you give us consent to do so. 

**HOW DO WE SECURE INFORMATION?**

We take our commitment to securing personal information in our possession seriously. When you provide your credit card number or, as an advisor, your financial account number and social security number or tax identification number, we protect your information during transmission and storage through the use of encryption. For other types of information, we use reasonable measures to help prevent the information from becoming disclosed to individuals who are not described in this policy. 

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer or mobile device. No security measures are perfect and we cannot promise that the information about you will remain secure in all circumstances. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.
