# Keen IO - Analytics Backend as a Service

## Keen Privacy Policy Abstract

Privacy matters, so we try to keep it simple. The true, legal privacy policy is below, but in an effort to push plain-language communication, we wanted to include an abstract. Like most websites and web services, we directly and indirectly collect some information about you. We do so in order to communicate with you and to try to make our service the best it can be. We respect your privacy and only share your information when the business requires it (e.g. payment processing). Your personal information is not a monetization channel for us. We may aggregate lots of user information and use it to learn and share what we’ve learned about analytics, but all personally identifiable information will be stripped from that dataset. Cool? Again, this is just an abstract. The nitty gritty is listed below. If you think our abstract is inconsistent with our policy, let us know. We really want to be on the up and up.
