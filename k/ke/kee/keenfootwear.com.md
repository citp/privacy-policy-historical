You may choose to provide additional information to us when you contact us or otherwise interact with us. 

If you purchase any products through the Websites you may be required to create an online account (your "Account"). You are also able to create an Account with us without placing any orders. You may also be able to place orders without creating an Account via the "Guest Checkout" feature. 

The information that you provide when setting up your Account may include your name, email address and telephone number. If you register to hold an Account with us, you will also have a unique username and password which enables you to access your Account. 

Please note that we will not be storing your payment information, which will be processed and stored by a third party payments company (e.g. PayPal or Paymentech), although we may store certain information like your billing address and the last 4 digits of your card number.

If you contact us via email then we will collect your email address. 

You may also submit personal information in connection with photos/stories/videos for our potential use and/or publication (for example, as part of competitions) or via reviews or our message boards.

The personal information that you provide to us will be used for the purposes made clear to you at the time you submit your information, for example for enabling you to use our Websites and placing orders online and/or for administrative and troubleshooting purposes, and, as explained in section titled "Information we receive from other sources,” we may also use this information for further purposes when combined with other data we collect about you. 

We and our third party marketing partners may also use the information you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with your marketing preferences. However, you will always be able to opt-out of our marketing at any time (see the "How to opt in or opt out of direct marketing" section below).
