      </div>

Cool? Again, this is just an abstract. The nitty gritty is listed below. If you think our abstract is inconsistent with our policy, let us know. We really want to be on the up and up.</p>

      <p>The Keen IO Analytics Service allows businesses to obtain insights into event data by providing an API to collect, analyze, and visualize event data. When providing the Keen Analytics Service, Keen IO acts as a service provider to these businesses or their advisors, consultants or service providers; it does not have a direct relationship with the visitors of these websites.</p>

      <p>Our Customers must inform the affected Data Subjects about the use of our Service and post a link to this Privacy Policy so that these Data Subjects are made aware of the Keen policies with respect to the handling and protection of Personal Data.</p>
      <h3>What Information Keen IO Collects</h3>
      <p>We collect two categories of information:</p>
      <h5>Customer Information</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>We collect information concerning our Customers (the “Customer Information”). These individuals are using the Keen IO Analytics Service for their own purpose, or on behalf of their employer.</li>
        <li>When you sign up for the Service we ask you to complete a registration form so that you can create an account. We also provide you with any API and a key, so that you can connect to the Service and upload your information.</li>
        <li>When you register for an account, we collect certain profile information such as the registrant’s first and last name, and email address, and payment information.</li>
        <li>If you send us feedback, request support, or otherwise interact with us with respect to the Service, we will collect any Personal Data in the email, message, or other communication to us.</li>
        <li>We may combine Personal Data submitted by a user of our Service with information obtained from other sources.</li>
        <li>Like most websites, Keen IO collects certain information provided by a user’s browser, such as Internet protocol address, browser type, operating system, and access time.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Data Subject Information</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>We collect information concerning Data Subjects. Our Service analyzes the usage patterns of these Data Subjects.</li>
        <li>We collect all data that you upload on our platform as part of your use of the Service.</li>
        <li>We do not control what data is uploaded. We request that you do not upload Personal Data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How Information is Collected</h3>
      <h5>Customer Information</h5>
      <p>Customer information is collected through the use of forms (e.g. registration form) or from interaction with the Customer such as in connection with support request, in which case information is collected from electronic or phone communications.</p>
      <p>We use cookies and navigational data, such as Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding a Customer’s use of the Service. A “cookie" is a small data file placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. Customers may disable cookies by adjusting the preferences settings of their browser. Instructions on how to adjust preferences can be found by consulting the “Help" feature of the browser. If you choose to disable cookies when using the Service, some areas of our website may not work properly.</p>
      <h5>Data Subject Information</h5>
      <p>Our Customers upload information from or about Data Subjects onto our Service.</p>
      <p>Keen has no control over what information is uploaded. Keen is not responsible for any information that a Data Subject submits to our Customers, each of which may have its own policies regarding the collection and use of information. If you are a Data Subject, we recommend that you review the policies of our Customers through whom your information may be collected and uploaded on our Service.</p>
      <h3>Do Not Track Notice</h3>
      <p>Some Internet browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features (“DNT”). DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. When turned on, these features send a signal or preference (the "DNT Signal") to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. We do not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on our Site or Services, or on third-party websites or online services where we provide advertisements, content, or are otherwise able to collect information.</p>
      <h5>Third Party Tracking</h5>
      <p>Our Web Site (not the Keen IO Service) may also send third party cookies to your browser, which may collect your online activities across different websites over time. The collection and use of information through these third party cookies are subject to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions of such third party websites. However, you can exercise choice regarding the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising purposes by going to http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>
      <h3>How Keen IO Uses Information</h3>
      <h5>Customer Information</h5>
      <p>In general, we use your Personal Data to respond to requests from a customer or to aid us in serving better our Customer. We may use a Customer’s Personal Data, including information tracking the Customer’s use of our Service, to improve our website and Service.</p>
      <p>We may use a Customer’s Personal Data to periodically send that Customer newsletters, administrative notices, updates regarding the Service and communications promoting the use of our Service. Customers may “opt-out” of such communications as set forth below.</p>
      <h5>Data Subject Information</h5>
      <p>Our Customers use our Service to analyze Data Subjects information to identify behaviors, build profiles, and more generally to better understand the needs and interests of the Data Subjects.</p>
      <p>Keen has no control over the use of the Services by a Customer, and does not have access to the information collected by a Customer, except, as might be necessary to provide support services.</p>
      <p>Keen does not use Data Subject information for its own purposes, other than in aggregated form, combined with other Data Subject information to create internal statistics for financial reporting and billing.</p>
      <h3>How Keen IO Shares Your Information</h3>
