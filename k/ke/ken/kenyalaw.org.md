5. **  The Information We Collect**  
a) Non-Personal Information Collected and How it is Used   
Our Web Site is not set up to automatically collect personally identifiable information from each visitor to our Web Site. It does recognize the home server of visitors,but not e-mail addresses.

The technical information we do collect is used only for internal purposes by our technical support staff.  
   
Our Web Site does track certain information about the visits to our Web Site. For example,we compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Web Site and its individual pages. These aggregated statistics are used internally to improve our Web Site and for product development and marketing purposes generally. Those aggregated statistics may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties,but again,the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.

Providing such information is completely optional. However,failure to provide it may mean that you cannot access and use certain information,materials and services.  
For example,we request information from you when you:
