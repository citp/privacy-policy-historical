# MySA.com: Help

This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for MSA.com, LLC , the website of The San Antonio Express-News, a publication of Hearst Newspapers Partnership, LP and KENS-TV, a station of Belo Corp. (“Belo”). Hearst and Belo are collectively referred to as “Partners”. The Partners are committed to respecting your privacy rights. To protect your Personal Information that you may furnish while visiting mysanantonio.com, the Partners have created the guidelines outlined below. The information collected on mysanantonio.com may be shared with our Partners, and used by them in accordance with the terms set forth in this policy. This privacy policy does not apply to certain website pages of The San Antonio Express-News and KENS-TV that are accessible through links on mysanantonio.com, nor does it apply to information you may provide to us or our Partners offline except as specifically set forth below.

Understanding that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, any changes to this policy will be promptly posted on this page, with an updated "effective date" posted at the end of this policy. 

While visiting mysanantonio.com (the "Site"), we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with the Site. Such Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, street address, and e-mail address. On any page that collects Personal Information, we will specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service, enter you in the promotion you have requested, or respond to your inquiry or comment.

We cannot access cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained therein. Additionally, we cannot learn your e-mail address or any other information about you through the use of a cookie. The only way we would learn such information is if you specifically and voluntarily submit that information to us, for example, through a registration system, or by entering a sweepstakes or promotion.

We use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on the Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are sent by third parties (e.g. advertising agencies or advertising clients). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they contain. We encourage you to contact the advertiser or its privacy policy for more information on these cookies. Links from other Web sites that appear on the Site may also send cookies; but we do not control such activities. 

Mysa.com uses cookies to track usage of the Site and further personalize your experience when you are visiting the Site. By tracking usage, we can best determine what features of the Site best serve the users. 

Overall, the use of cookies helps to give you a more personalized experience at the Site. The information is used to keep our Site fresh and relevant to you the user. Cookies also identify you to our server, allowing you to avoid retyping your e-mail address and password each time you access the Site. 

You may decline to accept cookies sent by the Site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies. However, portions of the Site which require registration will not be accessible to you. In such cases, we ask that you register and provide us with basic information on our registration page, or sign in if previously registered. Cookies enable our server to know that you are a registered user, and will eliminate the need for you to log in each time you access our Site. 

MySA.com logs IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes and to determine site usage. Your IP address does not contain personal information about you. 

We believe in protecting your privacy, and will not share Personal Information with third parties outside of the Partners except as described in this Privacy Policy. We believe we can enhance your experience on our Site with the information you share with us. We use Personal Information about you to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the Site's content, layout, and services. We may also use your Personal Information, such as your e-mail address or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you, to respond to an inquiry from you regarding the information that we have collected, or respond to your comments and suggestions. 

The Partners may match specific and/or aggregated Personal Information with third party data to provide you with product and content offerings that interest you and improve our advertising and marketing efforts. The Partners also may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to potential advertisers, partners, other third parties, our affiliate companies, and for other lawful purposes. 

As part of your experience on our Site, you may receive communications from us related to products and services that might interest you. While we believe these services will enhance your experience at our Site, you will at all times be able to opt out from receiving these communications, either by specifically opting out of these services or by deleting your profile from our database. Please refer to "Opting-Out" for further reference. 

We have today, and will in the future have, arrangements with third party service providers, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and fulfillment services. When you sign up for a service we offer on the Site, we may be required to share Personal Information with that service provider in order to provide the service. These third party providers are required to comply with this policy and protect your information in the same way we do. They are not permitted to retain or use Personal Information for any purpose unrelated to providing the service. 

The Partners may also offer other services as a part of our Site (e.g., car buying service, personalized finance and weather information alerts, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions with unaffiliated third parties). If you choose to use these optional services or opportunities, we may provide some of your Personal Information to these parties. We will not do so without telling you in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services or features of the Site. Some of these third parties may also collect their own Personal Information in connection with providing the service. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy for that portion of the Site prior to disclosing Personal Information. Please refer to "Party Collecting the Information" for further reference. 

When you subscribe online to receive home delivery of the San Antonio Express-News (“EN”), that information will be transferred to the EN and will become a part of the subscriber database maintained by the EN. The information will be used to fulfill your subscription (and may be shared with third parties for that purpose) and to contact you about your subscription. The EN may also share that information with its affiliated newspapers, and use it to contact you, or authorize carefully selected third party marketers to contact you, with offers that it believes may be of interest. 

Any orders you place on the Express News Online Store will also be transferred to the EN. The EN, and third party service providers used on its behalf, will use that information solely to process, fulfill and deliver your order. 

We may provide Personal Information to our affiliated companies in order to improve our marketing and advertising efforts and your experience with our Site. Although this Privacy Policy generally applies only to the Partners, and not to activities or information collected by our offline partners, in the event we share Personal Information you provide us on the Site, we will require that our affiliated companies comply with this policy with respect to that information and protect your information in the same way we do. 

We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information when needed to comply with the law or a legal process, cooperate with investigations of purported unlawful activities, to identify persons violating the law, or in connection with the sale of part or all of either of the Partners or its respective affiliate's stock or assets. 

This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose any information to other parties, whether through, for example, on-line auctions, chat rooms, personal ads, or the like, through third party services or promotions offered on or through the Site or through other web sites throughout the Internet, different policies may apply and Mysa.com shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of such information. 

The Site may offer forums, message boards, or chat rooms as one of the services on the Site. If you disclose personal information in one of these forums, this information can be viewed, collected, and used by others. Mysa.com is not responsible for the use of information you disclose in these forums. We encourage you to consult the Forum Rules regarding the policies and procedures that apply to that portion of the Site. 

Our Site may operate as part of a larger group of sites, and may carry co-branded pages. In addition, other sites may use the Site's or a Partner’s name. Since the Partners do not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of such third parties, and the Partners shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your private information by such parties. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions and review those parties' privacy policies before you disclose your Personal Information to others.

MySA.com cares about the safety of children and their use of the Internet. Therefore, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. In the event that we receive actual knowledge that we have collected such personal information without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practical. 

We respect your privacy and ability to choose whether to share information with us and any third party. You may choose to "opt-out" of sharing Personal Information in several ways. When choosing to use certain features or services on the Site, you can choose whether to share optional Personal Information in connection with the feature or service. If you receive communications from us that you prefer not to receive, you may opt out from receiving these communications, by modifying the contact options in your registration profile.

You may choose to be contacted by any or all of these methods, or "opt-out" by not selecting any contact options. You may change your contact options at any time by following the process described in "Reviewing, Changing, and Deleting Your Personal Information." 

In addition to opting-out by managing your contact preference options, you may opt-out from receiving e-mail communications from any site service by sending your request to [helpcenter@belointeractive.com](mailto:helpcenter@belointeractive.com), or by sending postal mail to:

Certain portions of the Site and certain services provided on the Site, however, do require registration in order to access or use these areas and services. If you choose not to register or provide certain information, these areas will not be accessible to you. 

When any site user chooses to opt-out of a specific advertiser program, to comply with federal law, we will furnish that user’s e-mail address to only the affected advertiser and only for the purpose of ensuring that address is removed from the advertiser’s own distribution lists per the user’s opt-out request. 

California and Canadian residents have the right to know how their information may be shared with third parties who engage in direct marketing activities and this policy explains our practices and how you can opt out of having your information shared for such purposes. From time to time we may make our customer lists available to companies that sell goods and services that we believe would be of interest. We may compile these lists from customer orders placed both offline and online. Customers have the option of having their names and identifying information removed from those lists (subject to certain exceptions and limitations in applicable laws) by contacting us at [specify email address and link]. 

We may also from time to time make our customer lists available for direct marketing purposes to other entities (other than the partners) that are affiliated with us. If you would like to be removed from those lists, contact us at [specify email address and link]. 

You may access all of the Personal Information that we collect from you online and maintain by using the procedure that follows. We use this procedure to better safeguard your Personal Information.
