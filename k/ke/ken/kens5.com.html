	Privacy Policy </font></b></font> 
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This privacy 
	policy describes how MSA.com, LLC("MySA") treats the personally 
	identifiable information that is collected about you when you visit 
	MySanAntonio.com, the website of The San Antonio Express-News, a 
	publication of Hearst Newspapers Partnership, LP ("Hearst") 
	and KENS TV, a station of Belo Communications, Inc. ("Belo"). 
	Hearst and Belo are referred to as our "Partners". The 
	information collected on MySanAntonio.com may be shared with our 
	Partners, and used by them in accordance with the terms set forth 
	in this policy. This privacy policy also applies to those website 
	pages of The San Antonio Express-News and KENS TV that are accessible 
	through links on MySanAntonio.com. If you have any questions or 
	concerns about these privacy guidelines, please send an e-mail to 
	webmaster at: <a href="mailto:feedback@mysanantonio.com">feedback@MySanAntonio.com</a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	Any information you provide when you visit web sites other than 
	those covered by this policy (including other web sites affiliated 
	with our Partners) or when you purchase any products or services 
	that may be offered or advertised on our web site by companies other 
	than MySA is subject to the privacy policies of the third party 
	organizations who run and/or own these web sites. This policy also 
	does not apply to information you may provide to us or our Partners 
	offline.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Your IP Address:</b><br>
	An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your 
	computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers -- the computers 
	that send out Web pages -- automatically identify your computer 
	by its IP address. MySA collects IP addresses for the purposes of 
	system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, 
	and to audit the use of our site. MySA does not normally link IP 
	addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that 
	a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous 
	to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when 
	we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and 
	policies or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers 
	or others. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Cookies:</b><br>
	Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an 
	individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make 
	Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're 
	at a site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll 
	find them at most major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set 
	up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies 
	or indicate when a cookie is being sent. You may occasionally get 
	cookies from our advertisers or from our affiliate sites. MySA does 
	not control these cookies, and they may or may not collect personally 
	identifiable information. The use of advertising cookies sent by 
	third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. MySA (or 
	third party service providers on our behalf) may also use cookies 
	to collect aggregate information about web site users on an anonymous 
	basis. We may share aggregate demographic and usage information 
	with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and 
	other third parties, including our Partners, for any business purpose.</font></p>
	<p></p>
	<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Collection 
	of Personally Identifiable Information:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
	MySA and its Partners generally collect personally identifiable 
	information when you specifically and knowingly provide us with 
	it. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete 
	a survey, subscribe to the Express-News, or subscribe to our newsletters, 
	you will be asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, 
	name, phone number, and sometimes shipping address. Optional information 
	such as your age or gender may also be requested.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MySA and its 
	Partners use this information to provide you with the service you 
	have requested. If you subscribe to the Express-News, we may use 
	your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing 
	address to send you your magazine. Similarly, if you enter online 
	sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are 
	a winner.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you elect 
	to customize the site, we collect your log-in, encrypted password, 
	first and last name, email address, zip code, gender, birthdate, 
	and income level. We will also give you the option to tell us your 
	news preferences, favorite hobbies, whether you subscribe to the 
	Express-News and how often you watch KENS-TV. We use this information 
	to provide you with the customized news and features you have indicated 
	you prefer.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may also 
	use information you provide to serve you ads, and, if you have given 
	your consent for us to do so, to send you e-mails concerning offers 
	from our partners and other third parties that we think may be of 
	interest to you. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you conduct 
	e-commerce with one of the e-commerce affiliates to which our site 
	is linked, personal information such as your email and home address 
	may be collected by the vendor's server and made available to us. 
	We do not, however, collect your credit card information. We may 
	use the information provided to us on an anonymous aggregated basis 
	for purposes of analyzing traffic and usage.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Disclosure 
	of Personal Information: </b><br>
	MySA and its Partners may share or disclose personally identifiable 
	information about you to other companies or individuals other than 
	our partners when:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- We have your 
	consent to share the information; <br>
	- We need to share your information to provide the product or service 
	you have requested; <br>
	- We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf 
	of MySA and its Partners to provide a product or service to you. 
	(Unless otherwise stated, these companies do not have any right 
	to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them 
	beyond what is necessary to assist us); <br>
	- We comply with subpoenas or court orders, or need to collect a 
	debt of money you may owe us:<br>
	- The entity to whom the information is disclosed is one under control 
	of, or under common control with MySA or its partners (for these 
	purposes, a company controlling twenty (20%) percent or more of 
	the voting stock of another entity shall be deemed to control such 
	entity); or<br>
	- The disclosure is made in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, 
	exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) 
	of all or a portion of the business conducted by the web sites to 
	which this policy applies. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Children:</b><br>
	The sites covered by this policy are not intended for use by children, 
	especially those under age 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to 
	provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, 
	forums and chats. MySA does not knowingly collect personal information 
	from children under the age of 13.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Security:</b><br>
	The importance of security for all personally identifiable information 
	associated with users is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great 
	care in providing secure transmission of your information from your 
	PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the 
	Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while 
	we strive to protect your personal information, MySA can't ensure 
	or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or 
	from our online products or services, and you do so at your own 
	risk. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Choice/Opt-Out:</b><br>
	To keep you in control of communications directed to you, we allow 
	you to opt-out of the following services: receiving communications 
	from MySA and its Partners about new features or services, and receiving 
	communications about offers from third-party companies that offer 
	a product or service that we think would be of value to you. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Correct/Update:</b><br>
	MySA gives users the option of changing and/or modifying information 
	previously provided. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Non-US Users:</b><br>
	If you are located outside of the United States, please note that 
	the information you provide to us will be transferred to the United 
	States. By using this web site, you consent to this transfer.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Changes to 
	Privacy Policy: </b><br>
	MySA may change this policy from time to time in its discretion. 
	Your continued use of our sites indicates your consent to this privacy 
	policy and any amended versions of it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This policy 
	was last updated on October 25, 2002.</font></p>

	the Web Site:</b><br>
