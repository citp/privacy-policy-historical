                    tells you about the information the company or its subsidiaries 
                    or affiliates collect through the services available on our 
                    web site, DNC Parks &amp; Resorts at KSC, Inc. (the "Site") 
                    and the membership programs, how we use that information and 
                    how you can opt out of certain uses of information we may 
                    collect. By using our services and accessing our Site, you 
                    are consenting to the information collection and use practices 
                    described in this statement, as modified from time to time 
                    by us. If this Privacy policy is not acceptable to you, do 
                    not use this Site. If we decide to materially change our privacy 
                    policy, we will post a new statement on our Site and notify 
                    you of our new privacy policy by e-mail. Therefore, we encourage

                  <p><b>Information About You.</b><br>
                    We collect several types of information on our Site. We collect 
                    "Personal Information", which, generally speaking, 
                    is information that can be used to identify you individually, 
                    such as your first and last name, home address and email address. 
                    We also collect "Non-personal Information", which 
                    is information about you that does not itself identify you 
                    individually. Examples of Non-personal Information include 
                    age range and gender. We also collect "Aggregate Information", 
                    which is information about use of our site, such as pages 
                    visited on our Site. The information we collect depends on 
                    what services you use on our Site. The following is a more 
                    detailed explanation of these types of information as well 
                    as when and how we collect and use it.</p>
                  <p><b>Personal Information.</b><br>

                    including your first and last name, e-mail address, home address, 
                    home phone number, personal interests and preferred vacation/leisure 
                    destinations. We also collect and store access information 
                    related to your account including user name and user password.

                    your privacy preferences. As described below, you may change

                  <p><b>Surveys.</b><br>
                    From time-to-time we may post surveys on our Site. The surveys 
                    may request demographic information (such as age range, gender, 
                    areas of interest, and familiarity with DNC Parks &amp; Resorts 
                    at KSC, Inc. or our products and services) and customer feedback. 
                    Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and 
                    with each request you will have the choice of whether or not

                    (a) to conform with the law, respond to claims or comply with 
                    legal process served on DNC Parks &amp; Resorts at KSC, Inc. 
                    (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order);<br>
                    (b) to enforce or apply our policies or agreements (including

                    (d) if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate 
                    danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires 
                    disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records 
                    without delay.</p>
                  <p><b>Company Sale.</b><br>
                    Information collected through our Site is considered a trade 
                    secret of DNC Parks &amp; Resorts at KSC, Inc.. As the owner 
                    of such information, we may disclose or sell such information 
                    as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale to 
                    a third party of our company or a portion of our assets.</p>
                  <p><b>Aggregate Information.</b><br>
                    We collect aggregate information about you and your use of 
                    our Site whenever you visit us online ("Aggregate Information"). 
                    For instance, we may collect various forms of "click 
                    stream" information such as entry and exit points for 
                    our Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, 
                    page views, impressions, and operating system and browser 
                    type. In addition, when users request pages on our Site, our 
                    servers automatically log their IP addresses. An IP address 
                    is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer 
                    whenever you are surfing the Web.</p>
                  <p>We also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed 
                    to DNC Parks &amp; Resorts at KSC, Inc. from affiliate Web 
                    sites and the purchases that result from this traffic. This 
                    information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual 
                    purchase.</p>
                  <p>This Aggregate Information generally will not personally 
                    identify you or be correlated to you individually for external 
                    purposes. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, 
                    report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate 
                    Information, provided that, such information does not personally 
                    identify you. When we share such information with other companies, 
                    it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be 
                    used to contact you. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information 
                    to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal 
                    Information under this statement.</p>
                  <p><b>Links to Other Sites.</b><br>
                    Please be aware that we provide links to third-party Web sites 
                    as a service to our users, and that we are not responsible 
                    for the content or information collection practices of those 
                    pages. Please note that these Web sites' privacy policies 
                    may differ from those of DNC Parks &amp; Resorts at KSC, Inc.. 
                    We encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices 
                    before providing them with information.</p>
                  <p><b>Children.</b> <br>
                    Our Site is a general audience site that is not designed nor 
                    intended to collect Personal Information from children under 
                    the age of 13. To respect the privacy of children and to comply 
                    with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, children 
                    under the age of 13 should not provide any Personal Information 
                    on this Site. We ask that parents supervise their children 
                    while online.</p>
                  <p><b>Security. </b><br>
                    When we ask for credit card data, it is transferred over a 
                    Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line provided you are using a 
                    SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or 
                    Netscape Navigator. This ensures that your information is 
                    encrypted as it travels through the Internet. This secure 
                    mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted 
                    from your computer. You will know that you are in "secure 
                    mode" when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand 
                    or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the 
                    locked position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, 
                    the first characters of the site address will change from 
                    "http" to "https".</p>
                  <p><b>Opting-Out of Promotional Materials. </b><br>
                    As noted above, we may use your e-mail address and other contact 
                    information provided to us through the Site to send you promotional 
                    materials from us. If you do not want to receive such promotional 
                    information, you can change your privacy preference and remove
