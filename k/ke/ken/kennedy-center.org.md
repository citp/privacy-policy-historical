Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, address, email address, or phone number, or other information that is not otherwise publicly available, including information related to your usage of the Kennedy Center's products and services. 

You may visit and browse the Kennedy Center's websites as often as you like without logging in and no personal information about your visit will be collected. 

While you are logged into your Kennedy Center account to purchase tickets or use other online services, you are not anonymous to us online. The Kennedy Center collects personal information when you make a purchase or a contribution online, register an account, utilize our network, request information about our products and services, participate in a promotion or an online survey, contact the Kennedy Center with a question or suggestion, apply for employment with the Kennedy Center, and when you attend certain special events where heightened security is necessary. 

**How Information is Collected**

__We may ask you to provide specific information._ _ Depending on the nature of your interaction with the Kennedy Center, we may ask you for information such as your name, phone number, physical address, birth date, company related information, email address, credit card information including expiration date and billing address, and product preferences. Under certain less common and special circumstances, we may ask you for other information such as your social security number. In such cases, we will inform you of the reason we are requesting that information and how it will be used.

__We may use Cookies, tracking tags and other technology._ _The Kennedy Center uses cookies and other tracking mechanisms across our websites and social media platforms. These technologies work by sending a small amount of data from our websites which is stored on your computer's hard drive ("cookies"). Our site can then read this cookie, which helps us keep track of how you use our websites and remember your preferences. Many web browsers accept cookies by default but contain an option for you to turn off cookie acceptance if you prefer. If you turn off acceptance, there may be some features of our websites that will not be available to you and some webpages may not display properly. 

In addition, the Kennedy Center incorporates tracking or measurement tools into our websites and other communications which enable us to track your browsing activity on Kennedy Center websites as well as across social media platforms or other non-Kennedy Center websites and applications (known as "tracking tags", "web beacons," "action tags" or "single-pixel gifs"). If you utilize services which are linked to these tracking tags, these third-party services may also provide non-personal information to the Kennedy Center about your activity on non-Kennedy Center websites and social media platforms, which we may utilize to increase the effectiveness of our promotional efforts and to personalize our services and offerings for you. 

Cookies, tracking tags, and embedded third-party features provide overall usage patterns for our websites that we use for analysis and to provide personalized services and advertising content.   Your browsing may be tracked by these third-party services for their own use and for their clients.  Such tracking could give information about you as an individual to third-parties based on your browsing activity, but this information will not include personal information unless you specifically provide it. 

The ability of tracking tags to gather and use your information through any **** third-party services is governed by that service's privacy policy, which may differ from the Kennedy Center's policies.   The Kennedy Center is not responsible for the privacy practices or the use of the data collected by these third-party services. ****
