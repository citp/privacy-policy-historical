					KEBAT.COM respects the privacy of its customers and visitors and is committed
					to protecting the personal information of its customers and visitors. This
					Privacy Policy is only applicable to the site, http://www.KEBAT.COM (the "Site"), and
					not any other websites that are accessible from the Site, each of which may have
					data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially
					from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of
					such websites.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED BY THE SITE</strong><br>
					Like many websites, we collect and analyze certain user behavior on the Site
					and store it in log files. This information is non-personally identifiable and
					may include, but is not limited to, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser
					type, referring/exit pages, the date &amp; time, and search queries. We also collect
					information regarding user activities on the Site. We use this information to
					analyze website traffic, improve the performance of our search services, improve our
					geo-targeted advertising services, administer the website and prevent fraud.
					This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to users and to
					understand which parts of the Site and services are of most interest to them.<br>
					<br>
					On occasion we may share your non-personally identifiable information that we
					collect to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
					suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of
					any person, violations of KEBAT.COM's Terms of Use, in order to diagnose a
					problem with our server, to administer the Site or as we otherwise deem necessary in
					our sole and absolute discretion. We will transfer information about you if
					KEBAT.COM is acquired by or merged with another company and this may occur with or
					without notice to you. Also, we will provide your personal information to respond
					to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process or to establish or exercise our
					legal rights or defend against legal claims.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</strong>:<br>
					We track user behavior and use of our services through the use of cookies and
					web beacons. A “cookie” is a small text file that a website can place on your
					computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your
					activities on the website or to make it easier to use certain website functions.
					The cookie transmits this information back to the website's computer. Many users
					do not know that “cookies” are being placed on their computers when they visit a
					website. If you want to know when this happens, or prevent it from happening,
					you can set your browser to warn you when a website attempts to place a “cookies”
					on your computer.<br>
					<br>
					We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user
					preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people search and which advertisements
					they click on. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session
					ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on
					your computer for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by
					following directions provided in your Internet browser's “help” file. We use
					cookies on the Site to provide our service, including without limitation, in the
					following ways: We use cookies to track when a search user clicks on a sponsored
					listing, and in some cases we use cookies and web beacons to determine whether
					the click resulted in an actual purchase of products or services from the
					advertiser's site. This information is used to determine the effectiveness of our
					advertising services. We also use cookies to analyze how visitors, in the aggregate,
					use the Site, in order to make the Site as useful as possible for them. We do not
					use cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information. Most
					browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to
					refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some of our
					services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. We also use web
					beacons (a small transparent image, iframe, script, object or other transparent
					tag embedded in a web page) on some of our web pages and advertising services.
					Whenever the user opens the page with a browser, the web beacon or tag is
					requested from the server storing it, allowing the server to take notice of the
					download. As a result, our servers (or the Site analytics company's servers) are
					informed of when the web page has been viewed.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>:<br>
					We do not collect any personally identifiable information or financial
					information like credit card numbers, postal address, financial statements, etc. We do
					however collect a user's name and email address (if and when a user voluntarily
					chooses to provide) when he submits his feedback on ways to improve his
					experience on KEBAT.COM<br>
					<br>
					<strong>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</strong>:<br>
					The Site includes links to thousands of other websites whose privacy practices
					may differ from those of KEBAT.COM. KEBAT.COM does not control the websites of
					third parties that are linked from the Site or through our services, and is not
					responsible for information included in those services. If you submit personal
					information to any of those websites, your information is subject to their privacy
					statements. KEBAT.COM's Privacy Policy applies only to our own services, and
					does not apply to any other website. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy
					statement of any website you visit. KEBAT.COM is not responsible for the privacy
					practices or the content of other websites.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES</strong>:<br>
					KEBAT.COM may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We may notify you
					about significant changes in the way we treat your information by sending a
					notice to you, although we are not required to do so, or we may simply place a
					notice on the Site. Not withstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to change
					this Privacy Policy without any notice whatsoever to you and for whatever reason
					we deem appropriate under the circumstances. Your continued use of the Site and
					our services will be construed as your acceptance of any such change. We
					encourage you to periodically check back and review this Privacy Policy so that you
					always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose
					it.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>TERMS OF USE</strong>:<br>
					Use of the Site and our services are governed by the provisions contained in
					the Terms of Use located <a href="/termsofuse.php" style="font-size: 14px; text-decoration: none;">here</a>. Your use, or access, of the Site and our Service constitutes your agreement to
					be bound by these provisions. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
					YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE OR THE SERVICE.<br>
