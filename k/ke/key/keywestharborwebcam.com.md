You may visit our sites anonymously and are not required to register or sign-in.

If you choose to fill out and submit a contact or "wave request" form, you may be asked to enter your name, e-mail address or phone number.

Our InletPhotos.com and PTZtv WebcamWare websites can involve eCommerce transactions if you choose to purchase merchandise from them. Those transactions necessitate the sharing of more personal information, including credit card numbers.

InletPhotos.com transactions are hosted and operated by SmugMug, Inc. and their privacy policy is [here](http://www.smugmug.com/aboutus/privacy/).

WebcamWare transactions are hosted and operated by CafePress, Inc. and their privacy policy is [here](http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/help/index.aspx?page=privacy_policy.aspx).

**What are cookies?  
 **

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enable the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our sites.

Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visits to our sites and/or other sites on the Internet.

Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting the [ads preference manager](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/) or alternatively,  to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest based advertising by visiting [aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).

In addition, our sites use cookies to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and features in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.  
 

At this time, we contract with Google Analytics to provide site traffic analysis services and their privacy policy is [here](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).

We do not place or use PTZtv cookies on any of our webcam websites.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

**Third party links**

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our websites. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
