Your privacy is important to us. We will not use or share your personal information provided to us online for any purpose other than to reply to your email, to contact you regarding customer service issues, warranty information, product information or to contact you regarding the submission of product ideas. We protect against unauthorized disclosures by limiting access only to those of our employees who need the information to do their jobs. We may also disclose information about you or your recreational vehicle as required by law, in conjunction with a government inquiry, a product recall or in litigation or dispute resolution. 

 **Children's Privacy  **  
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are under thirteen, please do not submit any personally identifiable information through our website. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide personally identifiable information on our website without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us through this website, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

 **Using the Information We Collect**  
We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:

  * to answer questions about your recreational vehicle;
  * to provide the services, parts, and repairs you request;
  * to send you our brochures and other offerings;
  * to contact you about the status of your dealer;
  * to identify your product and service preferences, so that you can be informed of new or additional products, services, and promotions that might be of interest to you;
  * to notify you of product recalls or provide other information concerning products you have purchased; and
  * to improve our products, customer service, and overall customer experience.



We may share information about you with our suppliers for the exclusive purpose of providing customer service, honoring the Keystone Limited Warranty or the various component warranties.
