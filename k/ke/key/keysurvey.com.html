        Key Survey is treated with the utmost confidentiality. Survey Software Services Inc.
        will not sell or rent out any personal information gathered from clients. We will
        make no public release of any personal information that is collected through our
        proprietary survey tool. All company-specific information gathered through Key Survey
        will be the property of the customer. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure,
        to maintain data accuracy and to ensure the appropriate use of information, we have
        put into place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the
        information that we collect online. We use encryption when collecting or transferring
        data such as credit card information.<br><br>
        <a name="p10"></a>
        <div class="headGrayd">Credit Card Information Protection</div><br>
        Whenever you place an order with Key Survey, you do so over a secure connection
        utilizing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This ensures that your personal information is
        not at risk. Additionally, we store your credit card information in a secure location
        in an encrypted format, which can be accessed only by authorized personnel. When you
        register with us or login to our website, you can use a secure connection, ensuring

        secured location. These e-mail addresses are kept on the server for tracking and
        click notification purposes. Much like survey data, these addresses are yours, not
        the property of Survey Software Services Inc. Key Survey Customer Support team may
        examine these lists for support and troubleshooting purposes. Survey Software
        Services Inc. will never use or sell these e-mail addresses to anyone; any attempt
        to access your e-mail addresses without your authorization will be prosecuted.<br><br>
