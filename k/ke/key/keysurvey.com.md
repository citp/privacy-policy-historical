Two tables of WorldAPP cookies are listed below, based upon whether or not the cookie recipient is (1) a survey or forms respondent, or (2) website visitor or survey or forms administrative user.

#### 1\. Survey and Forms Respondent Cookies

WorldAPP's default survey and forms technology leverages cookies to enable some survey or form functionality. These cookies are utilized expressly for survey or form performance, and are never collected by WorldAPP for additional purposes, and are strictly confidential.

Each survey/form cookie, along with its purpose and lifespan, is listed below.

Cookie Name  |  Purpose  |  Lifespan   
---|---|---  
**JSessionID** |  This cookie lasts until the browser is closed.  
It is used to identify your session with the server, so the server recognizes its conversation with a particular user.  
These are necessary for a smooth experience with the application.  |  Session   
**SurveyID** |  If you are taking a survey on the system, it stores this cookie on your computer.  
This is so that if you leave the survey and return later, you can continue where you left off. It works together with the RID cookie to deliver your survey content to you upon your return.  
If you don't use this cookie, and the survey is not set up to use username and password or unique URLs, then the server will give someone returning to their survey a brand new survey. A duplicate response will likely be created in the reports as well.  |  10 years   
**RID** |  RID (Respondent ID) is a cookie that works with the SurveyID cookie to identify someone who has left a survey and is now returning. If you don't use this cookie, and the survey is not set up to use username and password or unique URLs, then the server will give someone returning to their survey a brand new survey. A duplicate response will likely be created in the reports as well.  |  10 years   
**CIntVerification** |  This cookie is used to test to see if your web browser has cookies enabled. The WorldAPP server also uses this cookie to help improve the server and web page speed by load-balancing traffic.  |  1 day   
**BigipServerksDispatcher, BigipServerksNginx, BigipServerKsVoting, BigipServerksVoting360, BigipServerksMail, BigipServerksReport** |  These cookies are used to improve server and web page speeds by allowing the server to recognize you and send your traffic to the fastest sub-server. Without these cookies a user always talks to the same servers, and new users will talk to the less burdened servers.  |  1 day   
  
#### 2\. Website Visitors and Survey or Forms Administrator User Cookies

Additionally to those there some cookies that are set for the Key Survey website visitors and Key Survey application administrative users. The list of the cookies is presented below.
