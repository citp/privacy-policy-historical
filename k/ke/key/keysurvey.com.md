Two tables of WorldAPP cookies are listed below, based upon whether or not the cookie recipient is (1) a survey or forms respondent, or (2) website visitor or survey or forms administrative user.

#### 1\. Survey and Forms Respondent Cookies

WorldAPP's default survey and forms technology leverages cookies to enable some survey or form functionality. These cookies are utilized expressly for survey or form performance, and are never collected by WorldAPP for additional purposes, and are strictly confidential.

Each survey/form cookie, along with its purpose and lifespan, is listed below.

Cookie Name  | Purpose | Lifespan  
---|---|---  
JSessionID | This cookie lasts until the browser is closed. It is used to identify your session with the server, so the server recognizes its conversation with a particular user. These are necessary for a smooth experience with the application.  | Session  
SurveyID |  If you are taking a survey on the system, it stores this cookie on your computer. This is so that if you leave the survey and return later, you can continue where you left off. It works together with the RID cookie to deliver your survey content to you upon your return. If you don't use this cookie, and the survey is not set up to use username and password or unique URLs, then the server will give someone returning to their survey a brand new survey. A duplicate response will likely be created in the reports as well.  | 10 years  
RID | RID (Respondent ID) is a cookie that works with the SurveyID cookie to identify someone who has left a survey and is now returning. If you don't use this cookie, and the survey is not set up to use username and password or unique URLs, then the server will give someone returning to their survey a brand new survey. A duplicate response will likely be created in the reports as well. | 10 years  
CIntVerification | This cookie is used to test to see if your web browser has cookies enabled. The WorldAPP server also uses this cookie to help improve the server and web page speed by load-balancing traffic. | 1 day

BigipServerKSMkt, BigipServerksMain | These cookies are used to improve server and web page speeds by allowing the server to recognize you and send your traffic to the fastest sub-server.

This functionality also helps to prevent data corruption in the case that a load balanced server stops working and another server starts handling those users. | 1 day  
SecureToken | If the user chooses "remember me" option when logging into the application, this cookie will be created and will store an encrypted version of the username and password so the server can actually remember the users login credentials. | 1 week
