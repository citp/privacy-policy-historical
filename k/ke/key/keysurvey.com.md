  * A detailed description of the complaint, incident, or vulnerability
  * Date and time of the occurrence
  * Individuals involved in the occurrence
  * Tool output

The information Customers share with WorldAPP as part of this process is kept confidential within WorldAPP and will not be shared with third parties without the Customer’s permission.

If the case has been confirmed, WorldAPP will work to investigate and validate the reported incident or vulnerability. WorldAPP classifies any and all confirmed privacy and security incident reports as Critical and aims for a maximum of one business hour initial response time. If additional information is required in order to validate or reproduce the issue, WorldAPP will work with the Customer to obtain it.

In the event that violations of WorldAPP Privacy and/or Security Policy are discovered, WorldAPP will immediately seek a solution to the violating actions.

Upon completion of the investigation, information on the resolution will be delivered to the Customer.

The individual has a right, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration or lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

### Service Providers

We use other third-party service providers necessary to provide information, products or services to you. For instance, we may use e-mail service providers to send out e-mails on our behalf, and a payment processing company to bill you for services. We only share the information we collect with the third parties for the purposes of providing that service.

### Security

The security of your personal information is of great importance to WorldAPP. We use various kinds of technical, physical, electronic, and administrative security mechanisms that are designed to protect your and our Customer’s data from loss, damage, deletion, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or alteration.

If you choose to upgrade your account on www.keysurvey.co.uk, www.keysurvey.com, www.keysurvey.fr, fr.form.com and form.com via logging into your account. You do so over a secure connection utilizing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This ensures that your personal information is not at risk. All transactions are executed with VeriSign technology, a web -based transaction management tool. When you register with us or log in to our website, you can use a secure connection, ensuring that no one can steal your username and password, and use that to access any other information about you.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our website, you can send e-mail us at [support@worldapp.com](mailto:support@worldapp.com).
