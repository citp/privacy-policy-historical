<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At <em>keybr.com</em> we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on–going operation of one of our services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, <em>keybr.com</em> collects non–personally–identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. <em>keybr.com’s</em> purpose in collecting non–personally identifying information is to better understand how <em>keybr.com’s</em> visitors use its website. From time to time, <em>keybr.com</em> may release non–personally–identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p><em>keybr.com</em> also collects potentially personally–identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. <em>keybr.com</em> does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally–identifying information, as described below.</p>
<h2>Gathering of Personally–Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to <em>keybr.com’s</em> websites choose to interact with <em>keybr.com</em> in ways that require <em>keybr.com</em> to gather personally–identifying information. The amount and type of information that <em>keybr.com</em> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with <em>keybr.com</em> are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, <em>keybr.com</em> collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitors interaction with <em>keybr.com</em>. <em>keybr.com</em> does not disclose personally–identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally–identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website–related activities.</p>
<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p><em>keybr.com</em> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, <em>keybr.com</em> may monitor the most popular pages on this site. <em>keybr.com</em> may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, <em>keybr.com</em> does not disclose personally–identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h2>Protection of Certain Personally–Identifying Information</h2>
<p><em>keybr.com</em> discloses potentially personally–identifying and personally–identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on _keybr.com_s behalf or to provide services available at _keybr.com_s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using <em>keybr.com’s</em> websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. <em>keybr.com</em> will not rent or sell potentially personally–identifying and personally–identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, <em>keybr.com</em> discloses potentially personally–identifying and personally–identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when <em>keybr.com</em> believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of <em>keybr.com</em>, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an <em>keybr.com</em> website and have supplied your email address, <em>keybr.com</em> may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whats going on with <em>keybr.com</em> and our products. We primarily use our website to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. <em>keybr.com</em> takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally–identifying and personally–identifying information.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitors computer, and that the visitors browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. <em>keybr.com</em> uses cookies to help <em>keybr.com</em> identify and track visitors, their usage of <em>keybr.com</em> website, and their website access preferences. <em>keybr.com</em> visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using _keybr.com_s websites, with the drawback that certain features of <em>keybr.com’s</em> websites may not function properly, or you may not be granted access to parts of the website, without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, <em>keybr.com</em> may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in <em>keybr.com’s</em> sole discretion. <em>keybr.com</em> encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p></article></main><nav id="Nav" class="Body-nav"><div class="NavMenu"><div class="NavMenu-item"><div class="Avatar" title="Anonymous"><a class="Avatar-link" href="/account"><svg class="Icon Avatar-image" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M14.695 17.105c-0.745 0.575-1.7 0.895-2.695 0.895s-1.95-0.32-2.695-0.895c-0.215-0.17-0.53-0.13-0.7 0.090s-0.13 0.53 0.090 0.7c0.915 0.71 2.090 1.105 3.305 1.105s2.39-0.395 3.305-1.105c0.22-0.17 0.26-0.485 0.090-0.7-0.17-0.22-0.485-0.26-0.7-0.090z"></path><path d="M9.5 12.5c0 0.552-0.448 1-1 1s-1-0.448-1-1c0-0.552 0.448-1 1-1s1 0.448 1 1z"></path><path d="M12 0c-6.625 0-12 5.375-12 12s5.375 12 12 12 12-5.375 12-12-5.375-12-12-12zM19.96 14.82c-1.090 3.74-4.27 6.455-8.040 6.455-3.775 0-6.96-2.725-8.045-6.475-1.19-0.1-2.125-1.18-2.125-2.51 0-1.27 0.855-2.315 1.965-2.495v-0.005c2.090-1.465 3.805-3.49 4.095-5.050l0.005 0.005v-0.015c1.355 2.625 6.3 5.19 11.825 5.060 0.1-0.015 0.195-0.035 0.295-0.035 1.275 0 2.31 1.135 2.31 2.535 0.005 1.39-1.020 2.52-2.285 2.53z"></path><path d="M16.5 12.5c0 0.552-0.448 1-1 1s-1-0.448-1-1c0-0.552 0.448-1 1-1s1 0.448 1 1z"></path></svg><span class="Avatar-name">Anonymous</span></a></div></div><div class="NavMenu-item"><a class="NavLink" href="/practice" title="Practice typing lessons"><svg class="Icon NavLink-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M6 16h12v2H6v-2zm0-3v2H2v-2h4zm1 2v-2h3v2H7zm4 0v-2h2v2h-2zm3 0v-2h3v2h-3zm4 0v-2h4v2h-4zM2 10h3v2H2v-2zm17 2v-2h3v2h-3zm-1 0h-2v-2h2v2zM8 12H6v-2h2v2zm4 0H9v-2h3v2zm3 0h-2v-2h2v2zM2 9V7h2v2H2zm3 0V7h2v2H5zm3 0V7h2v2H8zm3 0V7h2v2h-2zm3 0V7h2v2h-2zm3 0V7h5v2h-5z"></path></svg><span class="NavLink-label">Practice</span></a></div><div class="NavMenu-item"><a class="NavLink" href="/profile" title="See detailed statistics about your results"><svg class="Icon NavLink-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M17.453 15.184L22 7.31V21H2V3h2v12.536l5.495-9.518 6.512 3.76 4.233-7.332 1.732 1-5.233 9.064-6.512-3.76L4.31 19h2.263l4.39-7.563 6.491 3.747z"></path></svg><span class="NavLink-label">Profile</span></a></div><div class="NavMenu-item"><a class="NavLink" href="/help" title="Read instruction manual"><svg class="Icon NavLink-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M11 18h2v-2h-2v2zm1-16C6.48 2 2 6.48 2 12s4.48 10 10 10 10-4.48 10-10S17.52 2 12 2zm0 18c-4.41 0-8-3.59-8-8s3.59-8 8-8 8 3.59 8 8-3.59 8-8 8zm0-14c-2.21 0-4 1.79-4 4h2c0-1.1.9-2 2-2s2 .9 2 2c0 2-3 1.75-3 5h2c0-2.25 3-2.5 3-5 0-2.21-1.79-4-4-4z"></path></svg><span class="NavLink-label">Help</span></a></div><div class="NavMenu-item"><a class="NavLink" href="/high-scores" title="See the table of the fastest typists"><svg class="Icon NavLink-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M2 2v9c0 1 1 2 2 2h2.2c.4 2 1.7 3.7 4.8 4v2.1c-2.2.2-3 1.3-3 2.6v.3h8v-.3c0-1.3-.8-2.4-3-2.6V17c3.1-.3 4.4-2 4.8-4H20c1 0 2-1 2-2V2h-4c-.9 0-2 1-2 2H8c0-1-1.1-2-2-2H2zm2 2h2v7H4V4zm14 0h2v7h-2V4zM8 6h8v5.5c0 1.933-.585 3.5-4 3.5s-4-1.567-4-3.5V6z"></path></svg><span class="NavLink-label">High Scores</span></a></div><div class="NavMenu-item"><a class="NavLink" href="/multiplayer" title="Play online against other users"><svg class="Icon NavLink-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M16 6l3 4h2c1.11 0 2 .89 2 2v3h-2a3 3 0 0 1-6 0H9a3 3 0 0 1-6 0H1v-3c0-1.11.89-2 2-2l3-4h10zm-5.5 1.5H6.748L4.864 10H10.5V7.5zm1.5 0V10h5.136l-1.884-2.5H12zm-6 6a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0 3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0-3zm12 0a1.5 1.5 0 1 0 0 3 1.5 1.5 0 0 0 0-3z"></path></svg><span class="NavLink-label">Multiplayer</span></a></div></div></nav></div><footer class="Body-footer"><p class="FinePrint">Send your comments and suggestions to <a href="mailto:info@keybr.com">info@keybr.com</a> | <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/keybr" target="forum">Public Forum</a></p><p class="FinePrint">Copyright © 2017 keybr.com | <a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> | <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> | <a href="/blog">Blog</a></p></footer></body></html>
