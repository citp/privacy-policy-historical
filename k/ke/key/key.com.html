<meta name="description" content=" <b>If you are comfortable with Key's handling of information we collect, you do not need to take any action at this time. Please read this policy and keep it for your records.</b>
<p>
This policy applies to all companies within the KeyCorp family of companies.  A list of those companies is included at the end of this policy.  If Key changes its information practices, we will provide you notice of any material changes. This Privacy Policy supersedes all previous notices or statements with respect to subject matters described in this policy. 
<p>
<b>The policy applies to you</b><br>
The descriptions in this Policy apply to our relationships with individual consumers who inquire about and/or obtain products or services from Key for personal, family and household purposes. 
<p>
While this Policy does not apply to business accounts, our commercial customers' information is also very important to us. We also respect the privacy of our commercial customers, and take steps necessary to protect their information. 
 <p>
<b>Strict security measures</b><br>
Key takes the security of information very seriously and has established security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to customer information. These standards exist for both our physical facilities and our online services. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard consumer information. 
<p>
<b>Limited employee access</b><br>
To protect you, Key has policies and procedures to limit employee access to information to only those employees with a business reason for accessing such information. Key educates its employees about the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy. We take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce employee responsibilities regarding customer information.
<p>
<b>Why Key collects information</b><br>
Key collects information about you to:
<ul>
<li>Accurately identify you;
<li>Protect and administer your records, accounts, and funds; 
<li>Help us design or improve our products and services; 
<li>Understand your financial needs;
<li>Save you time when you apply for new products and services;
<li>Offer you quality products and services; and
<li>Comply with certain laws and regulations.
</ul>
<p>
<b>We collect information from:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Applications and other forms that you provide to us (information such as your name, address, social security number, assets, income and investment objectives);
<li>The KeyCorp family of companies on transactions you've conducted (information such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transaction and debit card usage); 
<li>Nonaffiliated companies, external to Key, on transactions you've conducted (information such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transaction and credit card usage); 
<li>Outside sources that assist us in the origination of products and services like brokers, dealers, educational institutions (such as, application information and transaction information);
<li>Credit reporting agencies and demographic data companies (information such as your creditworthiness, credit history and demographic information); and
<li>Public sources such as federal, state or local records, (information such as mortgage and other lien information).
</ul>
<p>
Key has established procedures so that the financial information we collect is accurate, current and complete. Key is committed to work with you to promptly correct any inaccurate information.
<p>
<b>The selective sharing of information</b><br>
Depending on the type of relationship you have with Key, we may share information within the KeyCorp family of companies, as well as with unaffiliated third parties external to Key. Key reserves the right to share all information we collect as this policy describes. 
<p>
We also disclose information to complete transactions initiated by you, when you request or authorize the disclosure, or if the disclosure is required by law. At times it is necessary to disclose information to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of an agreement we have with you and to protect the rights, property, or safety of Key, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 
<p>
<b>Sharing within the KeyCorp family</b><br>
We share information about you within the KeyCorp family of companies in order to provide you complete financial solutions.  Under the law, Key is permitted to share identification information within the KeyCorp family of companies, as well as information related to the transactions and experiences we have with our customers.  Key engages in many businesses, for example, banking, mortgage lending, brokerage and investment services, trust administration, asset management and insurance.  Sharing information among these businesses increases your access to our products and services, allows us to match our products and services to your specific needs, and simplifies transaction flows. For instance, we have developed systems that automatically complete some application forms for new products with information we have previously obtained from you. This shortens the processing time for you. In most instances, without this type of sharing you would be required to provide identical information each and every time you seek out a Key product or service. 
<p>
<b>Sharing with carefully selected companies</b>
We disclose information to nonaffiliated third parties with respect to marketing our own products and services, as well as those products or services we offer jointly with other financial institutions.  These &quot;marketing partners&quot; include: 
<ul>
<li>Marketing service providers who market our products and services and products and services of other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements; and
<li>Other financial institutions with whom we have entered into an agreement to jointly market financial products or services.
</ul>
<p>
In addition, we share information with unaffiliated third parties so that they may offer you additional products and services we believe are beneficial to you.  These third parties include:  
<ul>
<li>Financial service providers, such as mortgage bankers-brokers, securities broker-dealers, indirect loan originators, correspondent lenders, transaction processors and insurance agent/companies;
<li>Non-financial companies, such as retailers;
<li>Others, such as non-profit organizations.
</ul>
<p>
We also disclose information to nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law.  For example, we provide information to outside companies to perform services on our behalf, such as loan servicing, data analytics, bill payment, account aggregation services, e-mail services, mail house services, printing and account statementing; to government entities to respond to subpoenas; and to credit reporting agencies.  
<p>
Whatever the reason for sharing information we require strict confidentiality by the receiving parties and limit the use of the information to the purpose for which it was disclosed.
<p>
<b>Former customers</b><br>
If you end your relationship with Key, we will adhere to the information policies and practices described in this policy, as well as your opt out election with regard to information we have collected on you.
<p>
<b>Protecting your information online</b><br>
If you request information through Key.com, use online tools and calculators, apply online for products, subscribe to online services, complete an online form, or conduct transactions online (e.g. internet or wireless device), Key and certain unaffiliated third parties with which we partner to deliver online products and services may retain the information you provide. To ensure your online banking and/or online application of products and services is secure, we use technology that encrypts, or scrambles information so it can transfer privately between you and Key's network. Additionally, your online banking information is securely linked to you through the use of a unique login I.D. and its associated password.
<p>
Account aggregation<br>
As a subscriber to this service, Key will collect and display your Key and non-Key account data for you.    Key may use the data captured through this service in aggregate form to help us better understand general consumer behavior.  The information is kept in aggregate form and cannot be used to identify you.  With your permission, Key may use your data to market select competitive products or services to you.
<p>
Online surveys<br>
This information is used solely for research purposes. You are not identified to any of this information; we use this information only in aggregate form to help us develop a superior web site.
<p>
E-mail<br>
If you agree to receive e-mail messages from Key, we will retain the information you provide us to deliver e-mails of specific interest to you. If you choose to send us e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail message, your e-mail address, and our subsequent response. Please be careful about the information you provide to us by e-mail; as with any public web site, this channel of communication is not necessarily secure against interception.
<p>


Cookies<br>
A 'cookie' allows Key to determine that a visit has occurred within our site, as well as which pages were viewed.   A cookie is NOT used to identify you and will not collect personal information. You remain anonymous throughout your visit. Cookies are commonly used on web sites and do not harm your PC. You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. 
<p>
Children online<br>
Protecting children's identities and information online is important. Key does not knowingly solicit data from children online, nor do we market our online products and services to children.
<p>
<b>Additional rights</b><br>
You may have other privacy protections under state laws and we will comply with applicable state laws with regard to our information practices. 
<p>

<center><h3>YOUR OPTIONS</h3></center>
If you prefer that Key not share information about you, you may restrict information sharing (other than those disclosures permitted by law). Such an election means you &quot;opt out&quot; of information sharing. <b>It is important to understand that an election to opt out of information sharing does not prohibit Key from contacting you about additional products or services. It only restricts the sharing of information with unaffiliated third parties and/or within the KeyCorp family of companies. </b> The types of information that may be shared and the categories of companies with which it may be shared are those discussed in this policy. The opt-out options only apply to individual consumers who have obtained or sought out products or services for personal, family or household purposes. 
<p>
If you choose to opt out, you have two separate options. 
<ol>
<li><b> External Sharing</b> - Unaffiliated Third Parties. You may elect to opt out of information sharing with unaffiliated third party companies that are not part of the KeyCorp family of companies.  Even if you opt out, we may still continue to share information with our marketing partners and with other nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law. 
<li> <b>Internal Sharing</b> - KeyCorp family of Companies. You also have the right to opt out of information sharing among the KeyCorp family of companies. Limiting the information Key may share within its corporate family may restrict our ability to provide you with the best and most comprehensive products and services. For example, this may affect our ability to offer you certain combined products and statements, or to offer you more competitive products that may be available to you based on your total Key relationship.  If you elect to opt out of information sharing among Key's affiliates, Key is still permitted by law to share identification information and information we have on our experiences or transactions with you within the KeyCorp family of companies. 
<p>
Your election to opt out will apply to all products and services you obtain within the KeyCorp family of companies for personal, family or household purposes, either singly or jointly with others. If you have a product or service jointly with another person(s), each of you may opt out individually or for each other. If you elect to opt out, information about other joint parties to your products and services may be disclosed unless their information has also been opted-out.
<p>
<b>For more information, or to opt out</b><br>
If you would like more information about your options, or wish to opt out of information sharing, please call <b>1-800-361-0968</b>.  If you have previously opted out of internal or external information sharing, please be assured that your election will remain effective.  You do not need to call unless you wish to change your election.
<p>
Your relationship with Key is a way for you to gain access to complete, customized financial solutions. We offer innovative products and personal attention. At the same time we work hard to protect the confidentiality and security of information. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with the financial products and services you need.

<!--Overview-->

Please read it to learn more about the ways we protect the information we collect, and to find out how you can limit the information about you that we share within the KeyCorp family of companies and with unaffiliated third parties external to Key.

	 <b>If you are comfortable with Key's handling of information we collect, you do not need to take any action at this time. Please read this policy and keep it for your records.</b>
</p><p>
This policy applies to all companies within the KeyCorp family of companies.  A list of those companies is included at the end of this policy.  If Key changes its information practices, we will provide you notice of any material changes. This Privacy Policy supersedes all previous notices or statements with respect to subject matters described in this policy. 
</p><p>
<b>The policy applies to you</b><br>
The descriptions in this Policy apply to our relationships with individual consumers who inquire about and/or obtain products or services from Key for personal, family and household purposes. 
</p><p>
While this Policy does not apply to business accounts, our commercial customers' information is also very important to us. We also respect the privacy of our commercial customers, and take steps necessary to protect their information. 
 </p><p>
<b>Strict security measures</b><br>
Key takes the security of information very seriously and has established security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to customer information. These standards exist for both our physical facilities and our online services. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard consumer information. 
</p><p>
<b>Limited employee access</b><br>
To protect you, Key has policies and procedures to limit employee access to information to only those employees with a business reason for accessing such information. Key educates its employees about the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy. We take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce employee responsibilities regarding customer information.
</p><p>
<b>Why Key collects information</b><br>
Key collects information about you to:
</p><ul>
<li>Accurately identify you;
</li><li>Protect and administer your records, accounts, and funds; 
</li><li>Help us design or improve our products and services; 
</li><li>Understand your financial needs;
</li><li>Save you time when you apply for new products and services;
</li><li>Offer you quality products and services; and
</li><li>Comply with certain laws and regulations.
</li></ul>
<p>
<b>We collect information from:</b><br>
</p><ul>
<li>Applications and other forms that you provide to us (information such as your name, address, social security number, assets, income and investment objectives);
</li><li>The KeyCorp family of companies on transactions you've conducted (information such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transaction and debit card usage); 
</li><li>Nonaffiliated companies, external to Key, on transactions you've conducted (information such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transaction and credit card usage); 
</li><li>Outside sources that assist us in the origination of products and services like brokers, dealers, educational institutions (such as, application information and transaction information);
</li><li>Credit reporting agencies and demographic data companies (information such as your creditworthiness, credit history and demographic information); and
</li><li>Public sources such as federal, state or local records, (information such as mortgage and other lien information).
</li></ul>
<p>
Key has established procedures so that the financial information we collect is accurate, current and complete. Key is committed to work with you to promptly correct any inaccurate information.
</p><p>
<b>The selective sharing of information</b><br>
Depending on the type of relationship you have with Key, we may share information within the KeyCorp family of companies, as well as with unaffiliated third parties external to Key. Key reserves the right to share all information we collect as this policy describes. 
</p><p>
We also disclose information to complete transactions initiated by you, when you request or authorize the disclosure, or if the disclosure is required by law. At times it is necessary to disclose information to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of an agreement we have with you and to protect the rights, property, or safety of Key, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 
</p><p>
<b>Sharing within the KeyCorp family</b><br>
We share information about you within the KeyCorp family of companies in order to provide you complete financial solutions.  Under the law, Key is permitted to share identification information within the KeyCorp family of companies, as well as information related to the transactions and experiences we have with our customers.  Key engages in many businesses, for example, banking, mortgage lending, brokerage and investment services, trust administration, asset management and insurance.  Sharing information among these businesses increases your access to our products and services, allows us to match our products and services to your specific needs, and simplifies transaction flows. For instance, we have developed systems that automatically complete some application forms for new products with information we have previously obtained from you. This shortens the processing time for you. In most instances, without this type of sharing you would be required to provide identical information each and every time you seek out a Key product or service. 
</p><p>
<b>Sharing with carefully selected companies</b>
We disclose information to nonaffiliated third parties with respect to marketing our own products and services, as well as those products or services we offer jointly with other financial institutions.  These "marketing partners" include: 
</p><ul>
<li>Marketing service providers who market our products and services and products and services of other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements; and
</li><li>Other financial institutions with whom we have entered into an agreement to jointly market financial products or services.
</li></ul>
<p>
In addition, we share information with unaffiliated third parties so that they may offer you additional products and services we believe are beneficial to you.  These third parties include:  
</p><ul>
<li>Financial service providers, such as mortgage bankers-brokers, securities broker-dealers, indirect loan originators, correspondent lenders, transaction processors and insurance agent/companies;
</li><li>Non-financial companies, such as retailers;
</li><li>Others, such as non-profit organizations.
</li></ul>
<p>
We also disclose information to nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law.  For example, we provide information to outside companies to perform services on our behalf, such as loan servicing, data analytics, bill payment, account aggregation services, e-mail services, mail house services, printing and account statementing; to government entities to respond to subpoenas; and to credit reporting agencies.  
</p><p>
Whatever the reason for sharing information we require strict confidentiality by the receiving parties and limit the use of the information to the purpose for which it was disclosed.
</p><p>
<b>Former customers</b><br>
If you end your relationship with Key, we will adhere to the information policies and practices described in this policy, as well as your opt out election with regard to information we have collected on you.
</p><p>
<b>Protecting your information online</b><br>
If you request information through Key.com, use online tools and calculators, apply online for products, subscribe to online services, complete an online form, or conduct transactions online (e.g. internet or wireless device), Key and certain unaffiliated third parties with which we partner to deliver online products and services may retain the information you provide. To ensure your online banking and/or online application of products and services is secure, we use technology that encrypts, or scrambles information so it can transfer privately between you and Key's network. Additionally, your online banking information is securely linked to you through the use of a unique login I.D. and its associated password.
</p><p>
Account aggregation<br>
As a subscriber to this service, Key will collect and display your Key and non-Key account data for you.    Key may use the data captured through this service in aggregate form to help us better understand general consumer behavior.  The information is kept in aggregate form and cannot be used to identify you.  With your permission, Key may use your data to market select competitive products or services to you.
</p><p>
Online surveys<br>
This information is used solely for research purposes. You are not identified to any of this information; we use this information only in aggregate form to help us develop a superior web site.
</p><p>
E-mail<br>
If you agree to receive e-mail messages from Key, we will retain the information you provide us to deliver e-mails of specific interest to you. If you choose to send us e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail message, your e-mail address, and our subsequent response. Please be careful about the information you provide to us by e-mail; as with any public web site, this channel of communication is not necessarily secure against interception.
</p><p>


Cookies<br>
A 'cookie' allows Key to determine that a visit has occurred within our site, as well as which pages were viewed.   A cookie is NOT used to identify you and will not collect personal information. You remain anonymous throughout your visit. Cookies are commonly used on web sites and do not harm your PC. You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. 
</p><p>
Children online<br>
Protecting children's identities and information online is important. Key does not knowingly solicit data from children online, nor do we market our online products and services to children.
</p><p>
<b>Additional rights</b><br>
You may have other privacy protections under state laws and we will comply with applicable state laws with regard to our information practices. 
</p><p>

</p><center><h3>YOUR OPTIONS</h3></center>
If you prefer that Key not share information about you, you may restrict information sharing (other than those disclosures permitted by law). Such an election means you "opt out" of information sharing. <b>It is important to understand that an election to opt out of information sharing does not prohibit Key from contacting you about additional products or services. It only restricts the sharing of information with unaffiliated third parties and/or within the KeyCorp family of companies. </b> The types of information that may be shared and the categories of companies with which it may be shared are those discussed in this policy. The opt-out options only apply to individual consumers who have obtained or sought out products or services for personal, family or household purposes. 
<p>
If you choose to opt out, you have two separate options. 
</p></font><ol><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1">
<li><b> External Sharing</b> - Unaffiliated Third Parties. You may elect to opt out of information sharing with unaffiliated third party companies that are not part of the KeyCorp family of companies.  Even if you opt out, we may still continue to share information with our marketing partners and with other nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law. 
</li></font><li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1"> <b>Internal Sharing</b> - KeyCorp family of Companies. You also have the right to opt out of information sharing among the KeyCorp family of companies. Limiting the information Key may share within its corporate family may restrict our ability to provide you with the best and most comprehensive products and services. For example, this may affect our ability to offer you certain combined products and statements, or to offer you more competitive products that may be available to you based on your total Key relationship.  If you elect to opt out of information sharing among Key's affiliates, Key is still permitted by law to share identification information and information we have on our experiences or transactions with you within the KeyCorp family of companies. 
<p>
Your election to opt out will apply to all products and services you obtain within the KeyCorp family of companies for personal, family or household purposes, either singly or jointly with others. If you have a product or service jointly with another person(s), each of you may opt out individually or for each other. If you elect to opt out, information about other joint parties to your products and services may be disclosed unless their information has also been opted-out.
</p><p>
<b>For more information, or to opt out</b><br>
If you would like more information about your options, or wish to opt out of information sharing, please call <b>1-800-361-0968</b>.  If you have previously opted out of internal or external information sharing, please be assured that your election will remain effective.  You do not need to call unless you wish to change your election.
</p><p>
Your relationship with Key is a way for you to gain access to complete, customized financial solutions. We offer innovative products and personal attention. At the same time we work hard to protect the confidentiality and security of information. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with the financial products and services you need.
