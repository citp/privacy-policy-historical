## Children

We recognize the particular importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child has provided our website with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian call 877.636.3673 and we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.

## Protection & Management of your Personal Information

**Encryption & Security:** Our web site uses Transport Layer Security (TSL) v1.2 to encrypt your personal information, including your credit card number, as it travels from your computer to our server and from our server to our payment processor. TSL v 1.2 technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Our payment system incorporates a ‘payment bridge’ which is a separate server from the actual KegWorks web site you see. Communication between our webserver, the payment bridge and our payment processor uses 256 bit encryption and your credit card number is not saved in our system.

Internally, KegWorks stores all data using industry standard security devices, such as firewalls and encryption protocols, to prevent against unauthorized access to our data. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. We have put in place policies to restrict access to your information by our employees.

Despite our efforts, no website, mobile application, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” You can help keep your data safe by taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse.

**Retention of your personal information:** We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this policy, unless otherwise required by law For example, we keep your account profile information for as long as you keep your KegWorks account, but, we may keep your order history longer to comply with legal obligations.

**Managing your personal information:** You may have the right to request: (i) access to your personal information; (ii) an electronic copy of your personal information (portability); (iii) correction of your personal information if it is incomplete or inaccurate; or (iii) deletion or restriction of your personal information in certain circumstances provided by applicable law. Where we have obtained your consent for the processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you have a request regarding your personal information that cannot be fulfilled from your account settings, please contact us. Contact details can be found in the “[Questions and Personal Information Requests](https://web.archive.org/questions)” section below.

Managing your notifications: You can opt-out of receiving KegWorks marketing communications by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions in the message or by contacting us. Contact details are in the “[Questions and Personal Information Requests](https://web.archive.org/questions)” section below.

Our security measures are designed to prevent anyone from stealing and using your credit card number. In addition, consumer protection laws protect you against the unauthorized use of your credit card. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, if your credit card is used without your authorization, your liability for those fraudulent charges cannot exceed $50. So, if someone steals your credit card or your credit card number, your liability is limited to $50 no matter how much the thief charges to your account. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

Applicable law and our practices change over time and our Policy is subject to change. If we decide to update our privacy policy, we will post the changes on our Site. If we materially change the way in which we process your personal information, we will provide you with prior notice, or where legally required, request your consent prior to implementing such changes.
