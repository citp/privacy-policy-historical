We Take Your Privacy Seriously

The following Privacy Policy outlines how we collect and use information about you. 

Please note, our Privacy Policy is subject to change, so we encourage you to visit this page frequently to review our practices. 

By using services provided by KegWorks and on KegWorks.com, you indicate that you agree to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy: 

Why We Collect Information  
First and foremost, KegWorks collects information to improve the product offerings and site features that we present to you via our site. We also use your information to measure our site's success and performance. Collecting information about what products you are interested in and what site features you use helps us to improve our site for you. For example, aggregate information gives us an idea of the number of visitors we attract, what products they are looking at and how they navigate around our site. Looking at this compiled information allows us to give you a better KegWorks! 

Personal Information We Collect  
Personal information that we collect is provided (to us, by you) on a strictly voluntary basis. We may receive personal information from you in a number of ways, depending on the service you are using and your choices while using our services. 

We may ask you for, and you may choose to send to us, your name, email address, physical address or other personal information necessary to complete a transaction or provide services to you. For example, we collect information you provide when you place an order, register with us, send us an email or call us, enter a sweepstakes, or enroll to receive our newsletters. This information may include:

  * Your name.
  * Your mailing address.
  * Your e–mail address.
  * Your phone number.
  * Your credit card number.



You, our customer, voluntarily provide all of this information. Wherever we ask you for personal information, we try to include a link to this Privacy Policy for your review. 

Use of Personal Information  
As noted above, unless you voluntarily provide personal information for a specific purpose, we do not collect personal information from you. If you choose to provide personal information, we use your personal information to provide you with particular services that you request. For instance, we may use your personal information to ship a product that you have ordered or to provide you with billing and status information regarding your order. 

KegWorks does not sell, trade or rent personal information to other companies. In certain instances, we may share your personal information with our consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make our site available, enhance its functionality or provide associated services. This may include those who process your orders, order your products, provide you with services or supply your sweepstake gifts and prizes. These third parties are not allowed to use personal information except for the purposes of providing the applicable services. In addition, we may provide information to law enforcement authorities or pursuant to a court order or to investigate suspected fraud. Our site and services are maintained in the United States of America. By using the site and/or services, you authorize the export of personal information to the USA and its storage and use as specified in this policy. 

Aggregate Information We Collect and Use  
In addition to personal information, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as site pages viewed, browser type, computer information, cookies, clickstream data and other information. Such aggregate information is anonymous and does not identify any individual user. 

"Cookies" are small data files that are sent to your browser and are stored on your hard drive, keeping track of your general activity on the Web. When you make subsequent visits to our site your cookie gives us a summary of your preferences and past experiences on the site. This allows us to tailor our product offerings more distinctly to your interests. 

"Clickstream data" is a trail of electronic information that is left at each Web site you visit. This information can be collected and stored by a site's server. We may, for example, use clickstream data to tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the site from which you linked to our site, how much time you spend on each page of our site, how you navigate throughout the site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the your needs.

Our website may offer links to other sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site. In addition, you may have linked to our website through another site. For example, in certain cases you may have linked to KegWorks.com through banner advertising, links on another site, or through a search engine. In such cases the site you linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information.

We recognize the particular importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

We have appropriate physical, electronic and procedural security safeguards to protect and secure the information we collect. 

Secure Sockets Layering (SSL)  
Our Web site uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, placing an order online at our website is just as safe as giving your credit card number over the phone. 

Internally, KegWorks stores all data using industry standard security devices, such as firewalls and encryption protocols, to prevent against unauthorized access to our data. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. We have put in place policies to restrict access to your information by our employees. 

Safe Shopping Guarantee  
Our security measures are designed to prevent anyone from stealing and using your credit card number. In addition, consumer protection laws protect you against the unauthorized use of your credit card. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, if your credit card is used without your authorization, your liability for those fraudulent charges cannot exceed $50. So, if someone steals your credit card or your credit card number, your liability is limited to $50 no matter how much the thief charges to your account.
