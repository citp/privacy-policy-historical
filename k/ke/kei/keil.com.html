When you submit sensitive information via the website, that information is protected both online and off-line.</p><p>All forms on this web site are available in secure format (SSL) only. Secure forms encrypt and protect information with the best encryption software in the industry — SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon displays in Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator, FireFox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer. To learn more about our SSL certificate, refer to <a href="/company/cert_ssl.asp">http://www.keil.com/company/cert_ssl.asp</a>.</p><p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our accounts receivable clerk or technical support personnel) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All database access is password-protected. Our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure, locked environment.</p><p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:security@keil.com">security@keil.com</a>.</p><h3><a name="Cookies" id="Cookies"></a>Cookies</h3><p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.
