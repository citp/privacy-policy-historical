We maintain a customer database and from time-to-time send mail through the postal service to customers listed in this database. If you wish to be excluded from our mailings, please contact our [customer service department](https://www.keil.com/product/custserv.asp).

#### E-mail Addresses

E-mail addresses are **NEVER** used for SPAM or unsolicited e-mail messages. E-mail addresses **ARE** used to help us cross-reference your database information.

Some forms ask if you would like to receive an e-mail message when a new software update is posted to the web site. If you do not wish to receive e-mail notifications of these updates, make sure that you un-check that control in the form.

### With Whom is the Information Shared?

 **Keil, An ARM Company,** will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

We may occasionally share aggregated **demographic** information with our tool partners. This information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use outside shipping companies (like FedEx, UPS, Airborne, USPS, and courier services) to ship orders. Therefore, we must provide your name, mailing address, and phone number to them. If you do not wish us to share this information, you may pick up your product from our offices.

We accept credit card orders and, on occasion, must provide the customer name and address information to VISA, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover for verification purposes. If you do not wish us to verify your credit card, you may use an alternate form of payment.

We partner with other embedded tools companies and chip manufacturers to provide you with important or interesting information about products or services that you may find beneficial. On occasion, we provide names and other contact information that are necessary for these companies to provide such information via a one-time mailing. Information transferred is used for only one mailing. To prevent the sharing of your information with these companies, refer to the section on opting-out.

### What Security Precautions are in Effect?

 **Keil, An ARM Company,** takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, that information is protected both online and off-line.

All forms on this web site are available in secure format (SSL) only. Secure forms encrypt and protect information with the best encryption software in the industry — SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon displays in Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator, FireFox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer. To learn more about our SSL certificate, refer to [http://www.keil.com/company/cert_ssl.asp](https://web.archive.org/company/cert_ssl.asp).

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our accounts receivable clerk or technical support personnel) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All database access is password-protected. Our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure, locked environment.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [security@keil.com](mailto:security@keil.com).
