_*Our affiliates include Keurig Canada Inc., Keurig UK Limited, Keurig Asia Pacific Pty Limited, Keurig Korea Ltd., Brewing a Better World Foundation, Keurig Singapore Pte Ltd., Green Mountain Hong Kong Limited and other companies that may be added from time to time and that are controlled by or under common control with one of the companies listed here._

Information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify you as an individual is not considered personal information. We refer to this type of information as ‘non-personal information’, such as a favorite or bookmarked site, your language setting in your browser, or what you site you came from when visiting our sites.

**Information You Provide:** You give us information when you use our sites to do things like place an order, or participate in a promotion, or contest.

We share aggregated information about you and your use of our sites with other companies for industry benchmarking, consumer analysis, market research and analytics. This information does not identify you personally.

**_When Required by Law or to Protect Our Company_**

There may be times when we have to disclose your information in order to comply with applicable law or government requests, to assist in fraud protection and investigations, to enforce the terms of any of our notices or if we think it is appropriate and necessary in order to protect the rights, property, or safety of our employees and customers.

**_Purchase or Sale of Businesses_**

  * **Cookies and Other Similar Technologies**

_We use various internet technologies, alone or in combination, to collect and share information about you and your use of our sites for many reasons, such as administering and facilitating your access to and use of our sites, understanding your behavior on our sites and analyzing usage behavior and target advertising to you._

_In addition we, may share the information we collect from these technologies, such as demographic data, IP address, aggregate usage statistics for our sites, with advertisers and other third parties._

We use various internet technologies to:

   • collect and share information about you and your use of our sites    • distinguish you from other users of our sites    • administering and facilitating your access to and use of our sites    • understanding your behavior on our sites and analyzing usage behavior    • measuring the effectiveness of advertisements    • target advertising to you

In addition, we may share the information we collect from these technologies, such as demographic data, IP address, aggregate usage statistics for our sites, with advertisers and other third parties.

Some cookies (or other similar technologies as described below) are set by us when you visit our sites and others may be set by third parties both on our sites and on third party sites. This is because we have contracted with that third party to provide these services to you on our behalf (such as analytics) or because the non-Keurig sites you are visiting contain content or ads from third parties delivered by ad networks. When your browser connects to those third party links (and therefore third party cookies), they may be collecting information about you and your online activities that is not governed by this privacy policy. See our section on Links to Third Party Sites for more information.

**_Cookies_**   
TA cookie is a small browser specific file of letters and numbers that is sent to your browser and stored on the hard drive of your computer (or internet enabled device) when you visit our sites. We use the following cookies on our website:

**Strictly necessary cookies** \- These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around our sites and use its features, such as remembering what products you placed in your cart. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided. 

**Analytical or Performance cookies** \- These cookies collect information in an anonymous form about how our site is used. They allow us to do such things as recognize recent activity and content consumed, count the number of visitors to our sites and see how our sites are navigated. 

**Functionality cookies** \- These are used to recognize you when you return to our sites. This enables us to do such things as personalize our content for you and remember your preferences and settings. 

We use cookies for many reasons, including:

•   **Analytics** to help us manage and operate our sites and improve their functioning by analyzing how users interact with our sites. •   **Remembering** you so we can personalize your experience on our sites, including storing your preferences and settings, such as what language your browser is set to our sites or from what country your computer is visiting our sites. •   **Targeted advertising** to do things like promote products and services that we believe may be of interest to you and ensuring that you don’t see the same advertisement repeatedly. Because we have advertisements on our own sites as well as sites of third parties, we are able to gather information over time about the types of pages, content and ads that you, or others who are using your computer, have visited or viewed. We do this to help us select and display targeted advertisements and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. •   **Account Sign-In** so you can move around our sites without having to re-enter your account information. •   **Combining** information about you that we collect from cookies (and other similar technologies) with your consumer profile.

**_How to Manage Cookies:_**   
_Browser Settings_ : You may choose to refuse cookies by changing your browser’s settings. However, our sites need certain cookies to perform certain functions, including the online purchase of products. As a result, not all parts of our sites will function properly if you turn off cookies in your browser.

_Opt Out Controls for Advertising:_ We understand that not everyone wants to receive behaviorally targeted advertising. Here are a few sites you can visit to learn how to opt out from receiving this kind of advertising: (Note that opting out does not mean you will stop seeing ads, it just means those ads won’t be behaviorally targeted and while we will still collect information about you, we cannot use that information for the purpose of behaviorally targeted advertising.)

**_Other Similar Technologies_**   
•  Web Beacons: Web beacons, also known as clear GIFs or pixel tags, are transparent image files embedded in our sites, advertisements, or emails and are used to deliver cookies. Web beacons collect generic information about your navigation through a single site or a series of sites to help us compile statistics about the effectiveness of our sites and promotional campaigns. They can also let us know things such as whether or not you opened or acted upon an email or newsletter or other advertisement we sent you.

•  Local Shared Objects: Local shared objects, also known as “Flash cookies,” are data files placed on your computer when you visit a site. Local shared objects are similar to cookies and track your online activity.

  * **Online Tracking**

_Our sites do not currently respond to a Do Not Track setting in your browser. This means that we will continue to collect, use and share information about you as described in this Privacy Policy even though you have turned on a Do Not Track feature._

Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature. When you turn this feature on, it sends a signal or a preference to the sites you visit indicating that you do not want to be tracked. There is not yet a uniform understanding of how to interpret this signal so our sites do not currently respond to a Do Not Track setting in your browser. This means that we will continue to collect, use and share information about you as described in this Privacy Policy even though you have turned on a Do Not Track feature.

  * **Links to Third Party Sites**

_The privacy policies of other companies may differ from ours. We are not responsible for their information collection practices and you should review their privacy notices._

The privacy policies of other companies may differ from ours and you should review their privacy notices.

_We use a variety of physical, electronic and managerial procedures and technologies to help protect and safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure._

We use a variety of physical, electronic and managerial procedures and technologies to help protect and safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

When you make a purchase through our sites, you provide payment information, such as your credit card number (or Pay Pal information), your name, billing address, shipping address and the security code associated with your credit card. Our third party payment processor collects this information for us and uses it only to complete your transaction, or store your payment information if you choose to enable that function. Our payment processor shares this payment information with associated banks and other entities to process payments, as well as for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction.

  * **Storing and Processing Your Information**

_Your information may be collected, accessed, processed and stored in the United States as well as in any other country where we, our affiliates, or our Third Party Partners maintain facilities._
