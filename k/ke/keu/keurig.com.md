# Privacy Policy - Keurig.com

We at Keurig, Incorporated take your privacy concerns very seriously. 

**What We Collect**

When you purchase a product from Keurig.com, we ask you to provide information to fulfill your order. We do not require you to create an account to place an order. You may place an order as a Guest. You will need to provide your name, email address, phone, shipping address, and billing address in order to process and deliver an order. If you do create an account with us, we also require you to create a username and password. Signing up for emails or registering a brewer also requires you to supply certain information so we may execute your request. 

**What We Do With What We Collect  
**   
From time to time, Keurig contacts customers by email, phone or mail to inform them of new products, services and special offers, or to follow up on previous interactions. Additionally, because Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. is Keurig’s parent company, we also give you the opportunity to receive information from them. 

When you create an account, you are given the opportunity to receive communications from us and/or Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. You may choose to opt-out of these communications during the set up process or after set up at any time by signing in to "My Account" and visiting the “Communication Options” page within the "My Profile" section or by calling customer service at 1-866-901-BREW (2739). You may also opt out of Keurig communication by simply using the “Unsubscribe” link located in the footer of our emails. Please note: changes can take up to 10 business days to take effect. 

Maintaining the confidentiality of your personal information - including credit card data - is very important to Keurig. As a Keurig customer, your personal information will never be rented or sold. For your security, we only store your credit card information if you choose to set up an automatic delivery. In that case, it is stored on a secure computer in a format that makes it unusable except by us, for your order. If you do not set up an automatic delivery, you will have to enter your credit card information each time you order. We understand that this may be a little inconvenient for you, but some customers appreciate the added peace of mind this brings. 

**Cookies**

Like most commercial websites, [www.keurig.com](http://www.keurig.com/) uses cookies to improve the shopping experience. A cookie is a small text file that is transferred from our server to your computer's hard drive through your web browser that enables our system to recognize your browser. Cookies help us understand if you are a new or returning visitor. This information lets us know how we are doing at both attracting new visitors and maintaining relationships with our existing customers. 

**Secure Online Ordering  
**  
Keurig is committed to ensuring that your shopping experience on [www.keurig.com](http://www.keurig.com/) is safe and secure. 

We store all of the personal information you provide us when you create an account. If you place an order as a Guest, we store only the information we require to fulfill your order, and then we dispose of your information. 

When you do place an order, your address and credit card information is transmitted using industry standard encryption technology called secure socket layers (SSL) which ensures that it is encrypted during transmission. The integrity of our safe shopping technology is verified by Verisign, the premier secure transaction accreditation authority. You will see the Verisign logo during the checkout process to confirm that you are in 'secure mode.' Additional security assurances are given by the locked padlock icon or solid key icon at the bottom of your browser window, and the letters "https" (rather than "http") located in the URL address window at the top of your browser. 

If you prefer, you may place your order by calling 1-866-901-BREW (2739) and a customer service representative will be happy to help you. 

**Privacy Policy Changes  
**  
Our business is evolving and with it our Privacy Policy may change. For customers who have agreed to accept Keurig emails, it is our policy to e-mail notices of our privacy policy changes. We invite all visitors to check this policy on [www.keurig.com](http://www.keurig.com/) from time to time. We will post all changes to this Privacy Policy on our website.
