Protection of our customers' privacy is paramount to Keurig.

##### Personal Information Stored by Keurig

The only personal information we store is information that you give us voluntarily. Some information, such as name and address information, is required in order for us to deliver your order.

##### Credit Card Information

For your security, we only store your credit card information if you choose to set up an automatic monthly delivery. In that case, it is stored on a secure computer in a format that makes it unusable except by us, for your order.

If you do not set up an automatic monthly delivery, you will have to enter your credit card information each time you order. We understand that this may be a little inconvenient for you, but some customers appreciate the added peace of mind this brings.

When you do place an order, your address and credit card information is transmitted using industry standard encryption technology called secure socket layers (SSL) which ensures that it is encrypted during transmission. The integrity of our safe shopping technology is verified by Verisign.

You can learn more about our secure shopping policy [here](https://www.keurig.com/safeShopping.asp?mscsid=R713BPT0U2AH9KD6RU4C0A5V0TA7AP7C).

##### Cookies

Like most commercial websites, [www.keurig.com](https://web.archive.org/) uses cookies to improve the shopping experience, and to help us understand how often visitors return to our website. No personal information of any kind is stored in a cookie.

##### Changing My Personal Information

You may edit your personal information at any time by going to My Account. There, you can change your shipping address(es), password, and profile and preferences information.

##### Communication With Customers

From time to time, Keurig contacts customers by email or phone to inform them of new products, services and special offers, or to follow up on previous interactions. However, you may opt not to receive any further communications from us at any time via 'Edit My Account Information' or calling customer service at 1-866-901-BREW (2739).
