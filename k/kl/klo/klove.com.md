# Privacy Policy - Positive & Encouraging K-LOVE

## Information We Collect and Receive

K-LOVE collects and retains information about you and your device when you visit or give us information through the K-LOVE website.

## Non-Personally Identifiable Information

When your computer or mobile device contacts our web servers, we collect usage information about how our visitors use and navigate the K-LOVE website. An anonymous profile is established based on your visit and information such as the frequency and length of your visit, browser type, referrer data identifying the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting the web site, and your IP address. No personally identifiable information is collected without your voluntarily providing it to us.

## Personally Identifiable Information

We collect personal information from you, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Once you voluntarily provide K-LOVE with personal information through our website, any previous anonymous profile associated with your IP address is updated with your personal information, including email address, and your email becomes the primary identifier for your profile.

## How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used to improve your K-LOVE experience. Visitors are provided services tailored especially for them, or to inform them about new features or services. Occasionally, K-LOVE conducts user surveys to better target the music we play.

While K-LOVE uses third party vendors to communicate with you, your information, including your email address, will not be sold, shared or disclosed with any third party outside of the K-LOVE family unless otherwise noted in a specific consent or other entry, or as necessary to provide communications from K-LOVE through third party vendors. K-LOVE employs strict security measures to safeguard online transactions, and personal information is stored in a secured database and always sent via an encrypted channel.
