##  **1\. Scope and application**

This Privacy Notice describes how Khoros collects, uses, shares, and secures the Personal Data about individuals who use this web site ([khoros.com](http://khoros.com/)) and our services.

When we say “Personal Data,” we mean any data that could directly or indirectly be used to identify you or your household, ranging from (for example) your name and email address to the IP address of your device and the location from which you access this website. 

This Privacy Notice describes how we collect, use, share, and secure the Personal Data that we collect when you access this website and our services. 

This Privacy Notice also describes how we handle Personal Data on behalf of our customers. 

It is important to understand, however, that when we handle your Personal Data on behalf of one of our customers, we are doing so pursuant to the customer’s instructions as their data processor. If you want to know more details about that customer’s data protection policies, you should consult the customer’s privacy notice.

This Privacy Notice describes how Khoros:

This Privacy Notice also describes your rights regarding the use of your Personal Data by Khoros, as well as the options available to you regarding how we communicate with you.

## 3\. How do we use your Personal Data?

  * To maintain and improve this website and our services
  * To provide personalized services, including behaviorally targeted ads
  * To measure the performance of this website and our services
  * To communicate with you
  * To protect Khoros, you, our customers, and the public



To read more about how we use your Personal Data, click here.

We collect and process your Personal Data for the following purposes:

  *  **To help us provide, maintain, and improve the Site and the Services, and to assess and enhance user experience on the Site and Services.** We conduct this processing on the basis of our legitimate interest in ensuring the optimal functionality of our Site and Services. 



Information collected by Khoros from each Customer Community is used solely to provide the Services for that Community, to provide related Services to the customer who manages that Community, and as otherwise agreed in a contract between Khoros and the customer. Other information gathered is solely used to: (i) respond to a user's request for additional information on Khoros Services; (ii) provide, develop, enhance and support related Khoros Services; (iii) fulfill Khoros’s legal obligations and defend Khoros’s legal rights, as needed. We may also use a user's email address to send promotional or marketing materials on related Services, such as updates on the product line, but this is only after the user is a customer, a Service is requested by the user, or Khoros has some other pre-existing business relationship with the user. We use your IP address and browser-type information in the general administration of our website 

In addition, we use the information that we gather from other social media sites to:

  1. provide context to a brand, such as information about an individual’s past interactions with that brand, and the individual’s public profile information, to improve the quality of the brand’s interactions with that consumer who is reaching out to them over social media,
  2. assess each individual’s general topics of interest (but excluding sensitive topics such as political or religious views),
  3. measure their influence on social media by assigning a numerical value based on our proprietary algorithm which looks at frequency/ dates of activity, responses of other individuals to that activity, and the occurrence of certain key words and/or brand names, and,
  4. allow brands to compare themselves to other brands in their industry by seeing aggregated statistics of the numbers of individuals who promote or detract from each brand based on the individuals’ public social media activity.



Through our social media management services, we provide this information on individuals to the customer support and service representatives of the companies who are Khoros customers, the “brands”, so that those representatives can provide support and service to their consumer customers more effectively, by triaging communications to address more urgent requests in priority order, and by understanding the interests of their consumer customers to provide more targeted support. We also provide aggregated statistic to the brands for competitive analysis purposes.

Through our Khoros Community and Khoros JX Community platforms, we make social impact scores available for individuals who participate in the community to create more effective and interesting social interactions within the Community.

In the collection and use of information from other social media sites, we rely on our legitimate interests in providing services to our customers, and assisting them to provide better service to their customers, under applicable data privacy regulations, and balance those interests with the data privacy concerns of individuals. If you would like more information about our legitimate interests analysis, or have concerns that you would like us to address, please contact [privacy@khoros.com](mailto:privacy@khoros.com).

  *  **In accordance with your consent.**



In regard to Khoros Services, Khoros collects information under the direction of its Customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our Services, please contact the Customer that you interact with directly. We may transfer Personal Data to companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers.

Please note that Khoros may use and disclose data cleansed of all Personal Data so that it no longer can identify the Customer and/or user; and aggregated with similar data from other Khoros Customers (“Aggregated Data”) to determine and report Services usage patterns by Customers and users generally, and for any other legitimate purpose.

Information collected by Khoros from Customers is used solely to provide the Services and as otherwise agreed to in a contract between Khoros and the Customer.

Sometimes, our Customers have specific purposes for which they plan to use an individual user’s Personal Data, and our Customers describe those purposes at the point of collection. For example, a Customer may solicit a user’s feedback in order to improve services and products, respond to a user’s questions or comments, register in connection with a contest, giveaway, or drawing, respond to a request for a brochure, or to otherwise send information to the user. We may be asked to fulfill or assist with the fulfillment of the requirements associated with the point of collection purposes, but the responsibility to obtain any necessary consents remains with our Customers as the data controllers.
