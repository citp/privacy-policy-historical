# Privacy Policy | Kleenex® Brand

This website is owned and operated by Kimberly-Clark Corporation. At Kimberly-Clark, we recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about the information they provide to us and how we treat that information. Our Privacy Notice addresses those concerns. We may update the Notice from time to time, so please check in occasionally. There are extra regulatory requirements regarding online privacy protection for children age 12 and under. Please see the information under "Children" below. This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Kleenex.com Terms. Your use of Kimberly-Clark sites and any other personal information you provide on Kimberly-Clark sites remain subject to the terms of the Privacy Notice and Kleenex.com User Agreement.

### Our Policy on Privacy

At our site, we do not collect personally identifiable information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. You can visit our sites without telling us who you are or revealing information about yourself. However, if you specifically agree to provide us with identifiable information, such as by asking to be put on our mailing list, we may contact you from time to time. Please also note that any video, image or content posted at your direction onto Kimberly-Clark sites becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Notice.

There are some features of our site that require you to sign up to use. And if you do sign up, we use the information you supply for the purpose of providing the products, product information or services you request. Because of the volume of requests we receive, however, we may have to give your name, e-mail and postal addresses to a fulfillment house or distributor of our products who partner with us. On our behalf our partners will provide you with the information or products in which you expressed an interest.

Our site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we are conducting, and we may permit you to send your entry electronically in some cases. If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (i.e., to contact you if you're a winner).

### Children

Children's privacy is of primary concern to us, and our Policy and practices reflect applicable laws and regulations on children's privacy. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children age 12 and under. Any communication we get that is identified as being from a child of 12 and under will not be kept by Kimberly-Clark.

### Security

Kimberly-Clark takes precautions to protect your personal information. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, is collected on a web page enhanced with secure sockets layer protocol to protect the confidentiality of the data. No transmission of data over the internet or other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. We make reasonable efforts to secure your personal information once we receive it, but we cannot guarantee the security of information you send to us.

### Cookies

Like many companies, we sometimes use "cookie" technology on our website. These cookies are stored on your computer by your browser. When you log in, this type of cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor. The cookie doesn't obtain any personal information about you or provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer. We do use the cookie to help us identify site features in which you have the greatest interest so that we can provide more of what you may want.

We use the services of NetIQ/WebTrends to track the paths our customers take through our site. In doing so, we are better able to see where our customers go within our site and ensure our site is easy to navigate. If you have any questions concerning NetIQ/WebTrends, then you should refer to the NetIQ/WebTrends Reporting Service Privacy Policy to learn how they collect and use information, particularly the section of the Policy on Privacy Statement for Visitors to Sites Tracked by WebTrends on Demand.

GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
