**Online advice platform “CultiVent KWS Farm Service”**

CultiVent is a comprehensive information service for crop-specific and overarching content about our products, especially for corn, sugar beets, wheat, barley, rye, and rapeseed. Here you can find helpful tools (e.g. a search tool for patterns of damage in leaf diseases, planting planners, TS monitoring for silage corn) and calculators (e.g. how much seed is needed, stocking density). CultiVent offers you regional information customized to your growing region, e.g. for crop management of grain, nematode management in beet cultivation, and ground temperatures and heat levels for corn.

Registration is required for access to this service and the information.

**Collection, processing, and use of personal data:**

Personal data will only be collected if you share such data with us voluntarily, for instance when registering for personalized services such as CultiVent or to enable us to process your inquiries or a contract. The personal data collected will be processed and used primarily for providing the service and fulfilling your requests. It is important to us that only the data that are absolutely necessary (first and last name, postal code, address, e-mail address) are collected. Data that are labeled “optional” or not marked as required fields in the registration are not necessary for the core functionality of the personalized services, but can limit the range of services.

Furthermore, we use and process your information to tell you, using the communication methods you submitted (mail, fax, e-mail, phone) about our products, services, and special offers that could be of significant interest to you, and for carrying out customer surveys. To the extent required by law, your data will not be used for promotional purposes unless you have given us your consent in this regard.

**Disclosure of personal data:**

For the operation of our website and for the provision of personalized services, KWS also employs subsidiaries from the KWS group or external service providers who support us in processing orders, operating the website, providing personalized services and providing information to customers. These companies may only use your personal data in fulfilling their tasks on our behalf and are obligated to comply with the relevant data protection regulations. Under the circumstances outlined above, data processing may take place in EU countries or countries outside the EU.

To the extent legally permissible or to the extent that you have given your consent beforehand, we also disclose your data to other companies of the KWS Group to be used for promotional purposes. Your data will not be disclosed to third parties outside of the KWS Group for promotional purposes.

Transmission of personal data to state institutions and authorities takes place only in accordance with binding national legal provisions or if legal or criminal proceedings require them to be passed on. They will not be passed on for any other purposes.

Our websites use the following kinds of cookies. Their scope and how they work is explained as follows:

These objects save the necessary data independently of the browser you use and have no automatic expiration date. If you do not wish to have flash cookies processed, you must install an add-on for that purpose, e.g. “Better Privacy” for Mozilla Firefox (<https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/>) or the Adobe-Flash-Killer-Cookie for Google Chrome. You can prevent the use of HTML5 storage objects by putting your browser in private mode.
