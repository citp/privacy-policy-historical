                                                 PRIVACY POLICY
                                Sunflower Broadcasting PRIVACY POLICY
Sunflower Broadcasting strives to offer visitors to its website (www.KWCH.com) the many advantages of
Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. In order to do so, we may obtain
certain personal information from you. The purpose of this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is to inform you
about the types of information we gather about you when you visit www.KWCH.com, how we may use that
information, and the choices you have regarding our use of that information. This Privacy Policy supplements
and is incorporated as a part of Sunflower Broadcasting’s Terms of Use. Throughout this Privacy Policy,
“we” or “our” refers to Sunflower Broadcasting, and “you” or “your” refers to the person or entity who
accesses or uses this www.KWCH.com or its content (the “User”). This Privacy Policy applies solely to
information collected at www.KWCH.com.
                       COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION FROM USERS
We collect information on our Users in various ways, including by your voluntary submissions, through
surveys, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions and through “cookie” (as explained below) and other
tracking technology. The information we collect is used in a variety of ways including, but not limited to:
fulfilling and providing services requested by you; improving www.KWCH.com and our services; notifying
you about updates to www.KWCH.com and our services; and/or informing about products, services and
promotions in which you may have interest. With your authorization or as otherwise permitted under this
Privacy Policy, we may also share the information you provide with third parties.
                                      Personally Identifiable Information
Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your
name, phone number, e-mail, postal address or credit card information, and possibly information relating to
certain support or customer service issues (“Personally Identifiable Information”). You generally do not need
to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information to use this www.KWCH.com or to obtain information
from most of the features on www.KWCH.com.
In some cases, however, you may be asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information in order to access
certain pages of this www.KWCH.com, to use or subscribe to certain online services on this www.KWCH.com
or other products or to allow us to provide you with certain personalized or enhanced services that you have
requested. How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which
you elect to participate and the services provided. As noted, you can visit many pages on our
www.KWCH.com without providing any Personally Identifiable Information. Other pages may prompt you to
provide Personally Identifiable Information.
If you do not want to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information, you can always decide not
             to use such services or access such pages on www.KWCH.com. The choice is yours.
Please remember that if you post any Personally Identifiable Information in public areas of www.KWCH.com,
such as on bulletin boards or chat rooms, such information may be collected and used by other Users over
whom Sunflower Broadcasting has no control. Sunflower Broadcasting is not responsible for the use made by
third parties of any information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of www.KWCH.com.
                                             Aggregate Information
From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of
www.KWCH.com, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on www.KWCH.com, how long they stay
on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they click on. This information represents a generic overview of our
Users’ collective viewing habits and allows us and other third parties to modify information, promotions, Page

offers and/or discounts on products and services based on user traffic and behavior. We collect this information
through the use of technologies such as “cookies”, which are discussed in greater detail in this Privacy Policy.
We collect this information in order to determine which areas of www.KWCH.com are most popular and to
enhance www.KWCH.com for visitors. We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in
order to describe the use of www.KWCH.com to our existing or potential business partners or other third
parties, or in response to a government request. From time to time, we may use this information to optimize
third-party offers of products and/or services. We also may share aggregated demographic and preference data
with third parties to enable the provision of targeted information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on
products and services. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify
you or any other visitors of www.KWCH.com.
                                   Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Like most websites, this www.KWCH.com also may collect information automatically and through the use of
electronic tools that may be transparent to Users. For example, Sunflower Broadcasting may automatically
collect non-personally identifiable information and data through the use of “cookies”. Cookies are small text
files a website uses to recognize repeat Users, facilitate the User’s ongoing access to the website and facilitate
the use of the website. Cookies also allow a website to track usage behavior and compile site usage
information that will allow for the improvement of content and target advertising. Most browsers allow you to
control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set your browsers
to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. However, please
be aware that some features of our www.KWCH.com may not function or may be slower if you refuse cookies.
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other third parties with links on www.KWCH.com
as described below. We do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third party ad
servers is standard in the Internet industry.
Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP)
addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our
www.KWCH.com is accessed. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer
whenever you are surfing the web. Web servers, the computers that “serve up” webpages, automatically
identify your computer by its IP address. We may link the information we record using tracking technologies
to Personally Identifiable Information we collect at www.KWCH.com for our own and our marketing partners’
marketing and advertising purposes. In addition, we reserve the right to use IP addresses and other tracking
technologies to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use, to
protect our www.KWCH.com, our customers or others, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires
it.
www.KWCH.com may also use technology called “tracer tags”. These may also be referred to as “Clear GIFs”
or “Web Beacons”. This technology allows us to understand which pages you visit on www.KWCH.com.
These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our www.KWCH.com for you and other Users of our
www.KWCH.com.
We also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our www.KWCH.com. These
companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about
your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to
you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this
information used by these companies, click here:

                          DISCLOSURES AND TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION
We do not disclose Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, except when one or more of the
following conditions is true:Page 3


1. You have authorized us to provide such information, including, but not limited to, “opting-in” to a particular
service, program or promotion;
2. The disclosure is permitted by relevant law;
3. The disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or other disposition of all or part of our business or assets;
4. The Personally Identifiable Information to be disclosed is publicly available;
5. The party to whom the disclosure is made controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
Sunflower Broadcasting;
6. The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or maintenance of legal claims; or
7. The disclosure is to persons or entities for whom we are providing services, provided the disclosure is
consistent with the purpose for which the personal information was obtained.
                                              As a Service to Others
We may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for their marketing and/or advertising
purposes, but only if you have authorized us to do so by “opting-in” to a particular marketing or advertising
service, program or promotion. Users of our www.KWCH.com are given the opportunity to affirmatively
consent (opt in) to the disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to a third party or to the use of such
information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently
authorized by the User. We do this to ensure that our Users can make an informed choice as to whether or not
they want to share their information with such outside parties. We will provide individuals with a reasonable
mechanism to exercise their choices.
If you have at some point authorized us to share such information about you with others and later properly
notify us that you no longer want us to share your information (as discussed below), we will cease sharing your
information. However, except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not control the third parties
with whom we share such information and you will need to further notify such third parties if you would like
them to cease use of your information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to send you certain non-promotional communications to
fulfill pending or ongoing services requested by you, relating to www.KWCH.com (such as service
announcements), e-mail related to purchases you have made or information you have submitted, or similar
administrative or transactional messages.
                                              Our Service Providers
We may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain services for us, such as hosting or maintaining our
www.KWCH.com, storing your information, processing orders or subscriptions, or providing marketing
assistance and data analysis. We may provide Personally Identifiable Information to service providers when
that information is necessary for them to complete a requested transaction or otherwise perform their duties.
Sunflower Broadcasting will take reasonable steps to ensure that these service providers are notified of their
obligations to reasonably protect Personally Identifiable Information on Sunflower Broadcasting’s behalf.
                                                Business Transfers
As we continue to develop our business, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell some or all of our
business assets. Personally Identifiable Information and other customer information is generally one of the
Page 4


business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that Sunflower Broadcasting or all of its assets
are acquired, such information may be one of the transferred assets.
                                 Protection of Sunflower Broadcasting and Others
Sunflower Broadcasting fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our
services for illegal activities, and may in its sole discretion disclose Personally Identifiable Information or
other information to satisfy any law, regulation, subpoena, or government request or in connection with
litigation. Sunflower Broadcasting reserves the right to release Personally Identifiable Information or other
information about Users who we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise in violation of our
Terms of Use, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order, if we believe in our sole discretion that such
disclosure is necessary or appropriate to comply with any laws, to operate www.KWCH.com, or to protect the
rights or property of Sunflower Broadcasting, its affiliates, or any of their officers, directors, or employees,
agents, third party content providers, suppliers, sponsors, or licensors. Sunflower Broadcasting also reserves
the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities we reasonably believe in our sole discretion to be
unlawful.
                                      DATA SECURITY AND INTEGRITY
We take reasonable precautions to protect the privacy, accuracy and reliability of any information you provide
and to protect such information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
The Personally Identifiable Information you provide and we collect is stored within databases that we control
directly or through our service providers. As we deem appropriate, we use security measures consistent with
industry standards, such as firewalls and encryption technology, to protect your information. However, since
no security system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee
that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. As a result,
you transmit any information to or from www.KWCH.com at your own risk.
If you create an account on this www.KWCH.com, you may be asked to choose a password for your account,
in which case your online account information shall be protected by your password. We recommend that you
do not disclose your password to any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
your password and www.KWCH.com account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your
password or www.KWCH.com account. You can access and update information in your account profile at any
time by logging in to the website with your login name and password. Once you have logged in, you can
update certain of your information such as your name, e-mail, password, and/or change your address.
     ACCESSING AND DELETING PERSONALLY IDENITIFIABLE INFORMATION; OPT-OUT
If you have submitted Personally Identifiable Information through www.KWCH.com and you would like
access to such information, please send an e-mail to News@kwch.com. We will use reasonable efforts to
supply you with this information and to correct any factual inaccuracies that you identify. Please also contact
us at 831-1212 if you do not want us to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties or you
want us to delete your Personally Identifiable Information from our databases. Keep in mind, however, that
there may be residual information within our databases, access logs and other records, which may or may not
contain such information. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes; however, we
reserve the right, from time to time, to re-contact former Users of this www.KWCH.com.
                      AFFILIATED SITES, LINKED SITES AND ADVERTISEMENTS
Sunflower Broadcasting expects its partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our
Users. However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers
accessible through our www.KWCH.com, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and
practices. For example, during your visit to our www.KWCH.com you may link to, or view as part of an
Sunflower Broadcasting page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, you may
Page 5


be introduced to, or be able to access, information, websites or advertisement features offered by other parties
through www.KWCH.com. Sunflower Broadcasting is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third
parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on
a feature or page operated by a third party.
Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose
Personally Identifiable Information on our www.KWCH.com, such as completing an online form
request or e-mail link, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third
parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third
parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Sunflower Broadcasting and this Privacy Policy.
                                                   CHILDREN
We understand and share your concerns regarding your children’s access to Internet and the Internet’s access
to your children. Consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we do not
knowingly request or accept Personally Identifiable Information submitted to www.KWCH.com by any visitor
under 13 years of age. If we become aware that an individual under age 13 has provided information to
Sunflower Broadcasting through www.KWCH.com, we will not use or disclose that individual’s information
for any purpose unless required to do so by law.
                                        RIGHT TO CHANGE POLICY
Sunflower Broadcasting reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to alter this Privacy Policy at any time without
prior notice to any User, including to comply with privacy laws, regulations and/or our own or industry
standards or otherwise. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy each time you visit our
www.KWCH.com. Your use of our www.KWCH.com at any time, including after any change to this Privacy
Policy, indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, and any change made to this
