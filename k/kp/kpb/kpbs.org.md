# KPBS > About Us > Privacy Policy

**KPBS Internet Privacy Policy**

KPBS is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of our Internet site visitors and their children. KPBS adheres to a strict policy for preserving the integrity of personally identifiable information (such as full name, address, email address, telephone number and/or other identifiable information). Accordingly, we follow standard industry guidelines and will continue to review and improve our privacy policy and procedures to ensure the safety and protection of visitor information.

KPBS does, however, collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), the server your computer is logged into, the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for instance). This information is tracked for a better understanding of how our site is being used. This allows us to troubleshoot technical problems and to customize our editorial content. 

**Gathering and Use of Information**

1\. We will not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than what you supply to us on a voluntary basis.

2\. In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide some personally identifiable information. This could be in connection with the following: 

  * Auction, contest or special feature registration
  * Transactions for becoming a member or purchase of retail products



3\. KPBS and our affiliated Web sites will not willfully disclose your personal information to any third party without first receiving your permission.

4\. E-mail addresses provided in some registration modules allow KPBS to send e-mail to individuals based on areas of interest indicated during the registration process. If you do not wish to receive e-mailed advance notifications of information, simply do not click any of the subject boxes that may appear on the registration page. You will still have access to the site even if subject boxes are not marked.

5\. KPBS may use your personally identifiable information (that you provided voluntarily) for internal marketing purposes. Your prior approval will be required if KPBS shares or exchanges your personal information with another like-minded non profit. This is the only case where such information could potentially be provided to a third party.

**Tracking and Use of Cookies**

KPBS' Web site currently does not utilize "cookies" - special computer codes used to track user activity. 

1\. Cookies contain no information about you - only a unique number with no meaning whatsoever outside of the tracking system. Cookies help to target sponsorship information and measure effectiveness. Cookies can enhance the Internet user's experience on the Web by ensuring that you do not see the same sponsor information repeatedly.

2\. Cookies cannot be used to personally identify you in any way. All users who receive a sponsor message remain completely anonymous. If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature. In order to "opt out" of the benefits of cookies, you may delete your cookies by following the instructions contained in the Help section of your browser.

Some of our affiliated Web sites, such as PBS Online and Public Interactive modules, use cookie technology to offer special features such as localization options, sponsorship banners and badges on certain non-kids related Web pages.

By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this KPBS Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use the site. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of kpbs.org following the posting of any changes to these terms shall mean that you have accepted those changes.
