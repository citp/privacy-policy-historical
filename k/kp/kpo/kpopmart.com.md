**Information You Give Us** ﻿

We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. ﻿

**How We Protect Your Information** ﻿

To protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, we have implemented security measures at this website. When you place orders or access your account information, a secure server is employed. All information you input is encrypted by the secure server layer (SSL) before it is sent to us and all the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorized access.﻿

**E-mail Communication & Newsletter**﻿

To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from us if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.﻿

**Our Use of Cookies** ﻿

We send a "session cookie" to your computer if and when you log in to your account by entering your ID and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect. ﻿
