# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy of KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH (hereinafter referred to as “KTM”):**

We at KTM respect and protect the privacy of all our customers and visitors to our website (hereinafter “visitors”) and adhere strictly to the regulations under data protection law. Personal data will be collected on this website only to the extent required. Under no circumstances will the data stored be sold. The following policy gives you an overview of how we ensure this protection and the information required under Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation on the processing of your data, in particular which categories of data KTM stores in respect of the users of the website www.ktm.comand/or customers of authorized KTM dealers, and for what purpose. This Privacy Policy applies to all KTM websites and all products and services that KTM offers. In this context, this KTM Privacy Policy also applies in respect of all KTM group companies which may collect and/or process data.

**Collection and processing of personal data**

In general, it is not necessary to provide personal data in order to use our website. However, we may require your personal data insofar as it is necessary for the performance of a contract with us or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures (see Art. 6 (1) (b) of the GDPR). All your personal data, specifically your email address, your name, your residential address, and your date of birth, are collected by us only when you provide this to us, for example, in performing a contract, processing an order, in the context of a competition, providing informational material or a survey, as well as registering for newsletters. Visitors can of course choose not to provide any data in order to use the website anonymously, but must then be aware that some functions may in certain circumstances only be available to a limited extent.

KTM recognizes and respects the importance of the responsible use of the data collected from visitors and customers. KTM will not use this data to contact you and inform you of product news, services and offers without your permission.

**Transfer of personal data to third parties**

If required by law or contract, or if we have a legal and legitimate interest, it may be necessary in an individual case to submit your data to our group companies or external business partners.

Your data will not be sold, leased, or otherwise transmitted to external third parties. This does not include: trustworthy partners who support us in operating the website, in the course of doing business, or in other services in which it is, of course, ensured that they are obligated to maintain confidentiality. Within the scope of processing your order or request, we sometimes commission external business partners, who are, however, contractually obliged to comply with the data protection regulations.

The transmission of the data to the group companies of KTM or other third parties shall only take place to the extent such recipients have provided KTM with an undertaking to observe the applicable data protection regulations.

Insofar as we involve external business partners in the context of data processing, we have ensured that these have been selected and are monitored in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and are also obliged to comply with the data protection regulations and laws. Apart from this, your data is not transferred.

We also take in-house data protection within the group very seriously. Our employees and subcontracted business partners are obliged by us to maintain confidentiality and to adhere to the data protection regulations.

The respective KTM group company works with trustworthy partners.

Specifically, your personal data may be transmitted to the following group companies or business partners:

**Collection and storage of usage data**

When accessing the website, the following electronic communication metadata are stored: IP address, date and time of access, name of the file called up, sub-page as well as anonymous username, city, user’s region and country, user’s operating system, user’s browser, user’s browser version, user’s interactions on the website, pages visited by the user, duration of the session and number of sessions of the user, date of the first visit to the website, date and time of each interaction of the user, time spent on the website, duration of requests by the user, user’s requests, exception errors of the website, date and time and duration of exception errors. The data can be evaluated anonymously for statistical purposes. This data is kept strictly confidential and not transferred outside the KTM system or made accessible to other third parties, unless this is necessary to fulfill legal or contractual obligations or to fulfill the legal and legitimate interests of KTM.

We delete or anonymize your data as soon as it is no longer needed for the transmission of a communication. If the processing of the electronic communications metadata is for billing purposes, we shall retain the relevant communication metadata up to the end of the period during which the invoice may be legally challenged or the claim for payment asserted. We store this electronic communications metadata for a period of three years from the conclusion of the contract because in terms of the Austrian General Civil Code (ABGB) a claim on the grounds of error must be asserted within three years from conclusion of the contract (see Art. 1487 of the ABGB) and claims for supplies of goods or services to a commercial business lapse after three years (see Art. 1486, para. 1, line 1 of the ABGB).
