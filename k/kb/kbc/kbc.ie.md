#### Internet Fraud  
  
A number of banking organisations and their customers have from time to time been   
the target of hoax e-mails that are aimed at gathering Internet/account   
details of the customers. Some of these hoax e-mails have encouraged or facilitated contact with hoax websites that purport to be (but are not) the website of the relevant banking organisation. To date the occurrence of   
such online fraud has not been extensive. However, we would always   
advise you to be cautious as regards disclosing your personal details.   
In particular, you should note that we will only ever request your personal details if: (i) you are seeking to initiate   
e-mail contact with us via this Website; or (ii) you initiate a request for a particular service via this Website and we require certain of your personal details to provide you with the requested service.
