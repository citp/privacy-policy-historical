Privacy Statement for Online Media and Mobile Banking

**Introduction**

It is the policy of KBC Bank Ireland plc (including our subsidiaries and affiliates) (collectively and individually “KBCI”) to comply with the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to outline how KBCI deals with the Personal Data we collect about you or you provide to us while visiting our website, using our mobile banking applications (Apps) or when interacting with us through any of our social media or other interactive channels (collectively “KBC Online”).

When you visit KBC Online, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Statement. KBCI shall have no liability to you for any claims, losses or damages arising out of or in connection with the use, disclosure or other processing of your Personal Data in accordance with the Privacy Statement and your consents.

Types of information collected

We retain two types of information from users of KBC Online:

1\. “Personal Data”: This is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you and may include your name, postal address, email address, telephone number and birth date. The information you provide will be used for the purposes for which it was intended/submitted and as set out in this Privacy Statement.

2\. “Non-Personal Data”: Like most online operators, KBCI gather statistical and other analytical information collected on an aggregate basis of all visitors to our KBC Online platforms. This Non-Personal Data comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information regarding browser types, mobile device equipment, mobile network and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of KBC Online. KBCI collects this information to help us monitor online traffic and manage the performance, efficiency and capacity etc of KBC Online. This information also helps KBCI understand what parts of KBC Online are effective/well used and what parts are not being fully utilised.

**Cookies**

KBC Online uses “cookie” technology. KBCI will also use cookies to facilitate your use of the KBC Online Banking Service, where KBCI has agreed to give you access to that service.

**What are Cookies?**

Cookies are small pieces of information, stored in simple text files, placed on your computer by a website. Cookies can be read by the website on your subsequent visits so that you can access information in a faster and more efficient way. The information stored in a cookie may relate to your browsing habits on the web page, or a unique identification number so that the website can "remember" you on your return visit. Generally speaking, cookies do not contain Personal Data from which you can be identified, unless you have separately furnished such information to the website.

You can at any time set your browser or your mobile device settings to reject cookies. However if you reject our session cookies, this may affect your ability to use the KBCI Online Banking service and / or our website.  
For more information on how to manage cookies, including how to disable cookies please visit: www.aboutcookies.org.  
KBCI uses three different types of cookies: “session” cookies, “performance” cookies and "targeting" cookies.

**Session Cookies**

“Session” cookies help users to navigate across KBC Online pages. They are deleted once your leave our website. Session cookies do not contain anything other than a session identification number which allows the webserver to “remember” where you are online. Session cookies are especially important for using KBC Online Banking. Some examples of these cookies include:

• Identifying you as being signed in to KBC Online Banking and keeping you logged in throughout your visit.  
• Remembering the content of forms which you may have completed while you are on KBC Online.

**Performance Cookies**

“Performance” cookies are used by KBCI to provide information on the usage of KBC Online (details in relation to which pages on our website users visited, how they got there, what devices and mobile networks they were using etc). Some of these cookies are saved to your computer so that we know when you revisit KBC Online. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and used anonymously. We use these cookies to understand what content is popular which helps us to improve KBC Online. .

   **Targeting Cookies**

"Targeting" cookies remember individual websites you have visited. This assists KBCI in presenting relevant and targeted online advertising to you. When you visit a KBCI website page targeting cookies may be placed on your machine. Subsequently these targeting cookies (if they have been placed on your machine), can be recognised by subsequent websites you visit, and this allows those sites to present targeted KBCI advertising to you based on your previous web browsing activity. The information collected from these targeting cookies is anonymous.

**Biometric Information**

You have the option of providing us with your biometric information in the form of a self-portrait photo (or ‘selfie’) taken using your mobile device which we then use to identify you. We apply facial recognition technology to the photo in order to authenticate your presented identification documents (for example, your passport or driving licence) to assess its legitimacy for anti-money laundering purposes. [KBCI will not use this Personal Data for any other purpose].

**Touch ID  **

If you have an IOS device with Touch ID functionality (e.g. using your fingerprint to access your mobile device), you will be able to access the KBC Mobile Banking App using this Touch ID functionality however you will require your Mobile PIN to authorise transactions. If your device does not have Touch ID functionality you will automatically be logged into the KBC Mobile Banking App once you have entered your mobile PIN. Where you are using Touch ID functionality, we do not accept any liability for any loss arising in connection with the use of biometric data to access the mobiles service. For the avoidance of doubt please note we do not retain or store any biometric data.

**Social Media Sites**

If you are accessing KBC Online through a social media presence, such as Facebook or Twitter, you may be subject to cookies operated by those social media networks. We are not responsible for the activities of third party social media operators so you should check the privacy policies of those operators before using their facilities.
