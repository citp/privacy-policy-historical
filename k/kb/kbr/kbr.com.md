# Privacy Policy

## Who We Are

Thank you for your trust in KBR and for taking the time to read our Privacy Statement. KBR is an engineering, procurement, construction and services group of companies which supports the energy, hydrocarbons, power, industrial, civil infrastructure, minerals, government services and commercial sectors in more than 70 countries. This Privacy Statement is provided to let you know how we protect the privacy of personal information provided to us in connection with your use of this website.

## Purpose of This Privacy Statement

This Privacy Statement explains what KBR does with personal information provided to us through this Site, such as your name, mailing address or email address. It explains in general terms how we collect, use, share, store and safeguard that information, as well as our reasons for collecting it through this website. It also contains information on how to contact us if you have a question or concern.

## U.S. – E.U. and U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Certification

KBR has certified to a privacy program called Safe Harbor Certification that is co-sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission, for purposes of its human resources (employees, former employees, temporary personnel and job applicants) personal information. The program applies to personal information pertaining to residents of the European Union and Switzerland to the extent that the data is transferred to or accessible by KBR companies in the United States. U.S. companies that certify to the Safe Harbor program voluntarily agree to adhere to seven Safe Harbor privacy and security Principles, as well as the surrounding obligations of the program. The seven Safe Harbor Principles that KBR has certified to uphold are: Notice, Choice (Consent), Onward Transfer, Access, Data Integrity, Security and Enforcement. You can learn more about the Safe Harbor program and the requirements that KBR and other companies that have certified must uphold at: www.export.gov/safeharbor/ and can also view KBR’s Safe Harbor certification form on file with the U.S. Department of Commerce through that website.

## Collection of Your Information

Much of our website does not require any form of registration or identification. However, some functions of our website may require registration, such as those that necessarily require us to identify you in order to answer a question that you may ask. It is up to you to choose whether you want to register for any programs through our site which may be available to the general public (such as investor relations webcasts). It may not be possible for you to gain access to certain parts of the site that are restricted to certain registered users. If you register for a KBR program or service, we offer you the option to discontinue your consent ("opting out" or "unsubscribing") if you later decide that you no longer want to participate in the program or service.

## Collection of Anonymous Computer Information /“Cookies”

Like virtually all websites, this website collects anonymous information known as “cookies” if your computer is set to allow that type of collection. (You can turn off the ability to collect some of this information on most computers.) This allows us to evaluate how our website performs and to monitor traffic to the site. (For those who are interested in the details, some of the typical computer techniques we may use are "cookies", "internet tags" which are also called "action tags", "single-pixel GIFs", clear GIFs, "invisible GIFs, and "1-by-1 GIFs). If you would like more information about web tags and cookies associated with on-line advertising or how to opt-out of third-party collection of information, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative website, an independent website not sponsored by or affiliated with KBR.

## Sharing Your Information with Third-Parties

KBR does not sell or share your personal information with unaffiliated third-parties, such as marketers, for their own separate use. When you provide personal information to us through our website, it may be accessible to some of our' business partners, such as companies we retain to fulfill requests for information, or provide assistance to us on specific programs or projects. We require third-party business partners to protect personal information in accordance with applicable laws and in a way that is consistent with KBR’s standards. We also obtain written assurances from them that they will not use your personal information for any separate use or allow other third parties that they may retain to do so.

There may also be instances where we may be required to share your information with third-parties who are not our business partners, such as in connection with fulfilling our legal or compliance obligations. Please note that most entities receiving personally identifiable information under these conditions (e.g., courts, the police, other law enforcement agencies) have legal obligations under the privacy and security laws to protect your information.

Personal Information collected from you may also be transferred to a third party in the event that a part of your business (or this website) is sold, assigned or transferred. If so, we would require the buyer, assignee or transferee to treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

## Sharing Your Information with Other KBR Companies

The information that you provide to us may sometimes be shared with other KBR companies (subsidiaries and affiliates within the KBR global group.) If so, and regardless of the KBR company or its location, we require that they uphold a similar level of protection for your data as that described in this Privacy Statement.

## Security and Protection of Your Information

We use appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect data that pertains to you from loss, misuse or alteration, and update these safeguards to address new threats and changes in the legal requirements. At the same time, you should recognize that no organization can guarantee the absolute security of personal information.

## Transfer of Your Information

When KBR transfers personal information to countries other than the country where the information was provided, we take steps to ensure that your data is protected.

## Protection of Children

This website is not intended for use by minors and our business (including our website) is not the type that would naturally attract the attention or interest of minors. We comply with the laws of the U.S. and other countries that protect the privacy of children.

## Accessing Your Information

To the extent that KBR holds any identifiable information about individuals that was collected through this website, we comply with applicable laws relating to access and alteration of that data. All requests to update or access your information will be subject to verification of the identity of the requesting individual.

## Updates to this Privacy Statement

We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time. If we do so, we apply any changes that we make to personal information that we collect after the changes are posted.
