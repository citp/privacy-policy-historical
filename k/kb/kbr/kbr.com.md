## Collection of Your Information

Much of our website does not require any form of registration or identification. However, some functions of our website may require registration, such as those that necessarily require us to identify you in order to answer a question that you may ask. It is up to you to choose whether you want to register for any programs through our site which may be available to the general public (such as investor relations webcasts). It may not be possible for you to gain access to certain parts of the site that are restricted to certain registered users. If you register for a KBR program or service, or otherwise provide personal information to us through this website, KBR limits the collection of your personal information to that which is appropriate and proportionate for the intended use.  This may include, for example, your name, contact details, and other personal information relevant to the purpose for which you are visiting our website. We also  offer you the option to discontinue your consent ("opting out" or "unsubscribing") if you later decide that you no longer want to participate in the program or service.

## Collection of Anonymous Computer Information /“Cookies”

Like virtually all websites, this website collects anonymous information known as “cookies” if your computer is set to allow that type of collection. “Cookies” are small pieces of data sent from a website and stored on a website user's web browser while a user is browsing a website.  (You can turn off the ability to collect some of this information on most computers, and can learn more about how to do so, as well as the types of ‘cookies’ that we collect, by clicking on our Cookies Notice.) As further explained in our Cookies Notice, the use of cookies does not harm your computer or directly identify individuals.  Rather, their use allows us to evaluate how our website performs and to monitor traffic to the site. (For those who are interested in the details, some of the typical computer techniques we may use are "cookies", "internet tags" which are also called "action tags", "single-pixel GIFs", clear GIFs, "invisible GIFs, and "1-by-1 GIFs).

## Sharing Your Information with Third-Parties

KBR does not sell or share your personal information with unaffiliated third-parties, such as marketers, for their own separate use. When you provide personal information to us through our website, it may be accessible to some of our business partners, such as companies we retain to fulfil requests for information, or provide assistance to us on specific programs or projects. We require third-party business partners to protect personal information in accordance with applicable laws and in a way that is consistent with KBR’s standards. We also obtain written assurances from them that they will not use your personal information for any separate use or allow other third parties that they may retain to do so.

There may also be instances where we may be required to share your information with third-parties who are not our business partners, such as in connection with fulfilling our legal or compliance obligations.

Personal Information collected from you may also be transferred to a third party in the event that a part of your business (or this website) is sold, assigned or transferred.
