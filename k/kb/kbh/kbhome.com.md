Further, you may remove your email address from the distribution lists of KB HOME or our business partners at anytime by notifying us or the business partners, respectively.

Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we may collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties, or to third parties' advertisers who may advertise on the Website, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of personal information you disclose to them. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to third parties.
