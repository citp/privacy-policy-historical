We may also receive personal information from you, for example when you: respond to a research survey with a marketing research supplier such as Harris Interactive or provide personal information in Blue Book® Value Feedback comments. 

When you visit KBB pages, we may collect certain information about your visit from your browser, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet, the date and time you access the KBB Web site, the pages that you access while at the KBB Web site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to the KBB Web site, and KBB cookie information. KBB aggregates non-specific visitor information for statistical purposes, such as the production of the KBB Blue Book [Most Researched Cars](https://web.archive.org/kb/ki.dll/ke.kb.sp?kbb&&55&TopList) list.

KBB and/or the third party may use your personal information to process your request and provide valuable services. KBB will only share your personal information with trusted third parties under a confidentiality agreement or similar arrangement that restricts the third party from sharing your personal information with others. 

If you do not want your information to be used for marketing by KBB and/or a third party, do not "opt in" or agree to such use when you provide your personal information through the KBB Web site.

Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy.

You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information. 

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also transfer personal information about you if KBB is acquired by or merged with another company.

Cookies

KBB may set and access KBB cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a Web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information (such as your ZIP Code) on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized. 

KBB lets other companies, including business partners and companies that show advertisements on some of our pages, set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. Advertisers or other companies may have access to KBB's cookies. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other Web sites you visit. 

Web Beacons

KBB uses Web beacons (also known as clear gif technology, or action tags) to access KBB cookies inside and outside our Web site and to collect data and allow other companies to collect data. Web beacons may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our site. This technology is a tool we may also use to compile aggregated statistics about the KBB Web site usage, such as how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a page. We may share aggregated site statistics with other companies, and we may allow other companies to place their clear gifs or cookies on our site. 

_Protection of Children's Personal Information_

  
KBB is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
