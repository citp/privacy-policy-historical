When you list a car for sale, we ask for information on the car and on how you can be contacted by potential buyers (including information like your phone number and email address). We also ask for your credit card number and the expiration date on your card.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

We may release or use information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with laws; to respond to legal process or to a valid law enforcement request; to enforce our Visitor Agreement; or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our website, our customers, the public or Kelley. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Kelley, one of its business units, or substantially all of its assets is acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets.

Kelley does not rent, sell, or share your personal information with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

When you elect to receive information from Kelley, automobile manufacturers and local dealers and/or from Kelley's valued providers (finance, insurance, etc.), Kelley will use and/or share your personal information only as you have elected.

When you request a [Free Dealer Price Quote](https://web.archive.org/free-dealer-price-quote/), more information about a particular vehicle, or to be contacted by a dealer regarding a new or used vehicle, your personal information (including your contact information) may be forwarded by Kelley directly to the dealer or may be provided by Kelley to an automobile manufacturer or a trusted business partner that will forward your personal information to the dealer. Your personal information may also be forwarded by Kelley, the dealer, the automobile manufacturer or a trusted business partner to a trusted business partner or service provider, for the purpose of verifying your personal information, reviewing buyer purchase activity and reporting aggregate vehicle transaction data (excluding your personal information) to Kelley, the dealer, the automobile manufacturer, and/or a trusted business partner.

Please be aware that when you provide personal information to Kelley and authorize Kelley to share that information with a third party, your personal information becomes the property of Kelley and/or the third party. Kelley and/or the third party may use your personal information to process your request and provide valuable services. Keep in mind that once Kelley shares your personal information with a dealer or other third party as you have requested, Kelley may no longer have control over the use of the information by those third parties.

Kelley may share non-personal information about your interaction with the Kelley Site and other Web sites in order to provide interest-based ads to you and others on the Kelley Site or on other websites. Kelley and its trusted partners and third-party advertising companies may note some of the pages you visit through the use of pixel tags.

When we use other companies to help us operate our website or improve the services we offer to you, we may provide them with information about our visitors that is necessary for them to perform their services. We require that these companies commit to use the information only to perform the services that we request.

If you choose to unsubscribe in response to an email message that we send on behalf of an advertiser, we will share your email address and opt-out instructions with the advertiser. Similarly, if we ask a third-party company to send its customers email offers on our behalf, we will share with that company (or its agent) a list of email addresses collected from website visitors who have opted out of our email program. 

Although we take appropriate measures to protect against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that the information we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy policy.

We may share this information with our affiliates, including AutoTrader Group, Inc. and any of their subsidiaries, so that we and they may provide you with information, products, and services that we believe may be of interest to you.

### Cookies

Kelley may set and access Kelley cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and are encoded so they can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a Web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information (such as your ZIP Code) on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized.

Kelley lets other companies, including business partners and companies that show advertisements on some of our pages, set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies.

We may share aggregated site statistics with other companies, and we may allow other companies to place their pixels and/or set cookies on our site.

Cookies, beacons, information collected about your computer or device, and other data collection technologies ("Data Technologies") may be used individually or in combination in order to provide and/or administer our services, to help us understand user behavior, to monitor website performance, optimize ads and measure advertising performance.
