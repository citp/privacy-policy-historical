[_How To Contact Us_](https://web.archive.org/kf/About/legalprivacy.htm#howto)

#### Types Of Information We Collect

**_Personally-Identifiable Information_**

On our website, we collect certain personally-identifiable information about our online visitors. Personally-identifiable information relates to an individual consumer - for example, name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. You may provide personally-identifiable information, for example, by registering on our site or by entering a promotion. We don’t require you to register or provide personally-identifiable information to view our site or access much of its content, such as our many delicious recipes. But if you register, you may use certain additional features like "Your Recipe Box" or "Recipes By E-Mail." Also, the more detailed the information you provide in the "Your Profile" section of the website, the better we are able to customize your website experience. Here are the ways we collect personally-identifiable information.

_Registration_

To take full advantage of all our offerings, you may choose to register on our site. In the registration process, we request certain information (such as your contact information and age range) so we can provide you with the communications you request, tailor our website to better meet your needs and customize our contacts with you. We also may use the registration information you provide for other purposes to which you consent. 

_Contests, Sweepstakes and Games_

Our site contains notices of contests, sweepstakes and games we are conducting, which you may enter electronically in some cases. We use the information you provide to conduct the promotion (for example, to contact you if you’re a winner). We won’t use the information you provide to enter the promotion for any other purpose unless you’ve agreed otherwise.

 _Recipes By E-mail_

When you ask us to send you recipes and other cooking ideas by e-mail, you may provide us with certain information like your e-mail address so we can fulfill your request.

 _Healthy Living_

You can sign up through the Healthy Living channel of this site to receive your own customized meal and fitness plans and other offerings. If you sign up, we ask you for certain information so we can provide you with the communications you requested.

 _Recipe Ratings and Recipe Connection_

When you use our Recipe Ratings or Recipe Connection function, you may submit information in the form of a recipe, rating or review of a recipe. Remember that comments you post are publicly available, so please exercise caution when deciding whether to disclose anything personal about yourself.

 _"Contact Us" Link_

If you e-mail us through the "Contact Us" link on this site, we ask you for information such as your first name and e-mail address so we can respond to your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information as well.

 _Shop Kraft_

When you ask us to send you certain Kraft products or promotional items, we request your contact information (such as postal and e-mail address) and payment information (such as credit card number) so we can fulfill your request. We use this information only to send you the items you ordered. We may use service providers to help us fulfill your order. We share information about you with these service providers only for this purpose. 

_Tell A Friend_

We may give you the opportunity to tell your friends about new features on our website. If you take advantage of our Tell A Friend option, we ask you for your friend’s and your first name and e-mail addresses. We use your friend’s name and e-mail address only to send the information you requested we forward. We don’t keep your friend’s e-mail address or use it for any other purpose. We don’t keep your e-mail address or use it for any other purpose unless you’ve given us permission to do so. 

_Other Site Features_

We offer visitors to our website various features for their enjoyment, which we change from time to time. We may ask you to submit certain personally-identifiable information so we can provide you with these features. ****

 _Questionnaires and Surveys_

We occasionally ask visitors to our website to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us understand the needs of our visitors. We do not keep any personally-identifiable information about you in connection with your participation in a website survey unless you specifically agree to provide this information.


 ** _Aggregate and Non-Personal Information_**

We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when you visit our website. Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable visitor. It tells us such things as how many users visited our site, the pages accessed and the recipes viewed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors. We collect this information either through "cookie" technology or with "web beacons," as explained below. 

_Cookies_

Like many companies, we use "cookies" on our website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. 

When you visit our website, cookies are placed on your computer. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you’ve visited us before or if you’re a new visitor and to help us identify site features and recipes in which you may have the greatest interest. We collect this information to enhance your experience on our website.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Remember, though, without cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of Kraft’s website features.

_Web Beacons_

Certain pages on our site contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.




#### **How We Use Personally-Identifiable Information**

We may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time. For example, we may (i) send you promotional materials and other communications you request, (ii) respond to your comments or questions, or (iii) contact you if needed while processing a product or service you requested through our website. We also may use the information you provide to contact you for your opinions on Kraft products or the website.

We also use personally-identifiable information about you to improve our website features and content and to analyze website usage. In addition, we use personally-identifiable information for market research purposes. We also may use personally-identifiable information about you to deliver content that is customized to your interests as we understand them from the information you’ve provided to us and your activities on the site. This customized content may include recipes, product information and promotions.

#### **How We Share Personally-Identifiable Information**

Except as described below, we don’t sell, transfer or otherwise disclose to third parties the personally-identifiable information we collect on this website without your prior consent. We disclose information where we think it’s necessary to investigate or prevent an actual or suspected crime or injury to ourselves or others or where disclosure is required by law. We also may disclose information in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials. We also disclose information to third parties we retain to perform services on our behalf. For example, we hire service providers to help us run promotions, fulfill orders you may place and provide customer service. These service providers may have access to personally-identifiable information about our website visitors if it is needed to perform their functions for Kraft, but they are not authorized by Kraft to use the information for their own marketing purposes.

On our website, we may conduct joint promotions with other companies. We may share with our promotional partners (and their service providers) certain personally-identifiable information as necessary to conduct the promotion. We will not share this information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless you tell us it’s ok to do so.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

#### **Links To Other Websites**

This website may contain links to other websites. We provide these links solely for your convenience and information. Different websites have different privacy practices. You should always check the privacy notice of the specific site you’re visiting to understand the privacy practices associated with that site.

#### **Your Choices**

You can change your preferences for follow-up contacts by Kraft. If you’re registered with www.kraftfoods.com, you can change the information you’ve provided to us in the "Your Profile" section of the site. If you’re not registered with this site, you can change your preferences by [_clicking here_](http://www.kraftfoods.com/update). If you prefer, you can cancel your registration altogether. [E-mail us](http://www.kraftfoods.com/main.aspx?m=contact_us/cu_form1) if you wish to take this action. ****

#### **Children’s Privacy**

Some portions of our website may be directed to kids under 13. In these areas of our website, our conduct is governed by federal law and regulations that address children’s online privacy, as well as by the guidelines of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU), a part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.

We do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from kids under 13 on our website, except as permitted by legal requirements and the CARU guidelines. We sometimes offer promotions on our website, such as contests, sweepstakes and games. We may permit a child to enter promotions directed to children by submitting a first name and e-mail address only, along with the name and e-mail address of the child’s parent. We then notify the parent about the child’s entry and offer the parent an opportunity to withdraw the entry and remove the submitted information from our database. If the parent permits the child’s participation in the promotion and the child wins, we contact the parent (not the child) for further information needed for any prize delivery. Unless the parent has explicitly consented, we do not (i) use the child’s personal information for any purpose other than to complete the promotion or (ii) share the information with third parties except as described above in this Privacy Notice. We do not retain the child’s or the parent’s personally-identifiable information in our database unless the parent has given us permission to do so.

We permit children under the age of 13 to contact us through the website "Contact Us" link with questions or comments. We request only the child’s first name and e-mail address and use that information solely to respond directly to the child on a one-time basis. We do not use the information to recontact the child and we delete the child’s personal information from our database after responding to the child’s inquiry.

Upon proper identification, a parent may review any personal information we have collected from his or her child if we still have the information in our database. The parent also may request that the child’s information be deleted from our database and may refuse to permit further collection or use of the child’s information. If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights, please contact us as described below.

#### **How We Protect Personally-Identifiable Information**

The security of personally-identifiable information is important to us. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personally-identifiable information we collect on this website.

#### **Updates To This Privacy Notice**

We may change or update portions of this Privacy Notice at any time. Please check back from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the notice. We will indicate the notice’s effective date on the first page of the notice.
