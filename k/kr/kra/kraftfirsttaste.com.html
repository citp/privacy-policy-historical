<a name="typesOfInfo"></a><h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<a name="personallyIdentifiable"></a><h3>Personally-Identifiable Information You Provide Us</h3>
<p>On our website, we collect certain personally-identifiable information about our online visitors. Personally-identifiable information relates to an individual consumer – for example, name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. You may provide personally-identifiable information, for example, by registering on our site or by entering a promotion. We don't require you to register or provide personally-identifiable information to view our site. However, we do require you to provide this information in order to participate in the opportunities on our site, such as "My Offers."   Also, the more detailed the information you provide in the "Account Settings" section of the website, the better we are able to customize your website experience.  Here are the ways we collect personally-identifiable information.</p>
<a name="registration"></a><h4>Registration</h4>
<p>To take advantage of our offerings, you may choose to register on our website. In the registration process, we request certain information, such as your contact information and birth date, so we can contact you about your registration and about promotions, opportunities and offers. We also use this information to provide you with e-mail newsletters and postings about our website.  You can unsubscribe to these communications by following the "unsubscribe" link included with each issue.  In addition, we may use this information to provide you with communications, samples and information you request, to tailor our website to better meet your needs; to customize our contacts with you; and to develop new products and services that meet your needs. We may also use the registration information you provide for other purposes to which you consent.</p>
<a name="contests"></a><h4>Contests, Sweepstakes and Games</h4>
<p>Our site, at times, may contain notices of contests, sweepstakes and games we are conducting, which you may enter electronically in some cases. We use the information you provide to conduct the promotion (for example, to contact you if you're a winner). We won't use the information you provide to enter the promotion for any other purpose unless you've agreed otherwise.</p>
<a name="campaigns"></a><h4>Individual Campaigns</h4>
<p>If you choose to participate in a campaign, such as a coupon or sample offer, or use online community tools, we may require some additional information, such as your geographic location.  In addition, by participating in a campaign, we will be tracking your activities related to the campaign.</p>
<a name="contactUs"></a><h4>"Contact Us" Link</h4>
<p>If you e-mail us through the "Contact Us" link on this site, we ask you for information such as your first name and e-mail address so we can respond to your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information as well.</p>
<a name="sendToAFriend"></a><h4>Tell A Friend</h4>
<p>We may give you the opportunity to tell your friends about our website or send them special offers. If you take advantage of our Tell-A-Friend option, we ask you for your friend's first name and your first name and e-mail addresses. We use your friend's name and e-mail address only to send the information you requested we forward. We don't keep your friend's e-mail address or use it for any other purpose without their consent.</p>
<a name="forums"></a><h4>Interactive Forums</h4>
<p>If you wish to participate in one of our interactive forums, such as blogs, forums or product recommendations, you may choose to post personally-identifiable information.  Remember that comments you post are publicly available to our members, so please exercise caution when deciding whether to disclose or post anything personal about yourself.</p>
<a name="featuredMembers"></a><h4>Featured Members</h4>
<p>We may select registered members from time to time to be highlighted on our website.  Through the feedback survey, these members can agree to be "Featured Members." They will be featured on the website with their name, photo and comments.</p>
<a name="otherSite"></a><h4>Other Site Features</h4>
<p>We offer members of our website various features for their enjoyment, which we change from time to time. We may ask you to submit certain personally-identifiable information so we can provide you with these features.</p>
<a name="questionnaires"></a><h4>Questionnaires and Surveys</h4>
<p>We occasionally ask visitors to our website to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us understand the needs of our visitors. We may keep personally-identifiable information about you in connection with your participation in our website surveys and opinion polls.</p>
<a name="automated"></a><h3>Information We Collect by Automated Means</h3>
<p>We collect certain information by automated means when you visit our website, such as how many users have visited the website, the pages they have accessed and the products viewed.  We also collect the IP addresses of our website visitors.  By collecting this information, we learn how to improve our website.  We collect this information through various means, including "cookies," "web beacons" and "log files."</p>
<a name="cookies"></a><h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Like many companies, we use "cookies" on our website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.</p>
<p>When you visit our website, cookies are placed on your computer. We use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you've visited us before or if you're a new visitor and to help us identify site features and products in which you may have the greatest interest. We collect this information to enhance your experience on our website.  We also use cookies to track users' movements through the website.</p>
<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Remember, though, without cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all of our website features.</p>
<a name="webBeacons"></a><h4>Web Beacons</h4>
<p>Certain pages on our site contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.</p>
<a name="logFiles"></a><h4>Log Files</h4>
<p>As is true of many websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the website, and to identify and solve hardware and software problems as they arise. We may link this automatically-collected data to your personally-identifiable information for the purpose of determining your interests and to offer you goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<a name="tracking"></a><h3>Tracking and Merging Information from Other Sources</h3>
<p>If you register on our website and provide us with personally-identifiable information, we may link information we collect by automated means with the personally-identifiable information you provided us online.  We may also supplement the personally-identifiable information we collect from you with non-personal or personal information from other, third party sources.  We will merge this third party information with the information we collect on this website.  The composite information about you will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Notice. We perform this tracking and merging to assist us in evaluating and improving our website, products, and services; to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our website, products, and services to your needs; to provide you with targeted marketing offers that we think may be of interest to you; and to study marketing-related questions in general.</p>
<a name="howWeUse"></a><h2>How We Use Personally-Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>We may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time. For example, we may (i) send you promotional materials, (ii) respond to your comments or questions, (iii) contact you if needed while processing a product or service you request through our website, or (iv) send you any communications you request. We also may use the information you provide to contact you for your opinions on Kraft products or the website, or on other products and services that may be featured on our website.</p>
<p>We also use personally-identifiable information about you to improve our website features and content and to analyze website usage. In addition, we use personally-identifiable information for market research purposes. We also may use personally-identifiable information about you to deliver content that is customized to your interests as we understand them from the information you've provided to us and your activities on the site. This customized content may include recipes, product information and promotions.</p>
<a name="howWeShare"></a><h2>How We Share Personally-Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell or otherwise disclose personally-identifiable information about our website visitors, except as described here.  We may share the information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. For example, we hire service providers to help us operate this website and fulfill your orders. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.</p>
<p>On our website, we may conduct joint promotions with other companies. We may share with our promotional partners (and their service providers) certain personally-identifiable information as necessary to conduct the promotion. We will not share this information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless you tell us it's okay to do so.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to direct the transferee to use personal information provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.</p>
<a name="links"></a><h2>Links To Other Websites</h2>
<p>This website may contain links to other websites. We provide these links solely for your convenience and information. Different websites have different privacy practices. You should always check the privacy notice of the specific site you're visiting to understand the privacy practices associated with that site.
