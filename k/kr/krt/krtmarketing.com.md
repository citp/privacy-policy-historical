### WHAT DATA WE COLLECT AND WHY

* * *

##### TRACKING OF WEBSITE VISITS

How  
The Websites listed above use Google Analytics (GA) to track user engagement. GA automatically records geographical location, device type, internet browser and operating system (OS), but none of this information personally identifies you. GA also records your computer’s IP address which could personally identify you, but we do not have access to that information.

Please check [Google’s developer guides](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage) to learn more about how GA uses cookies.

The KRT Marketing Websites also use the following track codes: 

  * [HubSpot](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/account/how-does-hubspot-track-visitors) tracks visitors by using browser cookies. Visitors will be tracked anonymously before they pro-actively provide their personal information through one of our lead generation forms.
  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/) track visitors anonymously. This means that third parties, including Facebook, may use cookies, web beacons and other storage technologies to collect and/or receive information from our website and elsewhere on the internet, and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads.



We consider LinkedIn, Facebook, Google and HubSpot to be third-party data processors. 

Why  
The purpose for collecting website visits data is to measure website traffic and better understand how visitors are interacting with its pages so we can improve user experience and the content we offer.

When it comes to LinkedIn and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel) tracking, cookies are also used to show personalized and relevant advertising while visitors are not on our website – including remarketing. 

Controlling Cookies  
Disabling cookies on your internet browser will prevent engagement tracking on the above-mentioned websites. You can learn how to manage cookies [here](https://www.aboutcookies.org/). You can opt-out of targeted advertising from networks KRT Marketing may work with by setting your preferences here: <http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/>; if you are within the European Union, you may visit: <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/>

##### INBOUND DATA COLLECTION

Some information on our website is gated – which means it requires visitors to provide their personal data (typically name, company and email address – but not limited to this information) in order to access resources on our websites.

KRT Marketing will have access to your information in HubSpot, MailChimp and JotForm. We may use these platforms to send you regular recruitment marketing communications. All the information (data) submitted by you will be stored in HubSpot’s database for the duration of our contract with HubSpot, or until you actively request removal from the database. The information in MailChimp and JotForm will be stored in the respective databases for a maximum of three (3) years.

How this information will be used:  
We may send you emails about the recruitment marketing industry, including (but not limited to) articles, links, event invitations and KRT Marketing service communications. You can unsubscribe from these emails at any time.

We may contact you via email or phone with service information and offers.
