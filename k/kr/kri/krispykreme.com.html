    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
    
    <h3>Krispy Kreme Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation (“Krispy Kreme”) is committed to both protecting the privacy of users of this website located at www.krispykreme.com (the “Site”), and to providing those users with as many opportunities and services as possible. This Privacy Policy covers Krispy Kreme’s treatment of personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information that Krispy Kreme collects when users and visitors to this Site (“you”) use the Site’s features. Except as otherwise required by law, this policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Krispy Kreme does not own or control, or to people that Krispy Kreme does not employ or manage.</p>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>Krispy Kreme collects personally identifiable information on the Site in areas such as (i) the “Friends of Krispy Kreme” section and (ii) during on-line shopping. Personal information includes, among other things, user name, credit card number, address, telephone number and e-mail address or other Internet address. Fields in which we collect such required information will be marked with an “**.” We share your information with our customer call center, licensed franchisees, store operators and external service providers (for example, mailing houses and IT services providers) who have agreed to follow our Privacy Policy with respect to that information. We use the above information to fulfill product orders. We also may ask for date of birth, gender, and information about your interests and other personal information so that we can combine such information with the information described above. We use that information so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the Internet to provide you with services and offers, but you may always choose whether to respond or not. From time to time, we may disclose personally identifiable information to government entities when such disclosure is required by law. We also receive personally identifiable information when you apply for a job in the “Career” section of the Site. Any such information gathered through the Career section of the Site will be used solely to evaluate whether your background and experience makes you a candidate for a career with Krispy Kreme.</p>
<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>In addition to personal information, Krispy Kreme may also gather non-personally identifiable information which may be used by Krispy Kreme. Generally, “non-personally identifiable information” means information that is collected through “traffic data” and may entail the use of “cookies,” “IP addresses,” “pixel tags” or other numeric codes used to identify a computer or monitor how or when a user accesses the Site or communications.</p>
<h3>About IP Addresses</h3>
<p>Krispy Kreme collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Web. Web servers – the big computers that "serve" up Web pages – automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When guests request pages from the Site, our servers log the guests’ IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user’s session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.</p>
<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you’re at our Site. The use of cookies is an Industry standard – you’ll find them at most major websites. This Site uses cookies. By showing how and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. Krispy Kreme does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described below, Krispy Kreme does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. Krispy Kreme does not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as on-line shopping (see above) and contest registration (where a cookie allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time). You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers and/or partners. Krispy Kreme does not control these cookies, and a different cookie policy may apply to them. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you’d prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so.</p>
<h3>Use of Pixel Tags</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to our Site may have previously received targeted promotional materials relative to the Site. Krispy Kreme shares Site usage information about such visitors with a reputable third-party advertising company for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising company use pixel tags (sometimes also called “clear GIFs”). Pixel tags are small graphic files, invisible to the human eye, which allow websites or other on-line services to track users. Krispy Kreme and our third-party advertising company uses pixel tags in HTML-enabled e-mail to track whether (and when) the recipient opened the message. We do not use pixel tags to identify specific individuals, but rather to gather statistics regarding the receipt of the HTML-enabled e-mails that we send.</p>
<h3>Policies For Individuals 13 Years of Age or Older</h3>
<p>By submitting information, individuals 13 years of age or older agree that such information may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Krispy Kreme, although we do not currently sell your name or other information to third parties and do not currently intend to do so in the future. Krispy Kreme may retain your personal information and other information you provide to us. We collect and retain this information in order to be able to provide you with information about Krispy Kreme. We also provide you information about upcoming product introductions, store openings and the like. We also use information that you provide to better design our website and to improve our marketing strategy and products. We share your information with our customer call center, licensed franchisees, store operators and external service providers (for example, mailing houses and IT services providers) who have agreed to follow our Privacy Policy with respect to that information. Krispy Kreme reserves the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the Site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of health and safety.</p>
<h3>Communication from Site</h3>
<p>You may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals and a newsletter. If you have submitted information to the Career portion of the Site, we may also contact you with regard to potential jobs. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option to not receive these types of communications. If at any time you wish to opt-out of receiving further communications from our Site, please contact friends@krispykreme.com. If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address.</p>
<h3>Reviewing, Updating and Deleting Personal Information</h3>
<p>If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact us and we will take reasonable steps to correct this information. To review or update your personal information, or if you wish your personal information to be deleted, please contact <a href="mailto:friends@krispykreme.com">friends@krispykreme.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>The privacy of information we receive from young children is of special importance to us. Accordingly, Krispy Kreme has developed certain privacy practices in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), and we desire to comply fully with that Act. In order to do so, we have established certain notification requirements and safeguards in order to notify parents and provide them with ways to update or remove a child’s information from our records and to communicate with us. Notwithstanding any statement to the contrary contained herein, the following policies and practices apply when a child 12 years old or younger provides personal information on our site (and when we use the word “child” or any form thereof, we mean only individuals 12 years old and younger).</p>
<p>The Information We Collect: Krispy Kreme collects the following information on our website from children 12 years old or younger: first name, last name, address, e-mail address, phone number, birthday, and parent’s name, e-mail and physical address.</p>
<p>How Personal Information is Used: Krispy Kreme will not use the information we receive from a child 12 years old or younger in any way until Krispy Kreme receives the parent’s or legal guardian’s consent to our use of the information. After we receive a parent’s consent, we will utilize the personal information we collect about a child to enable us to offer information about our website, and/or about our products or other items we sell, and/or about any special events, as well as for our internal marketing plans and purposes. Unless the parent or guardian of a child specifically registers on our website to himself or herself receive information from us, we will not use his or her e-mail address for any reason except to communicate with the parent or guardian in order to notify that parent or guardian about the child’s desire to register on our website and to effect and validate the registration of his or her child. After we receive the parent’s or guardian’s response to our request for information, we may, at our option, maintain the parent’s information in our internal records, but only to allow us to demonstrate that we have complied with our Privacy Policy and with applicable laws.</p>
<p>Krispy Kreme will not share or sell or intentionally make any child’s personal information we have collected available to anyone outside our company. We will use the information identified above only for internal purposes (subject, however, to the exceptions we have specifically identified in this Privacy Policy), including sharing the information with our affiliates, subsidiaries and franchisees that have agreed to follow our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Requirement for Participation: Krispy Kreme does not require a child to provide personal information before allowing the child to participate in an activity on the website.</p>
<p>Obtaining Parental Consent: Below parents and legal guardians will find information regarding how they can give Krispy Kreme permission to register a child on our website and permit them to receive the information we provide to our website registrants.</p>
<p>Children who are 12 years old or younger will be asked to provide us with their parent’s or guardian’s name, e-mail address and physical address. After we receive the information, we will send an e-mail to the parent or guardian stating that the child is attempting to register on our website and providing the parent or guardian with the URL, user name and a password to access the information the child has provided to us.</p>
<p>When a parent submits the child’s registration information, an e-mail is sent to the child notifying them that the submission has been made and that the child is now officially registered on the website.</p>
<p>How To Change Or Modify Parental Consent: The parent or guardian of a child may request that Krispy Kreme review, modify or delete any personal information about a child that we have collected by contacting us at friends@krispykreme.com.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Send Us An E-mail: Send an e-mail to friends@krispykreme.com. You must include your user name, e-mail address and specific instructions on what you would like us to do.<br>2. Send Us Mail: Send us your request via U.S. mail. You must include your name and specific instructions on what you would like us to do. Send to: "Join Friends of Krispy Kreme,” c/o Customer Experience, P.O. Box 83, Winston-Salem, NC 27102.</p>
<h3>Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>Krispy Kreme has implemented technology policies to protect any personal information that we use from misuse and loss. These policies are also designed to protect personal information from unauthorized access, modification and disclosure. We will update these measures as new technology becomes available, as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Privacy and Change of Control</h3>
<p>In the event Krispy Kreme goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
<h3>Consent</h3>
<p>By using this Site, you consent to the collection, use and storage of your information by us in the manner described in this Privacy Policy and elsewhere on the Site. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. If this Privacy Policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on this page. Regularly reviewing this page ensures that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.</p>
<h3>Other Krispy Kreme Websites</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to this Site. The policies of other websites operated by Krispy Kreme or its affiliates may vary because of local customs, practices, laws or due to circumstances unique to that website. Please review the privacy policy of each website to determine the privacy policies of that website.</p>
