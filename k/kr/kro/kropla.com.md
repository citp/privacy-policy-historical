# Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy over the Internet is important.  This site respects your privacy, and this policy statement explains the specifics of this site's practices.

This site no longer allows the input of e-mail addresses for update notification.  Any e-mail addresses gathered before this change in policy will be respected, and not shared with other entities or individuals. We regret we are no longer able to provide e-mail notification of updates.  However, this is due to a combination of factors, from changing anti-spam laws in many jurisdictions to the proliferation of e-mail viruses.

Persons submitting reports of updates and corrections to the site are requested to give their e-mail addresses should there be a need for clarification or follow-up.  This is optional, and once the relevant comments have been addressed, these addresses are discarded.  No information is collected, and "cookies" are not used here.  In short, any information provided by visitors is kept confidential and not shared with anyone for marketing or any other purposes.

This site features a number of links to external sites.  These are reviewed for appropriate content before the links are established.  However, SMK Enterprises cannot control the visitor information these sites may collect, nor is it responsible for their continued performance or any changes to content.  If you are concerned about privacy on those sites, please review their privacy policy or contact their webmaster.

We appreciate your interest in this site, and hope that you will continue to find it useful.
