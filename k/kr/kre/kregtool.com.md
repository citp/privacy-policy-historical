We respect your right to privacy. We do not collect personally identifiable information (for example your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) about you from the Site unless you voluntarily provide it to us. During your visit to the Site, we will collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your usage of the Site.

We will only collect personal information, which will be limited to your name, e-mail and address if you choose to enter that information. 

**Information Shared with Third Parties**

Unless otherwise stated at the time of collection, we do not generally sell or disclose personally identifiable information provided to us to any third parties (other than business partners of the Company and third party vendors retained by the Company). There are exceptions to this policy, such as: (a) you specifically authorize the disclosure or (b) disclosure is necessary to provide service to you or (c) disclosure is required by law or (d) disclosure is required for the safety of others. We may also use this information to protect our customers, employees or property – for instance, to investigate fraud, harassment or other types of unlawful service activities involving the Company or other companies that we do business with. Please be aware that when you provide personally identifiable information to us in connection with a transaction or event that we sponsor with a third party, you may also be providing that information to the third party. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of the third party. We may share non-personally identifiable information with business partners and other third parties to evaluate or enhance the Site. Such information may include, for example, the number of visitors to the Site and the specific pages visited. Non-personally identifiable information may also be disclosed if it is required by law or for the safety of others. 

**Links to Third Party Sites**

Our Site includes links to or frames of Web sites of third parties. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices employed by third party Web sites. Other Web sites may have different privacy policies or no privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policies of any Web site before providing personal information. You should note that we may host Web site advertising that is linked to the Site. If you provide any personally identifiable information while visiting any Web site advertising that is hosted by us, you will also be providing the personally identifiable information to the advertiser. If you provide any personally identifiable information while visiting any third party Web site that is linked from or framed by the Site, you will be providing the personally identifiable information to the third party owner of that site. Please note that we may share non-personally identifiable information collected from any Web site advertising we host on behalf of an advertiser with third parties in order to complete a transaction that you initiated, provide you services or evaluate the hosted Web site. 

**Opting Out Questions About the Policy   **

If you do not want us to contact you via e-mail, you can remove your name from our e-mail solicitation lists by contacting webmaster@kregtool.com. All concerns or questions about your privacy related to online advertising should be addressed through our Privacy Policy administration, which can also be reached by contacting webmaster@kregtool.com. 

**Communications with Users of the Site   **

We may contact you and our customers by telephone, direct mail or e-mail to conduct online surveys, provide information on new products and services, or inform you of special promotions. If you receive an e-mail from us that you do not wish to receive, you may contact webmaster@kregtool.com and ask us to remove you from our list. Please note that if you do remove yourself from our e-mail list, some e-mail messages may still come to you, although not those dealing with commercial solicitations. For example, we may e-mail you about viruses, or changes to your service, or other types of product advisories. 

**Cookies**

We may use “ cookies” to collect IP addresses and information regarding your usage of the Site. A cookie is a small file that is stored on the hard drive of your computer that is available for future access when you return to the Site. We use cookies to monitor your online activity and provide better service to you.

Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, please note that some Web sites may be able to track your usage after cookie deletion if you come back to the same site or a related site and provide personal information. 

**Security**

We are committed to protecting the security of our user’ s personal information, including when it is transmitted online. We have information systems that collect and store customer information, in addition to systems that store our own business records. These systems have different types of security as appropriate for the information stored. Our databases and systems are maintained to reasonably secure the Company’ s commercial information, including information about its customers. 

**Children**

We recognize the importance of the safety and privacy of children on the Internet. Due to these issues and in order to comply with certain laws, we do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. It is important for parents to supervise and prevent access to inappropriate content, e-mail or chat sessions. Children should ask their parents or guardians for permission before disclosing any information on the Site.

**Contests**

We may offer contests for which we may collect personal information (such as name, age, city and state). If you participate in the contest or send us a question we may also ask for an e-mail address. If we know a visitor is under the age of 13, we will require the child give us a parent or guardian e-mail address, so that we can tell the parent or guardian that the child is registered in a contest. If we need more than an e-mail address and first name for the child to participate in the contest, we will notify the parent or guardian, explain what information we need and why we need it, and generally ask that the parent or guardian (not child) provide it. Any information the parent or guardian (or child) gives us in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our database once the contest or program is complete, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete. No one will be excluded from the Site for not giving us this information.

**Privacy Policy Updates**

We may amend this privacy policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes to this policy, we will make an announcement on the Site.
