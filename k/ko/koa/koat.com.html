     This site collects no personally identifying information about
     individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such
     individuals.  In addition, we may place a "cookie" in the browser
     files of a user's computer.  The cookie itself does not contain any
     personally identifying information although it will enable us to
     relate a user's use of our sites to information that the user has
     specifically and knowingly provided to us.<p>

     A user's personally identifying information may be used for editorial
     purposes and we may also use such information for marketing and
     promotional purposes and may share the information with others if the
     user has not advised us of his or her preference not to be included in
     such an exchange.  Individuals always have the ability to stop their
     information being used for such purposes by sending an e-mail request
     to us at the address given above.</p><p>

     While we will seek to require third parties with whom we have
     agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any
     responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties.</p><p>

     Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal
     information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards
     or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by
     others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or
     parties.</p><p>
