### U.S. - EU Safe Harbor Framework

Kount, Inc.(Kount) recognizes that the European Union (EU) has a data protection regime enacted by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament ("Directive"). The Directive governs the transfer of personal data about individuals in the EU to the United States (US). Personal data is defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of such person. Transfer of such personal data from the EU to the US is restricted unless there is "adequate protection" for such information when it is received in the United States. To address the restrictions in the Directive, Kount adheres to the EU Safe Harbor Privacy framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework published by the US Department of Commerce ("Safe Harbor") . Those principles include Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Access and Accuracy, Security, and Oversight/Enforcement. A description of the Safe Harbor principles can be found at [ https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=26413](https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=26413)

Frequently asked question with regard to the Safe Harbor can be located [here](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018493.asp).

Kount is a "processor" of personal data as defined in Article 2 (e) of the Directive. Kount provides processing services in the US for its European Union business partners (EU Business Partners) which include merchants and financial institutions. Kount also provides processing for US based business partners. We act as a data processor and data importer on behalf of our EU Business Partners, and accordingly we follow the instructions provided by each EU Business Partner with regard to the collection, processing and protection of personal data provided to us by each such EU Business Partner. Each EU Business Partner acts as the data controller and data exporter for any personal data within its control. Residents in the EU should contact the applicable EU Business Partner with questions regarding the collection of their personal data.

Because Kount’s processing of the data relates to "the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences," it may be exempt from portions of the Directive. More details regarding this exemption are available at this link under Article 13, Section 1 (d).

917 S. Lusk Suite 301  
Boise ID 83706  


Kount has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU [and EU-Swiss] Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
