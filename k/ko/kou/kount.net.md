### Privacy Shield Framework 

Kount complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. Kount has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

Kount is a "processor" of personal data as defined in Article 2(e) of the Directive. Kount provides processing services in the US for its European Union and Swiss business partners (“Business Partners”) which include merchants and financial institutions and other applicable businesses. Kount also provides processing for US based business partners. We act as a data processor and data importer on behalf of our Business Partners, and accordingly we follow the instructions provided by each Business Partner with regard to the collection, processing and protection of personal data provided to us by each such Business Partner. Each Business Partner acts as the data controller and data exporter for any personal data within its control. Residents in the EU or Switzerland should contact the applicable Business Partner with questions regarding the collection of their personal data.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles (“the Principles”), Kount commits to resolve questions and complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy and/or the types of data Kount collects, please contact Kount at [privacy@kount.com](mailto:privacy@kount.com). Please note that Kount acts as a data processor and the majority of the data Kount processes is anonymous. In instances of onward transfers, Kount has the responsibility for processing personal information that is not anonymized in accordance with the Principles and subsequent transfers to third parties that may act on Kount’s behalf. Kount will remain liable under the Principles if its third party agents process such non-anonymized personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles. Any personal information that Kount collects that is not anonymous is available for European Union and Swiss individuals to access upon request for correction or deletion.

Written correspondence may be sent to:

> Privacy Shield Mailbox

Kount has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/](http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/) for more information and to file a complaint. As a last resort, and in limited situations, European Union and Swiss individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism. Kount is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
