PLEASE NOTE:

These companies use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or other technologies to collect information about the effectiveness of their advertisements and the types of ads that would be of greatest interest to you. These tools allow them to track some data relating to your computer and your internet browsing on Kodak sites or other sites that participate in their networks. This data includes your computer's IP Address, the website addresses visited, the browser type used, the computer's operating system, and the date, time and duration of the visit to each page.

**Google Analytics™:**  Kodak.com uses Google Analytics, a third-party web analysis service provided by Google Inc. ('Google'). Google Analytics uses "performance cookies" to analyze how you use the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. This website uses Google Analytics with the expansion '_anonymizeIp()'; therefore, only abbreviated IP addresses will be further processed, so that a direct connection to the individual user is eliminated. Your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states of the Treaty on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google Server in the USA and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the website operator for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity, and providing other services to website operators relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google will not associate the IP address transmitted under Google Analytics by your browser with other data held by Google. You may prevent the use of Google Analytics by disabling cookies in the browser's set up screen. You may prevent the storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser software; however, we must advise you that in this case, you might not be able to use all functions of this website to the full extent. You may prevent Google from recording the data generated by the cookie and pertaining to your use of the website (including your IP address), or processing these data by downloading and installing the following browser plug-in available through Google at the following link:  <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en> Google's Privacy Notice can be located at  <http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html>

**Web Beacons:**  We also place small "tracker gifs" or "beacons" on many of the pages on our website, in online advertising with third parties, and in our e-mail. We use these beacons, in connection with cookies, to collect non-personal data on the usage of our site including but not limited to the date and time of the visit, the pages visited, the referring web page, the type of browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc..), the type of operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, or Mac), and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g., AOL). This information is collected about thousands of site visits and analyzed as a whole. This information is useful in, for example, tracking the performance of our online advertising such as online banner ads and to determine where to place future advertising on other web sites.

**Disabling Cookies and beacons; Do Not Track:**  If you are uncomfortable with the collection of such information through the use of cookies and beacons, we recommend disabling these features through your browser preferences, though please understand this will limit the performance and functionality of Kodak's Web site. Your browser documentation should provide specific procedures for disabling cookie and beacon support.

Many web browsers allow you to use a "Do Not Track" function to inform websites and ad networks that you do not want your online activities tracked. Although our websites currently do not have a mechanism to recognize the various web browser "Do Not Track" signals, we do offer our customers choices to manage their marketing communications preferences via the unsubscribe functions in our emails. For more information browser tracking signals and Do Not Track please visit  <http://www.allaboutdnt.org/>
