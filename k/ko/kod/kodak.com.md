Kodak reserves the right to transfer your personal information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets. If the business is sold or transferred, Kodak will give you an opportunity to tell us not to transfer your personal information.

Kodak may send you e-mail about your orders or your account and in response to your questions. Kodak and its subsidiaries may also send you e-mail with information and/or special offers about products and services that may be of interest to you, unless you indicate you do not want to receive them. 

We will give you an opportunity to let us know your preference regarding the receiving of promotional e-mail when you register for a service, when you provide us with your personal information, or when we send you e-mail. If you choose not to accept this promotional e-mail, you may not receive special offers that may be of value to you.

Protecting Your Information 

Kodak implements a variety of administrative, managerial, and technical security measures to help protect your personal information. Kodak has Internal Control Standards which relate specifically to the handling of personal information. These include certain controls to help safeguard the information we collect online. 

Kodak employees are trained to understand and comply with these controls and we communicate our privacy policy, practices and guidelines to our employees. However, while we strive to protect your personal information, you must also take steps to protect your information. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal information while you are on the Internet. 

Communities 

Some of our sites may enable you to participate in public services such as discussion boards, chats, and live events. Please use discretion when posting personal information about yourself when using these services. Be aware that when you disclose personal information at these sites, such as your name, member name, e-mail address, etc., the information may be collected and used by others to send unsolicited e-mail. The services are open to the public, and what you post there can be seen by anyone and is not protected. Kodak cannot control the comments that you may receive while you participate in these services. You may find other people's comments to be offensive, harmful or inaccurate. 

Children's Privacy 

Protecting the online privacy of children is especially important, and those under the age of 13 are protected by federal law. For that reason, Kodak does not knowingly permit children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites, or to buy goods and services on our sites, without verifiable parental consent. Kodak does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13, except with their parent's express consent. 

If we ever include children under the age of 13 as part of our intended site audience, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice; and we will provide processes to obtain parental approval, provide access to information and allow parents to request removal of their children's personal information. 

Kodak encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to participate in their interactive activities and interests. 

Outside Links 

Some Kodak Web sites contain links to and from other Web sites and Kodak is not responsible for the privacy practices of those Web sites. Kodak encourages you to ascertain the privacy practices of those Web sites.
