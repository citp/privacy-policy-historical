IP addresses and other such information  _are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable._

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

Our website does  _not  _use cookies. You can also see out [Terms of Use](http://koolmobile.net/terms-of-use/).

**Advertising**

This website is partially funded through our generous sponsors and advertisers. We use as little advertising as we can, and — when it’s necessary —  _only_  to cover our hosting and maintenance expenses. We avoid advertising programs with any privacy risks.  In fact, we avoid advertising, period.
