  * [What personal information do we collect from  
you and how? ]()
    * THE OUTNET collects personal information in several ways when you place an order or register for a service offered by THE OUTNET. By registering, you are consenting to the collection of your personal data. If an order is placed with us, we need to hold personal information including your name, email address, phone numbers, home address, shipping and credit card billing address(es) so that we can process and fulfil your order. We also collect and record the card details of registered customers to make shopping at THE OUTNET even quicker. Saved card details will never be shared with third parties and will only be used to process your order, using our payment partner's systems. More details on saved card details can be found in our FAQs. Additionally we may also obtain information as a result of authentication or identity checks. Sometimes we may ask for your telephone number. This number may be given to our courier for delivery services. These details allow us to process your order and to let you know the status of your order.

In addition, our Live Chat provider stores all chat conversations for 13 months. These transcripts are only accessed by THE OUTNET for training purposes so we can enhance the service we provide. To receive a copy of your chat conversation simply request this when exiting Live Chat or contact our customer care team by emailing [customercare@theoutnet.com](mailto:customercare@theoutnet.com). Alternatively, you can call 0800 011 4250 (UK) or +44 330 022 4250 (from a mobile or internationally).
