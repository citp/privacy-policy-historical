# koodos.com - Privacy / security

  * ### What information do you collect and why?

When you register, purchase or correspond with Koodos, there may be different ways we gather information about you: 

    * When you register with us, we ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, delivery address, contact details and, if you place an order we keep a record of this information. We do this so that we can recognise you as a registered customer and to fulfill the orders you place with us.
    * We keep a record of any e-mail correspondence you send us so that we can better serve you.
    * In order to maintain the highest standards of customer service we record, we sometimes play back incoming calls in order to work on continuous refinement of our customer service and to aid in training.
    * We keep a record of your purchases so that we can communicate with you about any relevant offers that might interest you. It also means we can contact you about any problems with your order.
  * ### What are cookies? 

Cookies are small text files that web sites can send to your computer. They allow us to recognise and track users on our Site and assist us in providing our customers with a good online experience. Cookies enable us to store information about your use of our Site such as the areas you visit and the length of your stay.

  * ### Why do you use cookies?

Cookies make the interaction between users and web sites faster and easier. Without cookies, it would be very difficult for a web site to allow a visitor to fill up a shopping basket or to remember the user's preferences or registration details for a future visit. The koodos website uses cookies to allow customers to move from one part of the web site to another and to add items to the shopping basket without having to login repeatedly.

  * ### How do I delete cookies?

Information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at www.AboutCookies.org. Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our site.

  * ### What personal data do you share with third parties?

    * We will never pass on your email address on to a 3rd party for marketing purposes unless you have chosen ‘3rd party opt-in' as one of your communication preferences within My Account. We will, however send your details to merchants for whom you have indicated interest by purchasing products offered by them on koodos. 
    * We never pass on credit card details. 
    * We share data with agents (including credit reference agencies, credit card clearing agencies, fraud prevention and detection agencies) who process the orders you place with us or who provide services to you. In these instances, we provide them with only the information they need to perform their function. 
    * We may share data with outside research companies whom we may ask to contact you directly for your opinions in such areas as our customer service (in which case we provide them with only the information they need to perform their function). 
  * ### How do I unsubscribe?

If you do not wish to receive any further email messages from us please email unsubscribe@koodos. com. Please know that if you unsubscribe we will not be able to send you Private Sale alerts or information about upcoming offers or new arrivals.

  * ### What security procedures are in place to protect customers?

koodos online purchases take place in a safe environment using the latest security technology to protect our customers. 

We encrypt your credit card information to ensure your transactions with us are private and protected as they travel over the Internet. We accept orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - this means you cannot inadvertently place an order through an unsecured connection. 

Your payment details are held in an encrypted format until we process your order. This encryption makes it virtually impossible for unauthorised parties to read any information that you send us. The encryption technique we use is the highest standard available for websites.
