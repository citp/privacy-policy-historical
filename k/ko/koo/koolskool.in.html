<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Safe and Secure Shopping</span></h1>
<h2>Safety of credit card usage and data</h2>
<p>Shopping at KOOLSKOOL &nbsp;is 100% safe. Credit card payments, internet  banking and other payments are processed through the Axis Bank&nbsp; payment  gateway and CCAvenue.</p>
<p>Both our providers use the latest encryption technology to protect  your credit card information. It encrypts your credit card number so  that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.</p>
<p>Furthermore, both the providers ask you to enter the CVV (Credit  Verification Value) number on your credit card. This is a 3 digit number  which follows your credit card number and is given at the back of the  card to ensure that the person entering the card number has the physical  plastic card with him/her. In addition to this both Mastercard and Visa  have their own verification process which is integrated with our  payment mechanism.</p>
<p>You can be assured that KOOLSKOOL offers you the highest standards of  security currently available on the internet so as to ensure that your  shopping experience is private, safe and secure.</p>
<h2>Storage of Credit Card Information</h2>
<p>KOOLSKOOL does not collect or store your credit card/bank account  information at all. Axis Bank/CCAvenue authorizes the transaction  directly without any information passing through us.</p></div>                </div>
