<ul class="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Internal record keeping. </li>

</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Cookies</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your  computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file may be added and the  cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a  particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an  individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs,  likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your  preferences. From time to time, we may use traffic log cookies to  identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about  webpage traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to  customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis  purposes and then the data is removed from the system. We may also log  data to be able to help customize the web site to your personal  preferences. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website,  by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do  not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any  information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.  You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers  automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser  setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from  taking full advantage of the website.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Sharing of personal information</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may share personal information with our other corporate entities  and affiliates to: help detect and prevent identity theft, fraud and  other potentially illegal acts; correlate related or multiple accounts  to prevent abuse of our services; and to facilitate joint or co-branded  services that you request where such services are provided by more than  one corporate entity. Those entities and affiliates will not market to  you as a result of such sharing unless you explicitly choose to opt-in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or  in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to  respond to various kinds of&nbsp; legal process. We may disclose personal  information to law enforcement offices, third party rights owners, or  others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably  necessary to: enforce our Terms or Privacy Policy; respond to claims  that an advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a  third party; or protect the rights, property or personal safety of our  users or the general public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">KOOLSKOOL and its affiliates will share some or all of your personal  information with another business entity should we (or our assets) plan  to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a  transaction occur, that other business entity (or the new combined  entity) will be required to follow this privacy policy with respect to  your personal information.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Links to other websites</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our website may contain links to other  websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave  our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that  other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection  and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such  sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You  should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to  the website in question. Controlling your personal information <br> You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Whenever you are asked to fill in a form on the website, look for  the box that you can click to indicate that you do not want the  information to be used by anybody for direct marketing purposes </li>
<li>If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information  for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by  writing to or emailing us at the un-subscription email address given to  us in the contact page of our website. </li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Our commitment to children’s privacy</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Protecting the privacy of  the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never  collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually  know are under 13. Though our website is structured to attract those  under 13, our commitment to their privacy is total. Visitors to our  website who are under 13 may contact us for an appropriate reason  (should they need to), by writing to us directly using email. We do not  sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties  unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may use your personal information to send you promotional  information about third parties which we think you may find interesting  if you tell us that you wish this to happen. However, your information  will not be handed to third parties as mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you believe that any information we are holding on you is  incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as  possible, at the above address. We will promptly correct any information  found to be incorrect.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Advertisements on KOOLSKOOL</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may from time to time use third-party advertising companies to  serve advertisements when you visit our website. These companies may use  information (not including your name, address, email address, or  telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order  to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Safe and Secure Shopping</span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Safety of credit card usage and data</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shopping at KOOLSKOOL is 100% safe. Credit card payments, internet  banking and other payments are processed through the Axis Bank&nbsp; payment  gateway and CCAvenue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both our providers use the latest encryption technology to protect  your credit card information. It encrypts your credit card number so  that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, both the providers ask you to enter the CVV (Credit  Verification Value) number on your credit card. This is a 3 digit number  which follows your credit card number and is given at the back of the  card to ensure that the person entering the card number has the physical  plastic card with him/her. In addition to this both Mastercard and Visa  have their own verification process which is integrated with our  payment mechanism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can be assured that KOOLSKOOL offers you the highest standards of  security currently available on the internet so as to ensure that your  shopping experience is private, safe and secure.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Storage of Credit Card Information</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">KOOLSKOOL does not collect or store your credit card/bank account  information at all. Axis Bank/CCAvenue authorizes the transaction  directly without any information passing through us.</p></div>					</div>
