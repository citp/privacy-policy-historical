## 1\. What Information We Collect

When you access, connect to, sign up to, participate in, create an account for, make purchases within or otherwise use our Services, we may collect personal data from you. The personal data we collect will depend on the circumstances and the Services you are using. We collect information in two ways – (A) information that YOU provide and (B) information that we automatically collect.

  1. **Information You Provide** You provide certain personally identifiable information that uniquely identifies you such as:

    * Email address when you choose to participate in various activities on the Platform such as registering an account, chat, posting messages in the games comment section or in our forums, sending feedback, entering contests, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists;
    * User name and password to protect your account;
    * Information requested by us when you report a problem with our Services;
    * Your contact information if you reach out to us;
    * Postal address and limited and tokenized payment information may be collected when uploading a game, or making a purchase; and/or
    * Other information to us directly or through third-party services.

**You may also provide us information in the following manners:**

    * **Information You Provide via Apps.** You may have the option to link your mobile account to your Sites account in connection with certain Apps. This will allow you to participate in content that crosses between the Sites and Apps, such as Kongregate level, points, and badges. If you choose this linking option, the information we receive via the Sites may also apply to Apps, and vice versa.

    * **Your Friends.** You may invite friends to join the Kongregate community by using the “invite a friend” feature. You will be required to submit your name and email address, as well as their name and email address. Your friend’s personal information that you submit in this feature will be used only to send the email you request, and will not be otherwise stored or maintained by Kongregate. You may also identify certain people as “friends” under your Kongregate account; this list is publicly visible to all, whether or not the user has a Kongregate account.

    * **Information through Social Media.** Personal information that you post voluntarily now or in the future through the Platform or on an area of a social network monitored by us (e.g., our Facebook page) may be visible to others and collected by third-parties. Information that you disclose, including, but not limited to, through our online chat rooms, forums, game comments, profile shouts and direct messages is public and will be accessible to anyone who uses our Platform and/or 3rd Party Platform Games.

    * **Payment Information.** If you make a purchase in or through our Services, our third-party payment processor will collect the billing and financial information it needs to process your charges. Kongregate does not collect or store your financial information, but our payment processors may share information with us in order for us to fulfill your order. Our User Agreement explains our policies and terms relevant to our charges, billing practices, third-party credits and virtual currencies.

    * **Customer Support Communication.** Except as provided herein, when you ask for help from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store the contact information you give them (generally, your name and e-mail address), information about your game play or activity on our Services, and your Kongregate username and/or social network ID number. We will also store the communications you have with the Customer Support team in order to provide you support and improve the Services.

    * **Other Information You Provide.** We collect the following types of personally identifiable information: your contact information (such as name, postal or email address, or phone number), username and password, purchase history on our Platform, game play preferences (such as an interest in a particular type of game or genre), information you provide by interacting with us through social media, and photographs that you submit on our Platform or through our social media channels. By submitting a photograph, you waive any rights thereto and authorize us to copyright, use and publish the same in print or electronically for any lawful purpose.

  2. **Information We Automatically Collect.** We and our affiliates, analytics or service providers, and third party companies with whom we have marketing relationships, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual or aggregated basis.

    * **Analytics.** When you visit our Platform, we automatically collect the following types of information: information about the devices you use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser, and operating system type), URLs that refer you to our Platform and the dates and times of your visits, information on your gaming behavior on our Platform (e.g., page views, paths you take through our Sites, frequency of visits, referring/exit pages), general geographic location information (e.g., country) that shows where you are when browsing our Sites, search terms that you enter to reach our Sites or enter on our Sites to find products, and the fact that you opened one of our emails. We utilize analytics services to help us track the efficacy of our Platform and help us learn more about our users’ behavior.

    * **Information We Receive through Apps.** If you play a Kongregate game through an App on a mobile device (such as your phone or tablet), we can collect mobile device identifiers that can include things like your MAC address and IP address. We may also collect information such as device name and type, operating system, country, and any other information you choose to provide such as your game character name or e-mail address. Additionally, we may access third party information such as your phone or Facebook contacts with your authorization and according to the rules you have established within your device permissions.

    * **Social Media Features.** Our Platform includes social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets, the “share this” widget, or interactive mini-programs that run on our Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.

    * **Facebook Link.** To personalize the Site, and to simplify the registration process, we give you the option to link your account with Facebook. When you link your account, Facebook may share data about you with us, and we may share information about you with Facebook. In addition, Kongregate users who are your friends on Facebook will be shown your Kongregate username if you have both linked your Facebook accounts.

    * **Information We Receive from Third Parties.** As previously noted, you can play Kongregate games through third party consoles or third party social media sites such as Facebook. When you play these 3rd Party Platform Games, backend system vendors may collect and share your information with us such as player IDs, session information, and purchase data, as well as personal information including email address, gender, and birthday and/or age range. Because such services are offered through a third party, this collection of information is governed the applicable third party’s privacy policy.

    * **Tailored Advertising.** Advertising allows us to provide many free-to-play Services. Third-party advertising companies serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. Such advertising partners have a legitimate interest to collect and profile personal data in the form of IP address and cookie ID from users on our website in order to provide targeted online advertising and ad measurement.

    * **Cookies.** As further described in our Cookie Policy, we automatically collect information through cookies and other similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, ad tags and device identifiers) to recognize you and/or your device(s). Cookies are small text files stored by your Web browser on your computer, phone, tablet, or other device used to browse our Platform. Cookies allow us to identify and authenticate visitors, track behavior, and enable important site features. We also contract with analytics services and third-party advertising companies to collect similar information for specific purposes. **_Please note that companies delivering advertisements on our Services may also use cookies or other technologies as described below in the section “Third Party Advertisers” and those practices are subject to those companies’ own policies._** You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. For more information on cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.

  3. **Is it mandatory for you to provide your personal data?** Personal data that we request and is marked “mandatory” in any way, for example by using the * symbol, is required in order for us to provide our Services (for statutory, contractual, administrative, technical or similar reasons).

## 3\. With Whom We Share Your Personal Data

Unless we tell you first (such as at the time we collect information from you), or unless it is part of a specific program or feature in which you have elected to participate, we do not rent or sell personally identifiable information to others. We do not share email addresses with third parties for the purpose of sending their own emails to you without your consent. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, then you can either contact us at support@kongregate.com or opt-out. To opt-out, please see **“Your Rights and Options”** below.

We may share information we collect with our third party business partners, advertising companies, and other third parties or allow third parties to collect this information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy:

  * **Service Providers.** We may use third party service providers to perform services for us such as to provide the infrastructure and IT services (including but not limited to data storage), process credit and debit card transactions, to provide customer services, collecting debt analysis and improve data and process customer inquiries and perform other statistical analyzes. In the performance of these services, the third party vendors may have access to your personal data but is only authorized to process it strictly on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.

  * **Third Party Advertisers.** We have advertising on our Services so we can offer continue to offer many of our Services for free. Our advertising partners may have access to our personal data but you may opt-out as described in **“Your Rights and Options”** below and the Cookie Policy. We may also use aggregate information to monitor usage of our Services in order to help us improve and develop our Services, and we may provide such aggregate information to third parties, e.g., content partners or advertisers. This aggregate information does not include personal data and cannot be linked to you. When advertisers or ad networks place ads in our Services, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our Services:

    * Performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);
    * Aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (like players between the ages of 21 and 25 who live San Francisco);
    * Certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as IDFAs, and de-identified persistent device identifiers such as a hashed Android ID);
    * Your social network ID;
    * And other contextual data about your game play (for example, your level and session length).

The information collected may be used to:

    * Measure how effective ads are, to offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements for products and services that are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as behavioral advertising), and/or
    * Undertake web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics which is used to analyze traffic and other player activity to improve your experience).

Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons. After clicking on a third party advertisement, you may no longer be on our Platform. The third party sites are operated by companies that are outside of our control, and your activities at those sites will be governed by the policies and practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of these third parties before disclosing any personally identifiable information, as we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.

    * **Offer Walls.** Our Services may display an “offer wall” that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third-party advertisers to provide virtual currency to players in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. After clicking on one of these offers, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Kongregate or the social network through which you are playing Kongregate games. To properly credit player accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your Kongregate user name/ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider.

    * **3rd Party Platform Games.** If you play 3rd Party Platform Games through platforms or sites operated by a third party, including social media sites such as Facebook, your social media “friends,” other players, or other types of connections may, depending on your social media privacy settings, be able to: see certain personal information about you; view your game activity; and/or communicate with you or send you “friend” or other connection requests through the social media service.

    * **3rd Party Developers.** Most of the games on our Platforms are created by 3rd party developers. These 3rd party developers may request, by using Kongregate’s SDK and APIs, certain publicly visible information about users that play their games, e.g., your username, your user_id (a numeric ID associated with your account that persists even if a username is changed), list of your Kongregate friends (usernames and user_ids). If you wish to reduce the availability or visibility of such information, you may change your profile settings to “Private” in your account options. This will prevent others, including 3rd party developers, from being able to see or access your friends list as well as other information you have shared on your profile page.

    * **Third Parties for Security or Other Legitimate Reasons.** We may also disclose your personal data to third parties, if we reasonably believe that disclosure of such personal data is necessary:

      * To comply with valid legal obligations including subpoenas, court orders, governmental requests or search warrants, and as otherwise authorized by law;
      * To protect our rights, property, or the safety of our customers, employees or the general public;
      * To protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of our Services and to protect our network, services, devices and users from such use;
      * To advance or defend against complaints or legal claims;
      * To determine credit risk, for reporting purposes or to obtain payment for our Services;
      * To outside auditors and regulators.
    * **Intra-Group Transfers.** We may disclose your personal data to other companies within our parent company if it is necessary for administrative purposes or the provision of our Services to you. If you have agreed thereto, we may also disclose your personal data to affiliate companies owned or operated by our parent company for marketing purposes. The affiliate companies who may have access to your personal data follow practices consistent with this Privacy Policy.

    * **Corporate Transaction, Reorganization or Bankruptcy.** In the event of a change of control, sale of some or all of our business or assets, corporate reorganization or bankruptcy, we would share the pertinent customer information (which may include your personal information) with the other business entity (or entities) involved in the transaction. In such an event, we would notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Platform of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

    * **Legal Compliance.** We may disclose information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required by law to do so. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection, legal compliance or investigations. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.

With respect to onward transfers, we remain liable should the third parties to whom we transfer personal data process such information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles.




With respect to onward transfers, we remain liable should the third parties to whom we transfer personal data process such information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles.

## 4\. How Long We Retain Your Personal Data

We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide our Services to you and fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We do periodic status checks to review when personal data needs to be deleted. However, as we process your personal data for various purposes, the actual period for which the personal data will be stored will depend on the circumstances. For example, we may retain some information for a few years after you have closed your account with us if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend or establish legal rights. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we cannot identify you.

## 5\. How We Protect Your Information

We strive to maintain the security of your personal information through a variety of security measures. Safeguarding your personal data is a priority for us. Personal data that you provide to us is stored on secure servers, and we use rigorous procedures to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data. Although we work hard to protect your personal data, please note that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal data, and we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to any login or password information, and to your computer or device. To minimize the risk of having your account being compromised, we recommend that you set up your account password using unique numbers, letters and special characters. Do not disclose passwords to others. Please notify us of any password compromises and change passwords periodically to maintain account protection. To learn more about how to protect yourself online, we encourage you to visit the government’s website at www.onguardonline.gov

    * In the case of Android devices: Open the settings in your App list and tap on the “Ad” button. When the Ad window has opened, you can deactivate the Google Advertising ID.

  * **Opting Out of Third Party Tailored Advertising.** If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored web and mobile web advertising you may visit the following websites:

    * Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising; and

    * Your Online Choices UK website for EU-based advertising.

    * In addition, if you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in apps on your mobile device, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device. You can also reset the “Advertising Identifier” (like an IDFA) from your mobile device’s “settings” page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous “Advertising Identifier.”

    * Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AppChoices” app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for tailored advertising.

Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. While you do have choices to limit personalized ads that are tailored to your interests, you may receive generic ads. These opt-out tools are not provided by Kongregate but provided by third parties.

The third party analytics companies we work with may collect and store data related to our website, enabling the creation of user profiles under pseudonyms. These user profiles serve to analyze visitor behavior and are evaluated in order to improve and design our offer so as to meet the demands. Their collection and use of information is subject to their own privacy policies. You may opt-out of Google Analytics by following this link.

  * **Controlling Cookies.** In order to design our Services in the most user-friendly manner for you, we, as well as many other companies, also use persistent and session cookies and web beacons and other similar technologies.

  * **Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions.** From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests, sweepstakes, surveys and/or other promotions on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you as provided in the terms of the corresponding promotion. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; in those cases, that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

  * **California Privacy Rights.** California Civil Code Section 1798 allows California residents to ask companies with whom they have an established business relationship to provide certain information about the companies’ sharing of personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. California customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices may contact us at support@Kongregate.com or by writing to the address provided under **“Questions or Concerns”** below.

  * **Do Not Track.** Do Not Track is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies such as ours should interpret Do Not Track signals. Kongregate does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device. You can learn more about Do Not Track here.
