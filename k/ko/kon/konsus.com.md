#### California Privacy Disclosures

Konsus does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from Konsus unless you provide it to them directly.

#### Information Sharing

When you submit information to Konsus, it is collected, processed and maintained solely by us or by third party Agents who are bound by confidentiality obligations. We may share or otherwise use aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information. Konsus reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both private and public areas of this website at our discretion, if required by law or if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary in order to prevent harm to our Site or our Users or to protect the rights of our Users, the general public, or Konsus, to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.

#### Log Data

When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data ”).

#### Cookies

Like many websites, we use ”Cookies”, a small data file that we transfer to your computerʼs hard disk for record-keeping purposes, to collect information. We use Cookies for two purposes.

Second, we utilize session ID Cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Konsus Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept Cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site.

We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.

We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Konsus or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
