**How Does Kontera Value Online Privacy**   
Online privacy is very important to us and to our business. Therefore, Kontera adheres to the following strict guidelines to protect your online privacy: 

  * Kontera will NOT collect any personally-identifiable information about you except for information that you voluntarily provide through the contact us or feedback forms.

**The Type of Information Kontera Collects Through this Web Site and How is it Used**

**Personally-Identifiable Information**   
The only personally-identifiable information we collect is information that our visitors voluntarily provide to us when using our Web Site. For example, if you are an advertiser or web publisher and use our Web Site to request a contact from our sales or business development department, we will ask for your name, email address and other contact information so that a Kontera representative can respond to your inquiry. Consumers and partners can use our Web Site to request technical support or other information from Kontera or to comment about any aspect of our operations. We use the contact information they provide to respond to their inquiries. We will not sell or rent to third parties information you may choose to provide through our online information request forms or use such information for purposes unrelated to your request for information or comments. If you want to contact Kontera but do not wish to reveal information about yourself online, you can write to us at:   
Kontera Technologies, Inc.   
1550 Bryant St. Suite 975   
San Francisco, CA 94103 

**Browser Level Information and IP Addresses**   
Our Web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration when you visit our Web Site, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running and your IP address. Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by all computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. We use your IP address to deliver our Web pages to you on request. On occasion, we may also use your IP address for troubleshooting purposes to help diagnose problems with our server. The browser-level information we collect is stored in an anonymous form and is not linked to your personally-identifiable information. We use the browser level information we collect to make our Web Site as useful as we can for as many users as possible. 

**Cookies**   
A standard feature of browser software enables Web site publishers to place a small text file called a "cookie" on a visitor's hard drive. Our cookies don't reveal personal information; the only personal information a cookie can contain is information that you voluntarily supply. We use a cookie to remember the user name and login ID entered by advertisers and partners to access the external reporting system operated on a secure area of our Web Site. A cookie is inserted for this purpose only if the advertiser or partner has selected the "remember my password" feature when he or she entered a password and login ID. We also use a cookie to authenticate users' login information as they navigate the reporting system pages of our Web Site. We do not use cookies to collect any personally-identifiable information and we do not track any of your activity on the Internet outside of our Web Site. For example, we do not use cookies to track which Web sites our visitors come from when they enter our site or which sites they go to when they leave our site. 

**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

**Sales Inquiries**   
If you use our Web Site to request information about purchasing advertising services from Kontera, we may forward your inquiry and contact information to one of our third-party resellers if we believe that the reseller would be in the best position to assist you. Our resellers are not authorized to use your contact information for any reason other than to respond to your request for information about Kontera's services. 

**Service Providers**   
From time to time, Kontera may contract with third-party service providers to help us operate our site, conduct other aspects of our business, or improve the services that we provide to you. Some of these service providers may be given access to personally-identifiable information collected through this Web Site, but only if we deem such access to be necessary to perform the services that we request. In these circumstances, we will require our service providers to commit that they will not use the personally identifiable information they receive from Kontera for any purposes other than those dictated by us. 

**Other Disclosures**   
We reserve the right to release any information about our visitors when we form a good faith belief that such a release is necessary to comply with the law, subpoenas or other valid legal process, to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, to report or collect debts owed, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Kontera, our Web Site visitors, or others. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event that Kontera or substantially all of our assets are acquired by another company, the information that we collect from our Web Site visitors may be included among the transferred assets. 

**Security of Personally-Identifiable Information**   
We have taken careful measures to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of any personally identifiable information collected through this Web Site. Information gathered by Kontera through our Web Site is stored within Kontera-controlled databases on servers maintained in protected environments. However, no physical or electronic security system is perfect and we therefore cannot guarantee the security of our servers or databases or guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. 

**Reviewing, Updating and Deleting Your Information**

If you provide any personally identifiable information to us through this Web Site, you will have the opportunity to review, update, or delete your information at any time (except, of course, with respect to information that we do not store). To exercise these choices, please email your request or instructions through our [contact us form](https://web.archive.org/web/20051219085305id_/http%3A//www.kontera.com/contact.asp). 

**Protecting the Privacy of Children**   
Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers) over the Internet, to Kontera or to anyone else. Our Web Site is not directed to children under the age of 13 and Kontera will not knowingly collect personally-identifying information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please don't provide any information about yourself while visiting this Web Site. 

**Notification of Changes to This Privacy Policy**   
Kontera reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time. If Kontera chooses to make material changes in the future, we will post a notice of these changes on our Web Site. If the changes include the addition of rights to use or disclose previously-collected personally-identifiable information in a manner that was not described in this privacy policy at the time of collection through this Web Site, we will notify you using the email address or other contact information you have provided. In these circumstances, you will have an opportunity to delete your information or otherwise exercise a choice as to whether we use or disclose your information in this different manner. By using our Web Site, you agree that your visit and any dispute over privacy is governed by this Privacy Policy. 

**Links to other Sites**   
Our Web Site may contain links to other sites operated by third parties. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content of those sites or for the privacy practices of their operators. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each site that collects information from you. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by Kontera on our Web Site, [http://www.Kontera.com](http://www.kontera.com/)
