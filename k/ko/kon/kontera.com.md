  * Kontera discloses automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Site. 


  * Kontera works with some authorized service providers to provide website hosting and maintenance as well as other services for us.  Kontera requires these services providers to safeguard personally identifiable information you provide to us. To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their contractual obligations to Kontera, these third parties may have access to or process your personally identifiable information. Kontera generally limits their use of your personally identifiable information to the purpose for which it was shared. 


  * Kontera may also disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant.  In some cases, we may make such disclosures without first providing notice to Users.
