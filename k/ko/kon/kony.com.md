**General principles**

Kony respects your privacy and seeks to protect your data. We hope that the information in this policy will show you how we gather, use, and protect your personal data.  We aim to ensure that the processing of personal data by or on behalf of Kony is fair and reasonable and that your personal data is secure, accurate, and up to date.

Because Kony PAAS and its services are online, as a result they are international; hence personal data may be made available internationally, including in countries that do not have data protection laws or laws that provide equivalent protection to European or North American rules.

**What information Kony collects, and why we collect it**

Kony collects information about our users and other individuals it deals with in its day-to-day business. This information includes contact and registration information, information about the way registered users use our services, as well as details of individuals' interests. It is used for administration and to support, improve, and obtain feedback on Kony products, and to prevent and detect breaches of security, the law, or our contract terms.

In addition, Kony may ask for information about your business, including but not limited to information such as industry, business model, or company address details.

Where allowed by law, Kony may collate information about individuals and businesses that it receives from others with the information we obtain directly. The information described above may be retained and used by Kony after an individual or business ceases to use Kony’s services or the individual has ceased dealing with us.

Kony will also use all this information to assess what Kony products and services may be of interest to individuals and to personalize the service(s) we provide. If you are registered to use a service, Kony may contact you to obtain feedback on that service and any improvements we could make to it.

The law often allows you to write and ask to see and correct the information held about you, sometimes on payment of a fee.

However, no internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free.
