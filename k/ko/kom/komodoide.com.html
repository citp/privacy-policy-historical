<p>ActiveState is committed to respecting your right to privacy while using our site. This Privacy Policy contains information regarding our privacy practices for the entire ActiveState site (including <a title="ActiveState" href="http://www.activestate.com" target="_blank">www.activestate.com</a> and <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com" target="_blank">aspn.activestate.com</a>).</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>ActiveState is the sole owner of the customer information collected on this site. We will not share this information in any ways other than those disclosed in this statement. ActiveState collects information from our users at several points on our website.</p>

<h2>Information Requests</h2>

<p>Throughout our site, you are provided with the opportunity to contact us via email to ask questions, request information and materials, register for online presentations, or provide comments and suggestions. You may also be offered the opportunity to have one of our representatives contact you to provide information about our products or services. We may request additional personal information from you, such as your name and telephone number, to help us satisfy your request.</p>

<h2>Online Forms with Mollom</h2>

<p>ActiveState uses Mollom for online form processing.</p>

<p>This privacy policy explains how Mollom BVBA processes your personal data. Please read it carefully, as it specifies which rights you have and how you can exercise your rights.</p>

<p>_Mollom web service _– Mollom operates a web service that tries to determine the quality of messages posted to a website, and particularly tries to determine whether these messages are to be considered as unsolicited messages (also called “spam”). Nowadays, websites that allow visitors to contribute or post comments (such as blogs, discussion forums, wikis, etc.) are flooded with inappropriate commercial messages that are distracting for all visitors, and are sometimes even highly illegal. These commercial messages are often uploaded in an automatic way. Mollom’s service screens messages before they are posted to the website.</p>

<p><em>How Mollom works</em> – When you post a message on a website that uses Mollom service (called “the website” in the remainder of this text), the website’s server will first send your message – as well as some information about your identity (such as your IP address, name or nickname, e-mail address and OpenID) – to Molloms server. Molloms server will then compare your message and your identity details with all elements in our database, and perform several complex statistical computations in order to assess the quality of your message (e.g., spam, abuse, etc.).</p>

<p>If Molloms server then determines that the content of your message is of insufficient quality or constitutes spam or abuse, it will inform the website thereof. The website server may then decide to reject your message, or to provide you with an additional question to find out whether you are in fact a human being, and not a machine trying to send out as much commercial communications as possible. Please note that it is sometimes possible that our server wrongfully determines the actual quality of the content of your message, or wrongfully considers your message as spam or abuse.</p>

<p>_What Mollom stores about you _– Mollom stores all information provided to us by the website. This will include, in particular, the following personal data about you (to the extent effectively provided to us by the website): the content of your message, your name or nickname, IP address, user ID, OpenID, e-mail address, URL of your website, and the date and time you post a message.</p>

<p><em>How long Mollom stores this data</em> – Your data is stored in Molloms databases for at most two months. After this period of two months, Mollom can continue to store your data in anonymized way for a period of two years.</p>

<p><em>How Mollom uses your personal data</em> – Mollom uses your personal data to assess the quality of your message, and to find out whether your message constitutes spam, by comparing your data with all other data of all other users in our databases. Afterwards, Mollom also uses your personal data to make similar assessments for all other websites that use our service, as the more information we store in Molloms database, the better Mollom can assess whether a message is genuine.</p>

<p>While Mollom sometimes provide statistical information (trends, numbers, etc.) generated from our databases to third parties, please rest assured that you cannot be identified on the basis of this statistical information.</p>

<p><em>Note that Mollom hates spam as much as you do</em> – in fact, Mollom’s service is specifically targeted at removing spam. So, Mollom will never provide your email address to third parties, and Mollom will never send any spam themselves to you. In most cases, Mollom will not even be aware of your e-mail address.</p>

<p>Also note that Mollom can provide access to your personal data in case of illegal or abusive use, or in case we receive orders from a competent legal authority.</p>

<p><em>How Mollom protects you</em> – Mollom is bound by the strict rules of Belgian and European data protection legislation, which prevents them from making unlawful use of your personal data. Please note that the website’s operator may be bound by other rules, depending on his jurisdiction.</p>

<p><em>Your rights</em> – You have the right to gain access to, correct and/or remove all personal data we store about you on our servers. All this is provided to you free of charge. In order to exercise your rights, please <a href="http://mollom.com/contact" target="_blank">contact Mollom</a>.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s hard drive, containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie provides user benefits and is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. For example, by setting a cookie on our site, you would not have to enter your password more than once. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site, though some areas may be functionally limited. For example, you will not be able to take full advantage of our mailing list subscription tools. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the on-site experience.</p>

<h2>Information Collected</h2>

<p>We may collect information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”) when you contact us and participate in our surveys, webinars, download our whitepapers or participate in promotional activities on our website. Personal Information may include the following categories of information: Contact Data (such as your name, company, address, email address); and Demographic Data (such as zip code). If you communicate with us by email, post messages to any of our social media channels, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.</p>

<p>We have opted-in to The LeadLander Contact Network. LeadLander is a web analytics tool, similar to Google Analytics. However, The LeadLander Contact Network pools together contact information collected through any of our forms or email campaigns and any other LeadLander opted-in website forms or email campaigns to identify a visitor to the Site. Whenever a visitor goes to any LeadLander opted-in website, LeadLander can display the visitor by their name and email address in its reports to its subscribers.</p>

<p>We comply with the Federal Can-Spam Act (15 U.S.C. 7701 et seq.). We use your email only to communicate with you about products or services that may be of interest to you. You can opt out of receiving emails from us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@activestate.com">unsubscribe@activestate.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Log Files</h2>

<p>Our website servers generate standard traffic log files. We use these files to prepare aggregate traffic statistics for our site. There is no personally identifiable information in these log files. We use IP addresses and cookie values to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information to improve the performance of our site.</p>

<h2>Requested Services and Product Evaluations</h2>

<p>We communicate with our users to provide requested services, and in regard to issues relating to their account via email or phone. Expiration reminder notices are sent by email for all Pro Studio bundle subscriptions. Expiration reminder notices are sent by email to users who have obtained at trial license for any of our products.</p>

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<p>When a user downloads our software, they will be given the option of opting in to receive marketing material and information via email.</p>

<h2>Community Sites</h2>

<p>When a user enrolls on one of our community sites, they will be asked to provide certain personal information in order for us to create their online account. The user will also be given the option of opting in to receive marketing material via email.</p>

<h2>Ordering</h2>

<p>We request user information during the account setup and purchase processes. Users may be asked to provide contact information (e.g. name and shipping address) and financial information (e.g. credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing and order fulfillment. If we have difficulty processing an order, the contact information may be used to contact the customer.</p>

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>Users are offered the option of subscribing to relevant mailing lists at the time of purchase, and at various other locations throughout the site, for reasons of user convenience only. All new mailing list subscribers will receive a welcome email verifying subscription information. ActiveState’s ASPN “Announce” mailing lists are “receive-only” lists for announcements regarding ActiveState products, services, or promotions. ActiveState’s ASPN “Discuss” mailing lists are moderated lists that provide discussion forums for ActiveState products and technologies. It is not necessary to subscribe to any ASPN mailing list to use our Web site or purchase our products. ASPN includes archives of mailing lists hosted by other sites. ActiveState does not control or own the data collected from these lists. For information regarding the data collection practices of the hosting site, please contact them directly.</p>

<h2>Surveys &amp; Contests</h2>

<p>From time to time, our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user can decide whether or not to disclose their information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age range). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of improving our products and our site.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Our website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When a user submits sensitive information, it is protected both online and offline. Where our registration/order form requires sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted with SSL, the best encryption software in the industry. While on a secure page such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open.</p>

<h2>Suppliers</h2>

<p>We outsource shipping and credit card processing. The companies that perform these services do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ActiveState is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the ActiveState website.</p>

<h2>Public Forums</h2>

<p>ASPN makes mailing list archives, chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. As any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public, caution should be exercised when disclosing personal information.</p>

<h2>Choice/Opt-in</h2>

<p>Our users are given the opportunity to “opt-in” to having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an “opt-in” mechanism so purchasers who wish to receive marketing material can add their email address to our lists. We only add users to our lists when they expressly agree to be added. Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.</p>

<h2>Opting Out</h2>

<p>Periodically, ActiveState notifies our users of new products, announcements, upgrades, and updates. To unsubscribe from ActiveState email updates, click “unsubscribe” at the bottom of the next email you receive from us. Please be aware that you may not opt out of receiving information regarding the initial use, evaluation, or expiration of our products or services.</p>

<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>

<p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post notification of those changes on our homepage so our users are aware of changes to the information we collect, how it is used, and under which circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>If you have questions, or if you feel we are in violation of this privacy policy, please email <a href="mailto:website-feedback@ActiveState.com?subject=Komodo+Website">website-feedback@ActiveState.com</a>. - ActiveState</p>
