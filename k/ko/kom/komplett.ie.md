The above notwithstanding, by using Komplett.ie you acknowledge and agree that your personal data may be made available to third parties (including Comreg), in order for us to comply with laws, regulatory requirements or legal processes, in order to protect and defend our rights and to enforce the terms and conditions and any resulting agreement. You further agree that the IP address of the computer you use to access Komplett.ie may be supplied to An Garda Siochana in connection with fraud or other formal investigations.

We undertake to keep such information confidential except for disclosure to such authorities in connection with such investigations.

You agree that if you send offensive or objectionable content or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on the Site, that that we can use whatever information about you that is available to us to stop such behaviour.

We use and require a cookie for you to register and place an order. It is possible to view products without using cookies. We also endeavour to create a permanent cookie which will be used to recognise you when you return. This cookie can be deleted by logging off your account.

Additionally, our Site uses cookies to keep track of your access to the Site. We may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. You can set your browser preferences to reject all cookies but this will prevent you from using most customised services and you have to repeatedly enter log in information in order to use some services. Cookies make your experience easier by saving your preferences.

**Changes to our Privacy Statement**

Any changes to our Privacy Statement in the future will be posted to the Site and where appropriate, through email notification.

**Right to be supplied with a copy of personal data**

You have the right to be given a copy of your personal data which you may have supplied to us via the Site. To exercise this right, you must make your request in writing, post it and send it to our address as specified above and include with the request, a copy of your passport, a copy utility bill which will verify your address and enclose a fee of €6.35. A request will be dealt with as soon as possible and will take not more than 40 days to process.

**Rectification, Retention and deletion of personal data.**

You also have the right to have inaccurate personal data corrected. If you discover that we hold inaccurate personal data about you, you can (1) sign in to your Komplett Account and change your personal data to the correct data at any given time, or (2) have a right to instruct us to correct that information. Such an instruction must be in writing and will not take more than 40 days to process.

Additionally for safety reasons, we need to keep details of the IP address used to place the order.

If you pay by credit-card, we will for safety reasons, keep the card number for a limited period of time. The credit card companies demand that we keep the card number for effective handling of any possible problems regarding debiting, cancelling a reservation and \ or crediting. We never keep safety codes or passwords in relation to credit card payment. The card number is deleted after the limited period.

In certain circumstances you may also request that personal data which you have supplied via the Site be deleted, if we do not have a legitimate reason for retaining the personal data. We are not entitled to charge for dealing with such a request and we must comply within 40 days of the receipt of such a request. To exercise this right you would generally be expected to identify some contravention of data protection law in the manner in which the Site processes the personal data concerned.
