<p>Kompakt takes data privacy very seriously. We would like you to understand when, how, and what type of data will be collected and stored when you use our website, and the purposes for which we intend to use and process this information.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information (= personal information/data) refers to information that is collected and used in order to determine your identity. This includes for example your name, postal address, telephone number, or e-mail address. It does not apply to the collection of non-personally identifiable information (non-personal information/data), i. e. data collected for statistical purposes, for example on the number of website users. Kompakt collects personally identifiable information when you register on our website, place an order for our products, and/or subscribe to our newsletter. You may, however, visit our website anonymously, i. e. without disclosing any personally identifiable information about yourself.</p>
<p>Please note that no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any data that you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>To keep your personal information safe, data is stored on highly secure servers located in Switzerland. Your data is stored, processed and used exclusively for the purposes of providing you with information on our products and services, contacting you in this context, and processing your orders. Access to your data is restricted to a few authorized individuals, who are responsible for the technical, commercial, or editorial management of the website/servers. When you visit our website, our servers automatically record data for backup and security purposes. Such data may include non-personally identifiable information such as your IP address, or date and time of the page view. We will not use your IP address to identify you in any way, and we will not create personal or pseudonymous user profiles. However, by submitting personally identifiable data through our website or services, you expressly consent to the collection and processing of your data. We reserve the right to use anonymous data, i. e. non-personally identifiable data, for statistical analysis in accordance with the provisions set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Disclosure of Personal Information to Any Third Party</h2>
<p>Generally, we will only use your personal information within Kompakt. We will not pass on any personal information provided by you to any third parties without your explicit consent. We will share information with credit reference agencies for the purpose of credit scoring and performing credit checks. We may disclose your information to service providers who assist us in conducting our business and online related operations, such as processing of orders, shipping, or billing. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information in order to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</p>
<h2>Right of Access to Personal Data, Correction of Data, Withdrawal of Consent</h2>
<p>You have the right to make a subject access request to Kompakt for any personal information we hold about you. You are entitled to know where we got your data from, who we are sharing your data with, the categories of your data, and our purpose/s for processing your data. At any time, you can request us to correct, update, or delete your personal information, and you have the right to object to the processing of your data. Furthermore, you have the right to withdraw your consent to the collection and processing of your personal data at any time, effective for the future. If you wish to contact us regarding our use of your personal data, please e-mail us at: <script type="text/javascript" language="Javascript">

<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a small text file sent by a website to your computer or mobile device where it is stored by your web browser. It holds information a website may need to improve and personalize your site experience.

<p>Cookies are simple, plain text files, they cannot have viruses or install malware onto your computer or mobile device. Furthermore, each cookie can only be read by the original web site that created the cookie. This is a key security feature built into every browser. Every time you revisit one of our pages, your browser sends the cookie back to our server that originally created the text file, thus enabling us to provide customized content that may be of particular interest to you, or information about your last visit to a page on our website. Kompakt uses cookies to generate reports on the number of visits to pages on our website. These cookies contain a uniquely generated random number, a pseudonym that is used to determine unique visitors to our site. They are not used do not gather information about you that could be used to identify you. Generally, these types of cookies are set to expire after 24 hours. The types of cookies used by Kompakt can be referred to as "session cookies" or "persistent cookies", depending on how long they are used: The types of cookies most frequently used on our website are "session cookies". Session cookies are temporary files, which are automatically deleted whenever you close your browser. Kompakt also uses "persistent cookies". Persistent cookies stay on your computer or device after the browser has been closed and last for a longer period of time specified in the cookie. A persistent cookie set on your browser enables the Kompakt website to remember your preferences when you revisit our website. Only in exceptional cases, some pages of the Kompakt website may use cookies that contain personally identifiable information: If you select the "Remember me" option in the password protected login area of our website in order to facilitate the log-in or ordering process (i.e. the auto login function), Kompakt can create a secure cookie that stores your user name of choice or pseudonym, and the encrypted password.

The cookie stored with your browser in your local computer can only be read by the Kompakt website that created the cookie.</p>
<h2>Google Analytics and your Choices of Opting out</h2>
<p>Kompakt uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the Kompakt website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our website (including parts of your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers that are (up to this day) located in the USA. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Kompakt website, compiling reports on website activity for Kompakt's website operators and providing them other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google Inc.

Google Analytics opt out add-on is designed to be compatible with a wide range of web browsers.</p>
<p>Given the debate about the use of web analytics tools that collect the full IP address owners information, we would like to point out that Google will truncate (=shorten) the IP address for Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases the whole IP address is sent to and then shortened by Google servers in the USA.</p>

<p>The Kompakt website uses the Google+ 1 ("plus one") button of the Google Plus social network, provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. The button is identifiable by the "+1" icon on a white or colored background. When you visit a page of the Kompakt website that contains a "+1" plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Google servers. The content of the +1 button is sent by Google directly to your browser and embedded by Google into the web page, enabling Google to receive information about your having accessed the respective page of our website. If you are logged into Google +1, and interact with the embedded Google+ 1 plugin, your visit to our website can be assigned to your Google+ 1 account. If you are a Google+ 1 member and do not want Google to associate data concerning your visit to our website with your Google+1 account, please log off from Google+ 1 before entering our website. Kompakt has no influence on what kind of data Google collects and how it uses the data, and we inform you according to our state of knowledge.
