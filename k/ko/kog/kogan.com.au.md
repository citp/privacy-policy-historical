Personal information is information or an opinion about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can be reasonably ascertained, from that information or opinion.

## 3\. Collection

Kogan will collect personal information only by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way. If it is reasonable and practical to do so, Kogan will only collect personal information about you directly from you. Kogan will not collect personal information unless the information is reasonably necessary for our functions and activities.

Kogan may enter into arrangements with third parties to collect your personal information in circumstances where the third party notifies you, at the time of collection, that your personal information will be provided to Kogan. 

If you use a pseudonym when dealing with us or you do not provide identifiable information Kogan may not be able to provide you with any or all of our services as requested. If you wish to remain anonymous when you use our website do not sign into it or provide any information that might identify you.

Kogan requires individuals to provide accurate, up-to-date and complete personal information at the time it is collected.

## 4\. What does Kogan do with your personal information?

In addition to any purpose notified to you at the time of collection Kogan uses your personal information for the purposes of:

  * providing our services to you;
  * our internal management needs;
  * our marketing activities;
  * responding to any inquiries or comments that you submit to us;
  * any other purpose you have consented to; and
  * any use which is required or authorised by law.



## 5\. Disclosure of personal information

Kogan may disclose your personal information:

  * to third-parties we ordinarily engage for the above purposes;
  * any person or entity to whom you have consented to Kogan disclosing your personal information to; and
  * any person or entity to whom we are required or authorised to disclose your personal information to in accordance with the law.



## 6\. Access and Management

You may request access to your personal information in our customer account database, or seek correction of it, by contacting our customer service team. See section 8: Contact information.

Kogan may charge a reasonable fee that is not excessive to cover the charges of retrieving your personal information from our customer account database. Kogan will not charge you for making the request.

If you believe that Kogan holds personal information about you in our customer account database that is not accurate, complete, up-to-date, relevant or information that is misleading then you may request its amendment and Kogan will respond to your request within a reasonable time. Kogan will not charge you for correcting your personal information. 

If Kogan no longer needs your personal information for any the purposes set out in this policy, or as otherwise required by law, Kogan will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to destroy the information or to de-identify it.

Kogan will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information it holds from misuse, interference and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

At any time you may opt out of receiving direct marketing communications from us. Unless you opt out, your consent to receive direct marketing communications from us and to the handling of your personal information as detailed above, will continue.

## 8\. Cross-border disclosure

Kogan may transfer your personal information to a person who is in a foreign country to assist Kogan in providing you with the service that you have requested.
