Safe Ticket Purchasing Guaranteed

Why is KoreanAir.com so safe?

**Airtight information security technology!** KoreanAir.com is safe, because our secure server provides 40-bit decryption/encryption (currently the International Standard) for **all your data!** When you first log onto your personalized page, Korean Air's secure server receives your encrypted (encoded) information. (Your browser automatically encrypts information you submit over the Internet to ensure that no one can read it during transmission.) The power of Korean Air's secure server is twofold: 1) it can decrypt (decode) information transmitted from your browser and 2) re-encrypt information that it sends back to you. Essentially, this decryption/encryption process cloaks your data by translating it into a secret code which only Korean Air can read, keeping your credit card and other personal information airtight while it travels over the Internet. Purchasing tickets online at KoreanAir.com is even safer than using your credit card at a travel agency or department store!

Will Korean Air release my personal information to others?

**No way!** The information you submit is just between us! Once we receive your data, it is automatically protected against unauthorized access, and Korean Air commits to you that we will never release any of your information to an outside company or entity. 

How can I tell if a KoreanAir.com web page is secure?

**See the secure-lock image!** You can tell which Web pages are secure, because each secure page shows a picture of a secure lock. In addition, your browser itself identifies secure pages. On the toolbar in Netscape, there is a secure-lock icon that becomes highlighted when a secure page is open. Similarly, in Internet Explorer you should see a lock icon in the lower right corner showing that a page is secure. (Of course, you will not see this icon on non-secure pages.)

What are cookies?

"Cookies" are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies generated from KoreanAir.com may contain some personal-preference information you provide such as favorite language, destination, and the like. However, cookies do not contain credit card, address, or other private information.

Our Commitment

Korean Air is committed to securing your privacy. The only way in which we use the information you provide to us is to make your Web experience easier and more personalized.

Your Consent

By using KoreanAir.com, we assume that you consent to the collection and use of this information by Korean Air only.

* Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank may not hold you responsible for more than $50.00 in fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, Korean Air will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. Korean Air will only cover this liability if your credit card's unauthorized use was beyond your control and transpired from purchases made at KoreanAir.com while using our secure server.

**If your credit card is used without your consent as in the condition described above, you must notify your credit card company according to its reporting procedures and rules.
