## RAKUTEN KOBO INC.

## PRIVACY POLICY

Last updated: November 22, 2018

Rakuten Kobo Inc., or in respect of residents of Europe, Kobo Europe S.A., (“Kobo”, “we”, “us” or “our”) operates an digital reading platform that enables customers to acquire and read written works through a variety of electronic devices and software applications (“Kobo Platform”). Kobo is part of the Rakuten Group, which includes the affiliates and subsidiaries of our parent company Rakuten, Inc., based in Tokyo, Japan. More information about Rakuten is available at <http://global.rakuten.com/corp/about/company>. 

This Privacy Policy explains how Kobo, as data controller, collects, uses and shares personal information in association with the services we provide through the Kobo Platform, including the Kobo eReading service (the "Kobo Services") and the account you use to access the Kobo Services (the "Kobo Account"). 

#### Collection of personal information

"Personal information" (also referred to as "Personal Data" in some jurisdictions) is any information that can be used to identify you or that we can link to you. 

We collect, process and use your personal information when you: 

  * register for a Kobo Account or log into an existing account;
  * visit our website;
  * order products or content from us;
  * access the Kobo Platform or use the Kobo Services; or
  * contact us for customer care.



The information we collect is typically related to the product or service you request and include: 

  * your name and title;
  * address and email address;
  * the nature of the product or service requested;
  * connection and service usage details;
  * payment information; and
  * related information which we may need to fulfill your request.



#### Cookies and similar tools

We use browser cookies and similar technologies (collectively, "cookies") to collect and store certain information when you use, access or interact with Kobo Services. More information about our cookie policy is available. 

#### Children under 16 years of age

Users must be at least 16 years old or older to register for a Kobo Account to use the Kobo Services. Kobo does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 16. If a parent or guardian believes that Kobo has in its database the personal information of a child under the age of 16, please contact us at [privacy@kobo.com](mailto:privacy@kobo.com) and we will use our best efforts to remove the information from our records. 

#### How we use the information we collect

**(a) Managing your Kobo Account**

We collect your personal information to: (a) create and manage your Kobo Account; (b) monitor and manage your purchase transactions; including administration; provisioning; billing and reconciliation; verification of your identity, solvency and creditworthiness (c) comply with legal and regulatory requirements and with the competent judicial authorities in each geographical jurisdiction that Kobo operates in; (d) maintain, support and develop the products and services you purchase; and (e) perform statistical analysis. We also use your information to assess risk and detect and prevent fraud. Any fraudulent misuse of your Kobo Account or the Kobo Platform may result in the suspension or cancellation of your Kobo Account. 

For example, this information allows us to ensure that digital content is sent to you in compliance with applicable geographic rights and usage limitations applicable to the content. We will also send you service, support and administrative messages, reminders, technical notices, updates, security alerts and information requested by you, such as in response to a request for customer assistance. Emails and messages concerning the administration and operation of your Kobo Account and/or the Kobo Services will be sent to you. If you opt out of receiving these communications, we may be unable to provide the services to you. 

**(b) Organizing contests**

From time to time, Kobo may invite you to enter various contests or promotions. If you choose to participate in a contest or promotion, your personal information may be used to administer the contest, such as to determine your eligibility for the contest or to award a prize. 

Kobo’s contests or promotion may be operated with other organizations. This will be identified in the contest rules. The contest rules will additionally identify if your personal information will be shared with the other organization and if so, the purposes for the disclosure and your privacy rights. This data collection and sharing may be necessary for the consideration of your participation. 

**(c) Sending newsletters and marketing emails**

With your permission we also want to provide you with the most up-to-date information about our services, products, and other information that might be of interest to you when using services from Kobo and/or our affiliates and partners. 

To offer you more personalized offers and/or special offers, discounts and other information, Kobo may send you newsletters, discounts, promotion codes, and general information about the Rakuten Group including its affiliate companies (such as Viber and eBates), if you consent. Your consent is not required as a condition of using the Kobo Service, and you may withdraw it at any time. 

#### How we may share the information we collect

We may share the information we collect, including your personal information, with third parties under the following circumstances (including intra-group transfers and transfers to entities in countries that do not provide statutory protections for personal information): 

  * Service providers and business partners. We may share your personal information with our service providers and business partners that perform marketing services and other business operations on our behalf and under our instructions. For example, we may partner with other companies to process secure payments, fulfill orders, optimize Kobo Services, send our newsletters and marketing emails, support email and messaging services and analyze information. 
  * Retailer partners. We may share your personal information with various retailer partners in the country where you live. 
  * Rakuten Group companies. Kobo works closely with its affiliated businesses and companies within the Rakuten Group. Subject to applicable law, we may share certain information about you and your activities on the Kobo Platform with other Rakuten Group companies for statistical aggregation, marketing purposes and internal reporting, and to incorporate your data into databases controlled by us or our affiliates or agents for the purpose of providing services revenue and customer analysis and reporting; market and customer use analysis. 
  * You may choose to identify yourself to Kobo by creating a new account or by using a third party identification verification and authentication service supported by Kobo. If you choose to create a new account with Kobo instead of using other credentials supported by a third party identification service, then your account credentials, consisting of your e-mail address and encrypted password, will be stored and processed by Rakuten Inc., which will also allow your account credentials to be used to access certain websites and services of other Rakuten Group companies. The other Rakuten Group websites and services may request personal information from you if you use their services, and if you provide this information, then it will be governed by their respective privacy policies and not this Rakuten Kobo privacy policy. 
  * Protection of rights and other legal purposes. We may share the information we collect, including personal information, with law enforcement or to otherwise comply with any statutory or regulatory requirement or the order of a court or other public authority agency, regulator, government authority or other third party where we believe this is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of any third party. 
  * Asset purchases. We may share the information we collect, including personal information, with any third party that purchases, or to which we transfer, all or substantially all of our assets and business. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the entity to which we transfer your personal information uses it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. 



#### Data transfers from the EU

If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from E.U. or U.S. law, please note that you may be transferring your personal information to the Rakuten Group in the United States and in other countries around the world for the purposes described in the third bullet above under the heading “How we may share the information we collect”. We take great care in protecting your personal information and have put in place adequate mechanisms to protect it when it is transferred internationally. 

As part of the Rakuten Group, Kobo relies on the Rakuten Binding Corporate Rules to legitimize international data transfers within the group. The Rakuten Binding Corporate Rules have been approved with the Data Protection Authority of Luxembourg acting as the lead authority and can be found at <https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/bcr.html>. 

Additionally, for the transfers to Canada we rely on the Commission Decision 2002/2/EC granting adequate protection for personal data in Canada pursuant to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c.5., as amended (“PIPEDA”), and Canada’s anti-spam legislation, amending the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Act, the Competition Act, PIPEDA and the Telecommunications Act (S.C. 2010, c. 23), as well as the Digital Privacy Act (S.C. 2015, c. 32) and certain provincial legislation deemed substantially similar to PIPEDA. 

#### Legal bases for using your personal information

There are different legal bases that we rely on to use your personal information, namely: 

  * **Performance of a contract –** The use of your personal information may be necessary to perform the Terms of Use under which we provide the Kobo Service to you and the Terms of Sale under which we sell goods to you. 
  * **Consent –** We will rely on your consent to use (i) technical information such as cookie data and geolocation data as described in our Cookie Policy; and (ii) your personal information for marketing purposes. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address that appears at the end of this Privacy Policy, or by following an unsubscribe link in any marketing communication you receive from us. 
  * **Legitimate interests –** We may use your personal information for our legitimate interests to improve our products and services and the content available on the Kobo Platform. 
  * If we need to further process (or engage data processors to further process) your personal information, we will let you know if there is a new purpose for that further processing that is not compatible with the notices and consents that we have from you, and we will provide you with any relevant further information. 



#### Third party websites

The Kobo Platform may contain links to websites not owned or controlled by Kobo. Kobo does not have any control over these third-party websites. We encourage you to be aware of these other third-party websites and their privacy statements, as we cannot control and are not responsible for privacy policies or practices of third party websites. 

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information collected by Kobo. Please review the Terms of Use for more information. 

#### Security and data retention

We deploy administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to safeguard the information that we collect. We evaluate these safeguards on an ongoing basis to help minimize risks from new security threats as they become known. 

However, no information system can be 100% secure. So, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to us over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks. 

We retain the information collected via the Kobo Services until such time as you choose to close your Kobo Account. After that time, we may anonymize and aggregate the data and retain the data in that form for the same analytical purposes stated above. 

#### Your choices and your rights

You can unsubscribe or opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us in your settings by clicking “Account Settings” under “My Account” once logged into your Kobo Account. Or you can click the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of an automatic email. You can also deactivate your Kobo Account at <http://www.kobo.com/help/deactivateaccount>. 

You can change information about your account by connecting to your Kobo Account and modifying the information listed in the “About Me” tab. Some of this information is optional and you are not required to provide it to us, however other information such as payment information is required for Kobo to be able to provide you with our services. You are not required to provide any information to us that is unnecessary to provide the Kobo Services. 

Subject to local law, you may have certain rights regarding information that we have collected and that is related to you. We encourage you to contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if you believe that any information that we have collected about you is inaccurate. 

Consistent with legal requirements and limitations, you can also ask us: 

  * to see what personal information we hold about you;
  * to erase your personal information;
  * to port your personal information; and
  * to restrict our use of your personal information.



Please note that we will likely require additional information from you in order to honor your requests. 

If you would like to discuss or exercise such rights, send us an email at [privacy@kobo.com](mailto:privacy@kobo.com). Alternatively, you may have a right to complain to your local data protection authority (if one exists in your country). 

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The effective date of the current Privacy Policy is noted at the top of this page. We may advise you in writing where we materially change these terms, however we encourage you to periodically review this page for updated terms.
