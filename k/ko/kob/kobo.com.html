                <li>Purchasing and submitting content from the Kobo Service requires a user to register for an account. Personal information is required, including Your real name, email address, password, and country of residence. If You are logged in, You will be identified by Your user name. This may be Your real name if You so choose, or You may choose to publish under a pseudonym, whatever user name You selected when You created Your account.</li>  
             
                <li>When making a purchase on Kobo We will ask You for more information as is necessary to complete Your purchase, and will store that information in Your account until You tell Us to remove it.</li>  
             
                <li>We ask for some personal information when You create a Kobo user account, including Your email address and a password, which is used to protect Your account from unauthorized access.</li>  
             
                <li>We may record information about Your usage, such as when and how often You use the Kobo Service as well as information You display or click on within the Kobo Service (including UI elements, settings, and other information), and may share this information to trusted third parties, including Our publishers or other suppliers of content. </li>  
             
                <li>For magazine and newspaper subscriptions, We may be required to share personal information and other data regarding your account to Our publishers or other suppliers of content, for their internal use only including for sales reports and aggregate circulation reporting.

                <li>You must be 13 years and older to register to use the Kobo Service. As a result, the Kobo Service does not specifically collect information about children. If We learn that the Kobo Service has collected information from a child under the age of 13, We will delete that information as quickly as possible. Minors between the ages of 13 and the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which such minor resides must receive their parents' permission before using Kobo or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.</li>

Kobo cookies do not collect personal information, and We do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell Us who You are or what Your screen name or e-mail address is. </li>  
             
                <li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct You on how to prevent Your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell You when You receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that You leave the cookies activated because cookies may allow You to make use of some Kobo Service features. </li>  
  
                <li>Some of Our business partners, like Our advertisers, may use cookies on Our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.</li>

                <li>Every time You visit a web page, You send information to the web server. Most web servers routinely maintain access logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites link to this one, and what web browsers people are using. </li>  
             
                <li>These logs are used to produce site statistics; the raw log data is not made public. </li>  
             
                <li>Log data may be examined by developers and administrators in the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site. IP addresses of Users, derived either from those logs or from records in the database are frequently used to correlate usernames and network addresses in investigating abuse of the Kobo Service, including vandalism, harassment of other users, or other disruptions of the site.</li>
