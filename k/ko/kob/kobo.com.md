**(a) User Accounts and Personal Information**

This may be Your real name if You so choose, or You may choose to publish under a pseudonym, whatever user name You selected when You created Your account.
  * When making a purchase on the Kobo Service We will ask You for more information as is necessary to complete Your purchase, and will store that information in Your account until You tell Us to remove it
  * We ask for some personal information when You create a Kobo user account, including Your email address and a password, which is used to protect Your account from unauthorized access.
  * We may record information about Your usage, such as when and how often You use the Kobo Service as well as information You display or click on within the Kobo Service (including UI elements, settings, and other information.
  * For magazine and newspaper subscriptions, We may be required to share personal information and other data regarding your account to Our publishers or other suppliers of content, for their internal use only including for sales reports and aggregate circulation reporting. If you give Your consent, the applicable publisher or supplier of content may contact you for marketing purposes.
  * We may use Your usage information to vary Your experience. For example, We may present content that We think would be of interest to You, based on the information We record about Your usage.
  * When You visit Kobo, We will collect Your browser type and IP address and may use that information to vary Your experience.
  * If You are logged in, We may associate that information with Your account.
  * We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. "Web Beacons") in HTML-based emails sent to Our Users to track which emails are opened by recipients.
  * Any personal information or content that You voluntarily disclose online (in comments, reviews, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. If You contribute to the Kobo Service, You are publishing every word You post publicly. If You write something, assume that it may be retained forever.



**(b) Email**

  * When You enter in a contract with Kobo to access the Kobo Service by creating a Kobo account and accept Our Terms of Use And Privacy Policy, You agree that We can send You emails related to the Kobo Service or the products purchased by You. You can change this option at any time via Your [Account Settings](https://www.kobobooks.com/account/accountsettings.html), or by utilizing Our unsubscribe mechanism included in each email We send.

If We learn that the Kobo Service has collected information from a child under the age of 13, We will delete that information as quickly as possible. Minors between the ages of 13 and the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which such minor resides must receive their parents' permission before using Kobo or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.



**(e)Cookies**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that We transfer to Your computer's hard drive through Your Web browser to enable Our systems to recognize Your browser and tell Us how and when pages in Our website are visited and by how many people. Kobo cookies do not collect personal information, and We do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell Us who You are or what Your screen name or e-mail address is.
  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct You on how to prevent Your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell You when You receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that You leave the cookies activated because cookies may allow You to make use of some Kobo Service features.
  * Some of Our business partners, like Our advertisers, may use cookies on Our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.



**(f) Private Logging**

  * Every time You visit a web page, You send information to the web server. Most web servers routinely maintain access logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites link to this one, and what web browsers people are using.
  * These logs are used to produce site statistics; the raw log data is not made public.
  * Log data may be examined by developers and administrators in the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site. IP addresses of Users, derived either from those logs or from records in the database are frequently used to correlate usernames and network addresses in investigating abuse of the Kobo Service, including vandalism, harassment of other users, or other disruptions of the site.
