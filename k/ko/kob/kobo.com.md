More information about Rakuten is available at <http://global.rakuten.com/corp/about/company>. 

We operate websites, mobile applications, a digital reading platform that enables customers to acquire and read or listen to written works (through ebooks, audiobooks or podcasts) using a variety of electronic devices, software applications , and other services (collectively, the "Kobo Services") and the account you use in association with the Kobo Services (the "Kobo Account"). 

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose Personal Information (as defined below) about you when you use your Kobo Account or any Kobo Services that link to this Policy, including Kobo Writing Life, the author self-publishing service. 

#### Collection of personal information

"Personal Information" is any information or a combination of pieces of information that can reasonably permit you to be identified, or that can reasonably be linked to you. Information that is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person is not Personal Information and may be used for any business purpose. 

We collect Personal Information about you from a variety of sources. We collect information from you directly (e.g., when you contact us or create an account with us), automatically, (e.g., data collected via cookies and similar technologies when you use the Kobo Services), and from other sources, including commercially available sources, such as public databases (where permitted by law). 

For example, we collect, process and use your Personal Information when you: 

  * register for a Kobo Account or log into an existing account;
  * interact with the Kobo Services;
  * order products or content from us;
  * use the Kobo Services to access electronic content; or
  * contact us for customer care.

##### Payment information

We collect your payment information when you purchase e-content or sign up for subscription-based services. 

##### Communications

We may also collect information you provide in your communications to us, such as when you respond to polls or surveys, write a review, or contact us with a question, comment, or request. You may choose to provide us with certain information when you upload e-content to the Services as a member of Kobo Writing Life, fill out a form, submit a request to our customer care team, respond to a survey, submit ratings and reviews or participate in promotions or contests.

These types of decisions will not have legal or similar effects for you, but you can still contact us for further information.

##### Personal Information we Disclose

To support our business purposes, we disclose your Personal Information to service providers and business partners who are data processors. We disclose your Personal Information with our service providers that perform business services and/or operations on our behalf or under our instructions. 

For example, we may partner with other companies to process secure payments, provide authentication services, optimize Kobo Services, fulfill orders, perform analytics, send our newsletters and marketing emails, support email and messaging services, administer our promotions, provide targeted advertising services as a processor to Kobo, and provide sweepstakes, contests, and surveys. Some of our service providers or business partners may engage their own service providers or business partners to further assist us. Unless otherwise specified, we require these companies to use Personal Information only for the purposes described in this Policy. 

We may share your account credentials and other related Personal Information (such as, username, email address, encrypted password, first and last name) with the Rakuten Group companies. The Rakuten Group aims to provide you with a unique service experience through the “Rakuten ID” or Kobo “Global ID”.

Your data will only be shared if you chose to connect to another Rakuten ID service. By connecting to another Rakuten ID service, you direct the Rakuten ID services to share your data for the purposes explained in our joint privacy policy here: <https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/rakuten-id/>. We share your account credentials and profile information (address and date of birth, where provided) with the Rakuten ID services. This service is jointly provided by the Rakuten ID Services as directed by you, if you sign up with another Rakuten ID Service. 

##### Law enforcement agencies, courts, regulators and government authorities

We may share the information we collect, including Personal Information, with law enforcement or to otherwise comply with any statutory or regulatory requirement or the order of a court or other public authority agency, regulator, government authority or other third party where we believe this is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of any third party. 

##### In the context of a transaction

We may share the information we collect, including Personal Information, with any third party that purchases, or to which we transfer, all or substantially all of our assets and business. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the entity to which we transfer your Personal Information uses it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

#### Legal basis for using your Personal Information.

##### Data Transfer 

We may transfer your Personal Information to Rakuten Group entities and service providers located outside of your home country, including to countries outside the EEA for the purposes described in the subsections above (“How we may share the information we collect”). Your Personal Information may need to be processed in countries where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in your home country. Please note that we may be transferring your Personal Information to the United States of America, Canada, Mexico, France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Japan as well as other countries where we have active retailer partners and third-party business partners or service providers who may be data processors. In such cases, we will require the recipient to provide appropriate protection for the Personal Information disclosed to it, in compliance with applicable data protection laws. 

We take great care in protecting your Personal Information and have put in place mechanisms to protect it when it is transferred internationally, consistent with applicable law. 

As part of the Rakuten Group, Kobo relies on the Rakuten Binding Corporate Rules to legitimize international data transfers within the group. The Rakuten Binding Corporate Rules have been approved by the Data Protection Authority of Luxembourg acting as the lead authority and can be found at <https://corp.rakuten.co.jp/privacy/en/bcr.html>. 

Additionally, for the transfers to Canada we rely on the Commission Decision 2002/2/EC granting adequate protection for personal data in Canada pursuant to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c.5., as amended (“PIPEDA”), and Canada’s anti-spam legislation, amending the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Act, the Competition Act, PIPEDA and the Telecommunications Act (S.C. 2010, c. 23), as well as the Digital Privacy Act (S.C. 2015, c. 32) and certain provincial legislation deemed substantially similar to PIPEDA. 

##### Legal basis for processing your Personal Information if you are in the EEA

If you use the Kobo Services while in the EEA, we must have a legal basis to process your Personal Information for the purposes above, including data received from social media platforms, data received from other sources used for statistics or data shared with third party advertisers. There are different legal bases that we rely on to use your Personal Information, namely: 

  * **Performance of a contract** – The use of your Personal Information may be necessary to send you Emails and messages concerning the administration and operation of your Kobo Account and/or the Kobo Services.
  * **Consent** – We will rely on your consent to use (i) technical information; and (ii) your Personal Information for marketing and advertising purposes. You may withdraw your consent at any time by following an unsubscribe link in any marketing communication you receive from us. 
  * **Legitimate interests** – We may use your Personal Information for our legitimate interests to improve our products and services and the content available on the Kobo Platform. These improvements are dependent on analyzing (for example) how you use the Services, such as pages you view, the rate at which you consume e-content (how often, and for how long), genres, authors or subject matter you prefer and searches you make or share, the ebooks or audiobooks you have liked, comments you have left, websites you have viewed through links, the success rate(s) of any promotion or event, certain technical information about your device, or when you access our application through a certain device, purchase path or transactional data and customer care interactions. We will also use your Personal Information for security purposes, and to share information with our affiliates for internal administration based on legitimate interest.
  * **Legal obligation and public interest** – Where compelled by applicable law, we may also have a legal obligation to collect your Personal Information, or may otherwise need your Personal Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.



If we need to further process your Personal Information, we will let you know if there is a different legal basis for that further processing that is not compatible with the notices and consents that we have already from you, and we will provide you with any relevant further information and consent options.

(“Kobo,” “we,” "our,” or “us”) maintain our websites including www.kobo.com, www.kobobooks.com, and our other related websites, mobile applications, eReaders, and other services (collectively, the “Services”). We, along with our vendors, use a variety of technologies to learn more about how people use the Services. You can find out more about these technologies and how to control them in the information below and by reviewing our Privacy Policy here. 

#### Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies: How We Use Them

Like most companies, we use cookies and similar technologies such as cookie IDs and settings, and tracker software tools (“cookies”). 

We may use cookies for a variety of purposes and to enhance your online experience, for example, by remembering your log-in status. 

We use both session and persistent tracking technologies. Tracking technologies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). 

We also use first and third-party cookies. First party cookies are used and controlled by us to provide services for the Services. Third-party cookies are controlled by third-parties, mostly for analytics purposes. 

We and our third-party service providers or business partners may collect information about you automatically through the use of cookies and similar technologies, including information over time and across different websites or online services. We may collect such information when you access content, advertising, sites, interactive widgets, applications, and other products (both on and off of our Kobo Services) where Kobo’s data collection technologies (such as web development tools, cookies and other technologies) are present, including in the emails we send to you. We use browser cookies and similar technologies such as cookie IDs and settings, and tracker software tools (collectively, "cookies") to collect and store certain information when you use, access or interact with Kobo Services. These data collection technologies allow us to understand your activity on and off our Kobo Services and to collect and store information when you interact with Kobo Services we offer to partners. We and our retail partners automatically collect information from cookies and similar technologies to recognize you, learn how you interact with the Kobo Services and use your devices, and to serve you with surveys, tailored promotions and other marketing and content recommendations. You may limit our ability to automatically collect certain types of information by adjusting the cookie settings on your web browsers. 

Subject to local law, you may have certain rights regarding information that we have collected from cookies and that is related to you. We encourage you to contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if you believe that any information that we have collected about you is inaccurate. Please note that we will likely require additional information from you in order to honour your requests. If you would like to discuss or exercise such rights, send us an email at [privacy@kobo.com](mailto:privacy@kobo.com). Alternatively, you may have a right to complain to your local data protection authority (if one exists in your country).

Controlling the HTML5 local storage on your browser depends on which browser you use.
