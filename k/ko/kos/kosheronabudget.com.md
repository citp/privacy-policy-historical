# Privacy Policy - Kosher on a Budget

Your privacy is important to me. Like most standard websites, the Kosher on a Budget blog uses log files. These include: Internet Protocol addresses (IP addresses), browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and the number of clicks.

This information is gathered in order to track user movement in the aggregate and to analyze trends. None of the information gathered is linked to personally identifiable information.

In addition, Kosher on a Budget contains links to other websites, including other blogs, as well as affiliate links to advertising partners. There are also advertisements placed by outside networks and private companies displayed on my blog. These ads may contain cookies.

Kosher on a Budget also uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
