## Information We Automatically Collect

We automatically collect information that does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable user (" **Non-Personal Information** ") to help us understand how our users use the Site. For example, each time you use the Site we automatically collect your IP address and other information about your Internet connectivity. In addition, we send one or more cookies (a small file containing a string of characters) to your computer that uniquely identifies your Web browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people search. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Certain of our Service Providers (defined below) may use cookies in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.

## Information You Choose To Submit

We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or billing information, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information (" **Personal Information** ") only if you choose to share such information with us. For example, you may be required to provide us with certain Personal Information to register with the Site, subscribe to one of our services, enter sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, and at other times. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content or features or participate in certain areas of the Site.

## How Do We Use, And When Do We Share, Personal and Non-Personal Information We Collect?

We use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for internal purposes, such as enhancing your experience at the Site; performing administration and technical support for the Site; notifying you about our new and existing content, events, products or services; enabling you to enter sweepstakes, contests and other promotions; and creating aggregated information about demographics and usage patterns.

We will not sell, share or rent Personal Information to third parties, and we will not otherwise disclose Personal Information to third parties, without your permission, except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours (" **Service Providers** "). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services including credit card processing, data management, promotional services, Web hosting, Web development, etc. We provide our service providers with the information needed for them to perform these services. Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure.

We may use third party advertisement serving companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies may use information about your visit to the Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to the Site, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as pixel tags in connection to the Site. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third party advertisement serving company may collect from you.

Although unlikely, in certain instances we may disclose your Personal Information when we have reason to believe it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to Kosmix, to its affiliates or to others. We may also disclose your Personal Information when we believe the law requires it.

We may use, and disclose to third parties, certain aggregated Non-Personal Information (e.g., the number of users who searched for a particular term, how many users clicked on a particular advertisement, the number of users who reside in a particular geographic location, etc.) without your permission. However, such information does not identify you individually.

We also may share Personal Information and Non-Personal Information with companies affiliated with Kosmix. In the event that Kosmix is merged, or in the event of a transfer of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Non-Personal Information in connection with such transaction. In the event of such a transfer, we will notify you of the change of control of your Personal Information. You should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the authority under certain circumstances to permit Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission.

## Security

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through Site, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Site, and you do so at your own risk.

## Third Party Website Links And Content

The Site may contain links to websites or content operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. Privacy policies on such linked websites may be different from our Privacy Policy. You access such linked websites or third party content at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked website before disclosing any information on such site.

## E-mail Newsletters/Services

We may send you e-mails regarding Kosmix, the Site or a special promotion or event. All such e-mails contain an opt-out mechanism if you do not wish to receive future e-mails from us.

## Children's Privacy Statement

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a user under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records. Because we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third parties.

## Policy Changes

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, we will inform you by posting the changed Privacy Policy on the Site. Those changes will go into effect on the Effective Date disclosed in the changed Privacy Policy. The new Privacy Policy will apply to all current and past users of the Site and will replace any prior Privacy Policies that are inconsistent.
