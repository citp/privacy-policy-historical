<!--begin question-->Yahoo! Privacy Policy<!--end question-->
</h1>
<!--begin answer--><h2>WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS </h2>

<h3>Yahoo! takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn
more about our privacy policy.</h3>

<h3>How Yahoo! Uses Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>This policy covers how Yahoo! treats personal information that Yahoo!
collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Yahoo!
products and services. Personal information is information about you that is
personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone
number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>

<h3>This privacy policy only applies to Yahoo!</h3>

<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo! does
not own or control, or to people that Yahoo! does not employ or manage. In
addition, some companies that Yahoo! has acquired have their own, preexisting
privacy policies which may be viewed on our <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/acquiredcompanies/">acquired
companies page</a>.</p><span><br></span>

<h2><a name="2"></a>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>Yahoo! collects personal information when you register with Yahoo!, when you
use <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/ide/all/">Yahoo! products or services</a>,
when you visit Yahoo! pages or the pages of certain Yahoo! partners, and when
you enter <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/ide/yahoo/promotions/">promotions
or sweepstakes</a>. Yahoo! may combine information about you that we have with
information we obtain from business partners or other companies. </p>

<p>When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address,
birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For
some financial products and services we might also ask for your address, Social
Security number, and information about your assets. When you register with Yahoo!
and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. </p>

<p>Yahoo! collects information about your transactions with us and with some of
our business partners, including information about your use of financial
products and services that we offer.</p>

<p>Yahoo! automatically receives and records information from your computer and
browser, including your <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/ide/yahoo/ip/">IP
address</a>, Yahoo! <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/ide/yahoo/cookies/">cookie</a>
information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.</p>

<p>Yahoo! uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the
advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and
services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide
anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. </p>

<h3>Minors</h3>

<p>Yahoo! does not contact individuals under age 18 about special offers or for
marketing purposes without an adult's permission. </p>

<p>Yahoo! does not ask an individual under age 18 for more personal information, as a
condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a
given activity or promotion.</p>



<br>

<h2><a name="3"></a>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE </h2>

<p>Yahoo! does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with
other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services
you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul type="disc"><li>We provide the information to
 trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Yahoo! under
 confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal
 information to help Yahoo! communicate with you about offers from Yahoo!
 and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any
 independent right to share this information. </li>
<li>We have a parent's permission
 to share the information if the user is an individual under age 18. Parents have
 the option of allowing Yahoo! to collect and use their child's information
 without consenting to Yahoo! sharing of this information with people and
 companies who may use this information for their own purposes.</li>
<li>We respond to subpoenas,
 court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal
 rights or defend against legal claims.</li>
<li>We believe it is necessary to
 share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
 regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving
 potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Yahoo!'s
 terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. </li>
<li>We transfer information about
 you if Yahoo! is acquired by or merged with another company. In this
 event, Yahoo! will notify you before information about you is transferred
 and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </li>
</ul>

<p>Yahoo! displays targeted advertisements based on personal information.
Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who
interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for
example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. </p>

<ul type="disc"><li>Yahoo! does not provide any
 personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a
 targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting
 to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you
 meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. </li>
<li>Yahoo! advertisers include
 financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock
 brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores,
 airlines, and software companies). </li>
</ul>

<p>Yahoo! works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service
providers in different industries and categories of business. For more
information regarding providers of products or services that you've requested
please read our detailed <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/ide/all/">reference
links</a>. </p><span><br></span>

<h2><a name="4"></a>COOKIES</h2>

<p>Yahoo! may set and access Yahoo! <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/ide/yahoo/cookies/">cookies</a> on your
computer.</p>

<p>Yahoo! lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access
their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is
subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other
companies do not have access to Yahoo!'s cookies.</p>

<p>Yahoo! uses <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/ide/yahoo/webbeacons/">web
beacons</a> to access Yahoo! cookies inside and outside our network of web
sites and in connection with Yahoo! products and services.</p>

<h2>YOUR ABILITY TO EDIT AND DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND PREFERENCES</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>You can edit your <a href="http://edit.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile">Yahoo!
Account Information</a>, including your <a href="http://subscribe.yahoo.com/showaccount">marketing preferences</a>, at any
time. </p>

<p>New categories of marketing communications might be added to the Marketing
Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can opt out of
receiving future marketing communications from these new categories or they can
unsubscribe by following instructions contained in the messages they receive. </p>

<p>We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Yahoo!
service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Yahoo!
Newsletter, that are considered part of your Yahoo! account, without offering
you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. </p>

<p>You can delete your Yahoo! account by visiting our <a href="https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_user">Account Deletion</a> page.
Please <a href="/privacy/ide/yahoo/datastorage/">click here</a>
to read about information that might possibly remain in our archived records
after your account has been deleted. </p>



<br>

<h2><a name="5"></a>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</h2>

<p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we
believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide
products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. </p>

<p>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal
regulations to protect personal information about you. </p>

<p>To learn more about security, including the security steps we have taken and
security steps you can take, please read <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/ide/yahoo/security/">Security at Yahoo!</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="6"></a>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<p>Yahoo! may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes
in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary
email address specified in your Yahoo! account or by placing a prominent notice
on our site. </p>
