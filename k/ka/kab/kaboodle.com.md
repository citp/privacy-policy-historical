#### 3\. How Do We Share The Information We Collect?

We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise transfer personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company without your consent to do so. We may, however, disclose personally identifiable information: to our affiliated companies, carriers, third party service providers and/or agents, as reasonably necessary to provide you with the Services you have requested; as required by law or legal process; in response to lawful requests for information by governmental agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, authorized to request such information; to enforce our contractual agreements, including investigation of potential violations thereof; to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies and to otherwise protect our interests; to help detect and prevent harm to persons or property or otherwise to protect public safety; to third parties that perform functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to, third parties that host or operate our Services, analyze data, perform email list management services, provide customer service, or provide public relations and marketing services; and to vendors of products and services that are offered through the Services.

We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users on the Services and the geographic distribution of our users). As such, in no way to limit the foregoing, we may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, industry organizations, and prospective affiliates.

We do not enable third parties, except for certain subcontractors of the Company, to collect information directly from users while they interact with Services. Our subcontractors only collect and use information at our direction and only to support the functioning of the Services and to perform analytics. Our subcontractor may not share this information with third parties.

As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In any such transaction, as well in the event all or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of our users will generally be one of the transferred assets. We reserve the right to include your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party.

Information collected by or sent to us may be stored and processed in any country in which we and our affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities.

We follow commercially accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to or collected by us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

In the event of an inadvertent disclosure of your personal information, we will take all commercially reasonable steps to limit and remedy the disclosure as required by the applicable law. In light of the foregoing, your use and access of the Services is at your own risk.

#### 8\. How Far Does Our Responsibility Extend?

This Policy applies to the Services that are owned and operated by us. The Services and our communications to you may contain links to other third party sites that may offer products or services that our users might find useful.

You agree that your continued use of the Services shall constitute your acceptance of the Policy as revised.
