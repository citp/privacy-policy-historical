<p>We shall require the customer's knowledge and consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of their personal information, except where required or permitted by law. 
</p><h3>Principle 4 - Limiting Collection</h3>
<p>Any personal information we collect from our customer, by fair and lawful means, will be limited to only those details necessary for the identified purpose. We will not collect more information than we need to fulfill the purpose identified to our customer.
</p><h3>Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention</h3>
<p>Our customer's personal information will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the customer's consent or as required by law. We will keep customer's personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose identified to our customer.

<p>We will provide and make readily available to customers information on our policies, procedures and practices relating to how the customer's personal information is managed.
</p><h3>Principle 9 - Customer Access</h3>

  to your personal information is limited to people who need it to do their job in our office. </p>
  
  <h3>Data Retention</h3>
 
  <p>The Kabalarian Philosophy will not retain your personal information longer than 
  is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. </p>

  <p>The Kabalarian Philosophy web site uses cookies. Cookies help us provide a better 
  user experience by measuring which web site areas are of greatest interest.

  <h3> Children's Privacy</h3>
 
<p> We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 
  13 without parental approval. If we learn that we have personal information 
  on a child under the age of 13 without parental approval, we will delete that 
  information from our systems. The Kabalarian Philosophy encourages parents to 
  go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online 
  experience safer: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Teach children never to give personal information, unless supervised by 
      a parent or responsible adult, including name, address, phone, school, etc.</li>
    <li>Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate. 
    </li>
	<li>Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.</li> 
  </ul>

   <h3>Shipping Information</h3>
   <p>Shipping companies (Fed Ex, UPS) may also need access to some of your personal 
    information. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share 
    your name and address with a shipping company. We provide these companies 
	with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested 
    service or transaction. We do not otherwise share your personal information 
    with third-parties, unless you have granted us permission to do so. </p>
	
 <h3>Legal Proceedings</h3>
   <p>We may collect and possibly share information in order to investigate, prevent, 
    or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving 
    potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the 
    Kabalarian Philosophy's terms and conditions, or as otherwise required by 
    law. We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process. We also 
    may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal 
    claims.</p>
