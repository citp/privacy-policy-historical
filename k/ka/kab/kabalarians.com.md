## Privacy Policy

We guard your privacy like it was our own! Under no circumstances is your info given, sold or shared with others. Period!

The **Kabalarian Philosophy** and the **Society of Kabalarians of Canada** have been providing Balanced Name Recommendations, Name Reports, and other services to the public for over 80 years. We are a provincially registered non-profit society. 

Our policy is that all the information you provide us is kept **strictly private and confidential** and is used **only** in preparing your Name Report™. We do not in any way sell, trade, or distribute any personal information, address, e-mail, or telephone numbers with any organizations, governments, or companies.

We protect the personal information you share with us. For example, if you make an online purchase with us, we encrypt your credit card number. Access to your personal information is limited to people who need it to do their job. 

Shipping companies (Fed Ex, UPS) may also need access to some of your personal information. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. We provide these companies with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested service or transaction. We do not otherwise share your personal information with third-parties, unless you have granted us permission to do so. 

We may collect and possibly share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Kabalarian Philosophy's terms and conditions, or as otherwise required by law. We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

The Kabalarian Philosophy encourages parents to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer: 

  * Teach children never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult, including name, address, phone, school, etc.
  * Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate. 
  * Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.
