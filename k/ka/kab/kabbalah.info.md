**Our Use of Cookies; Affiliate Party Cookies; Web Beacons**

Cookies are small files that websites save to your hard disk or to your browser's memory. We may use them to track the number of times you have visited the Website, to track the number of visitors to the Website, to determine and analyze visitors' use of the Websites, to store information that you provide such as your preferences, and to store technical information useful for your interactions with the Website.

The Website uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate the site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies are set to store an encrypted link to your account information, so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable Kabbalah.info to track and target the interests of users to enhance the experience on the site(s).

Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your computer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Website.

Our Website also may contain electronic images known as web beacons-sometimes called single-pixel gifs-that allow us to count the number of users who have visited those pages. We may include web beacons in promotional email messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

**When You Subscribe to KABBALAH.INFO Email Programs**

You can choose to receive email from us by signing up on our Website. When you sign up for email, we will send you information about our affiliated companies based on the preferences you have set. The emails we send will include special offers, promotions, updates on services offered, invitations to join other promotional programs, and notification of upcoming events. To ensure that we are providing materials of interest to you, we may monitor whether you opened a particular email and whether you have clicked on the images and/or links therein.

Our HTML-based email messages include an invisible coded sensor that is activated when the email message is opened. This sensor communicates the date and time the message was opened and, more importantly, whether your computer is capable of receiving HTML-based email. You will receive a functioning sensor only if your computer is enabled to accept HTML email.

You may unsubscribe at any time from our email programs by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email message. All unsubscribe requests will be honored within thirty (30) days. At any time, users may opt-out of Kabbalah.info correspondence by sending an email to [maillist@kbb1.com](mailto:maillist@kbb1.com)

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, personal information you provide to Kabbalah.info through the Website or any of our email subscription or mobile content delivery programs, will not be shared outside of our company and its service providers without your express permission. 

**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to secure your personal information. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and there is always some risk in transmitting information electronically. The personal information we collect is stored within databases that we control directly or through our service providers. As we deem appropriate, we use security measures consistent with industry standards, such as firewalls and encryption technology, to protect your information. However, since no security system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Of course, any information you post to any message board, discussion group, or other public posting area on our Website is available to anyone with Internet access.

We recommend that you do not disclose your account information or your password to any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.

Kabbalah.info Website contains links to affiliate websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. If you submit any personal information to an affiliate website or transact a purchase after clicking on a link from Kabbalah.info Website, you are not submitting that information to Kabbalah.info and Kabbalah.info has no control over the collection and/or disclosure of that submitted information. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to familiarize themselves with the privacy statements of every website that collects personally information.

**Children's Privacy**

We do not seek or knowingly collect any personal information about children under 13 years of age. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database. It is our policy to endorse the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and to use our best efforts to comply with that Act.

Kabbalah.info does not sell, trade, give away, or rent personal or company information, including email address, to any outside parties in ways other than disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
