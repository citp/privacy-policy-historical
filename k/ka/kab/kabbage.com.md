## Kabbage Privacy Policy

##### August 9th, 2019

  * ## General

Kabbage, Inc. (“ _Kabbage_ ”), its affiliates, and subsidiaries (collectively, “ _we_ ”, “ _us_ ” and “ _our_ ”) provide this Privacy Policy to the website visitors, users, and businesses that access services provided by or through Kabbage (collectively, “ _you_ ” or “ _your_ ”). This Privacy Policy applies when you access or use [www.kabbage.com](https://www.kabbage.com/) or any other website or application that links to or directly provides this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “ _Sites_ ”) and describes how we collect, store, use, share, and protect information about you to operate the Sites and make available business financial products and services (collectively with the Sites, the “ _Services_ ”). This Privacy Policy also describes your choices regarding certain information we collect about you. The terms of this Privacy Policy are incorporated into the Kabbage Terms of Service.

If you apply for or obtain a financial product or service where we function as a service provider for our bank partners, such as a _Kabbage_ ® Small Business Loan offered by Celtic Bank Corporation, any information that we collect from and about you will be on behalf of the bank partner.

  * ## The USA Patriot Act

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING AN ACCOUNT

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism, money laundering activities and other financial crimes, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.

What this means for you: When you obtain a financial product or service offered by or in connection with our relationship with a financial institution, we may ask for your name, mailing address and other information or documentation, such as a copy of your driver’s license or other identifying documents, to verify your identity and otherwise comply with the applicable federal laws and regulations.

* * *

  * ## Information Collected

In connection with your use of the Services, we collect three types of information about you: Business Information, User Information, and General Information. Information from any of these categories may be linked with other information that we collect about you.  


    1.  _Business Information_. Business Information includes information regarding businesses that use or otherwise access the Services (“ _Customers_ ”). Business Information may also include information about your customers (i.e., businesses that have a commercial relationship or otherwise transact with Customers) if collected in connection with such Customer’s use or access of the Services. Business Information includes, but is not limited to (i) business name, address, email, and telephone number, (ii) company structure, (iii) industry type, (iv) incorporation date, (v) annual revenue, (vi) bank account information (e.g., average bank balance, bank statements, credit card statements), (vii) marketplace account information (e.g., transactions on PayPal, Shopify, Amazon), (viii) payment information (e.g., payment history, merchant category code, payment card number), (ix) business social network data (e.g., likes, posts, followers), (x) accounting information (e.g., Quickbooks), (x) vendor usage information (e.g., MailChimp), (xi) information regarding our transactions and experiences with the business, and (xiii) beneficial ownership information.

In the U.S., federal law requires us to collect and verify beneficial ownership information of our Customers. We collect this information to protect the U.S. financial system from financial crimes like money laundering, tax evasion, corruption, and fraud. Requiring the disclosure of key individuals who ultimately own or control the business helps law enforcement investigate and prosecute financial crimes. We will collect and maintain beneficial ownership information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

User Information includes information about the owners, principals, and business representatives, such as: name, job title, user name(s), mailing address, email address, primary telephone number, date of birth, social security number, and FICO score.
