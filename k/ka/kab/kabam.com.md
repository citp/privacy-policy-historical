As another example, your personal data may be retained to fulfill our legitimate interests such as resolving disputes or enforcing our Terms of Service or other policies, or as necessitated by law or legal considerations, such as for tax, auditing, fraud detection, maintain marketing suppression lists of transactional history. When retention is necessary, we will de-identify such personal data to the extent reasonably possible. When retention is no longer needed to fulfill the processing purposes, your personal data is deleted from our records.
