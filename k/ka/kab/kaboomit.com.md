KaboomIt, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.KaboomIt.com. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. We use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and e-mail address), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

This site contains links to other sites. KaboomIt, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's financial information (like their account or credit card numbers) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for our service. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

KaboomIt, Inc. does not disclose or disseminate any user personal or account information to any third parties. 

This site makes forums available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. 

Security Access - KaboomIt has all usage and all object accesses audited continuously and will immediately cancel the offending account and will forward the issue to the appropriate authorities if, at KaboomIt's discretion, the attempt represents either a theft of electronic services or any type of other crime. 

SSL - In order to protect electronic transactions, several security mechanisms have been proposed to deal with transferring information between computers in a secure manner. These security mechanisms attempt to insure that information such as credit card numbers can be sent without fear that someone else will intercept the data and look at it or alter it. 

KaboomIt utilizes one such security protocol - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Secure HTTP (S-HTTP). The SSL protocol has been developed by the [Netscape Corporation](http://www.netscape.com/). It provides a security layer throughout almost all layers of a network data transmission, so it can be used with FTP, Telnet, smtp, although it is most commonly used on a web page to accept data such as credit card numbers. We suggest that clients looking for security rely on this protocol to protect their web page communications. 

KaboomIt, Inc. respects and encourages parents to monitor their children's use of the Internet as a whole, and KaboomIt in particular. We want parents to be able to share the KaboomIt experience with their entire families. Although we engage in strict data and posting integrity search routines, we realize that some information presented may not be suitable for children. We are making every effort to make this a family oriented site through this diligence. Also, we as a company reserve the right to deny or revoke any posting of an item or service for any reason at our sole discretion.
