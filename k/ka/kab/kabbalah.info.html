We collect this type of information to serve you better when you provide it to us, but we do not rent or sell your information to third parties. We do not affiliate ourselves with any third party program and/or organization. We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies. From time to time, we may ask if you are interested in receiving information from third parties whose services or information we think would be of value to you. In those instances, we will only disclose your email address or other personal information to third parties <strong>if you expressly consent to such disclosure</strong>.</p>
<p><br><strong>Our Collection of Information</strong></p>

<p>In certain instances, other demographic data may be collected. Kabbalah.info uses this information to provide benefits and/or services associated with its various programs or features and Kabbalah.info uses such information to further improve user experience.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong></p>
<p>We may collect information about your visit to the Website, including what pages you view, the number of bytes transferred, the links you click, the materials you access, and other actions taken within the Website. We may also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your Internet Protocol address, your browser type and capabilities and language, your operating system, the date and time you access the Websites, and the website from which you linked to our Websites. From time to time, we may use this information to improve user experience, optimize promotional offers of products and/or services.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kabbalah.info and/or our service providers may collect your click-stream data and other preference information. We do this to improve the design of the Website.

Your preference data includes reminder, search, and other information-related information that you submit to the site.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Use of Information</strong></p>
<p>In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions with Kabbalah.info, information collected via the Website may be combined with information we collect by other means. We may also use your personal information to improve the Website, to optimize our offers of products and/or services, or to make the Website easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Website to your particular preference or interests.</p>
<p>If you have chosen to receive communications by email from us but later wish to opt-out of receiving such communications from us at any time, simply follow the instructions for doing so included in the emails.</p>
<p>If you would like to opt-out of receiving any program-related and other direct mail from us, please send a written request to:<br>In Unites States of America please write to:</p>
<p>Bnei Baruch USA<br>2009 85th Street, Suite 51<br>Brooklyn, NY 11214<br>E-mail: maillist@kbb1.com</p>
<p>In Canada please write to:<br>Bnei Baruch Canada<br>3701 Chesswood Drive, Suite 216,<br>Toronto, Ontario M3J 2P6<br>E-mail: maillist@kbb1.com</p>
<p>We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Website, or any of our email subscription or mobile content delivery programs, such as service announcements or similar administrative or transactional messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Use of Cookies; Affiliate Party Cookies; Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small files that websites save to your hard disk or to your browser's memory. We may use them to track the number of times you have visited the Website, to track the number of visitors to the Website, to determine and analyze visitors' use of the Websites, to store information that you provide such as your preferences, and to store technical information useful for your interactions with the Website.</p>
<p>The Website uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate the site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies are set to store an encrypted link to your account information, so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable Kabbalah.info to track and target the interests of users to enhance the experience on the site(s).</p>
<p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your computer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Website.</p>
<p>Our Website also may contain electronic images known as web beacons-sometimes called single-pixel gifs-that allow us to count the number of users who have visited those pages. We may include web beacons in promotional email messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>When You Subscribe to KABBALAH.INFO Email Programs</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to receive email from us by signing up on our Website. When you sign up for email, we will send you information about our affiliated companies based on the preferences you have set. The emails we send will include special offers, promotions, updates on services offered, invitations to join other promotional programs, and notification of upcoming events. To ensure that we are providing materials of interest to you, we may monitor whether you opened a particular email and whether you have clicked on the images and/or links therein.</p>
<p>Our HTML-based email messages include an invisible coded sensor that is activated when the email message is opened. This sensor communicates the date and time the message was opened and, more importantly, whether your computer is capable of receiving HTML-based email. You will receive a functioning sensor only if your computer is enabled to accept HTML email.</p>
<p>You may unsubscribe at any time from our email programs by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email message. All unsubscribe requests will be honored within thirty (30) days. At any time, users may opt-out of Kabbalah.info correspondence by sending an email to maillist@kbb1.com<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, personal information you provide to Kabbalah.info through the Website or any of our email subscription or mobile content delivery programs, will not be shared outside of our company and its service providers without your express permission. <br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Security </strong></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to secure your personal information. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and there is always some risk in transmitting information electronically. The personal information we collect is stored within databases that we control directly or through our service providers. As we deem appropriate, we use security measures consistent with industry standards, such as firewalls and encryption technology, to protect your information. However, since no security system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Of course, any information you post to any message board, discussion group, or other public posting area on our Website is available to anyone with Internet access.</p>
<p>We recommend that you do not disclose your account information or your password to any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
<p>Kabbalah.info Website contains links to affiliate websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. If you submit any personal information to an affiliate website or transact a purchase after clicking on a link from Kabbalah.info Website, you are not submitting that information to Kabbalah.info and Kabbalah.info has no control over the collection and/or disclosure of that submitted information. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to familiarize themselves with the privacy statements of every website that collects personally information.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Children's Privacy </strong></p>
<p>We do not seek or knowingly collect any personal information about children under 13 years of age. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>In Summary </strong></p>
<p>Kabbalah.info is committed to protecting your privacy. Kabbalah.info does not sell, trade, give away, or rent personal or company information, including email address, to any outside parties in ways other than disclosed in this Privacy Policy. Kabbalah.info uses the information collected on the site to make promotional activities possible and to enhance your overall experience with our Website.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Governing Law; Visitors Residing Outside the United States</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy and the privacy practices of Kabbalah.info will be subject exclusively to the laws of the State of New York within the United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

We encourage you to check this page periodically for any updates. Your continued use of the Websites following the posting of updates to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those updates.<br><strong></strong></p>
