# Kami - Privacy

Effective: April 5th, 2014

Thanks for using Kami! Here we describe how we collect, use and handle your information when you use our websites, software and services ("Services").

**What & Why**

We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect our Services:

**Account.** We collect, and associate with your account, information like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address. Some of our services let you access your accounts and your information with other service providers.

**Services.** When you use our Services, we store, process and transmit your files and information related to them (for example, your annotations ). If you give us access to your contacts, we'll store those contacts on our servers for you to use. This will make it easy for you to do things like share your stuff, send emails, and invite others to use the Services.

**Usage.** We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.

**Cookies and other technologies.** We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.

**With whom**

We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other third-parties.

**Others working for Kami.** Kami uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

**Other users.** Our Services display information like your name and email address to other users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications. Certain features let you make additional information available to other users.

**Other applications.** You can also give third parties access to your information and account - for example, via Kami APIs. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.

**Law & Order.** We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Kami or our users; or (d) protect Kami’s property rights.

Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that our users' data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it's stored on our services or on their home computer's hard drive. We'll abide by our principles when receiving, scrutinizing and responding to government requests for our users' data:

  * Be transparent,
  * Fight blanket requests,
  * Protect all users, and
  * Provide trusted services.



**How**

**Security.** We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe.

**Retention.** We'll retain information you store on our Services for as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we'll also delete this information. But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.
