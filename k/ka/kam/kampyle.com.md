## General Information

**1\. Opting Out / Unsubscribe.** You may choose not to receive future promotional, advertising, or other Service-related emails from Kampyle by selecting an unsubscribe link at the bottom of emails that we send. Even if you opt out of receiving the foregoing emails, we may still send a response to any “Contact Us” or Demo Request as well as administrative emails that are necessary to facilitate your use of the Service. As to unsubscribing from our Clients communications: our Clients are exclusively responsible for their own marketing emails and other communications. We have no way to unsubscribe you from their communications. Normally, you can unsubscribe from our Clients communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of their emails, or by contacting them directly.

**2\. Choice.** At all times, you may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Information. The notices that we provide on the Service in circumstances where we collect Personal Information should help to make this choice. If you choose not to provide Personal Information that we request, you may still use parts of the Service, but may be unable to access certain options, programs, offers, and services that require such Personal Information.

**3\. Access/Accuracy.** To the extent that we collect and store Personal Information, we wish to maintain accurate Personal Information. If you are a Client or a Website Visitor then you may use the tools that we make available on the Website to remove or modify certain information in your Account or Public Profile. If you are a Feedback Form Participant on Kampyle’s Website or SaaS Product Client and you would like to amend or correct a material inaccuracy in any of your Personal Information that we may be storing, you may submit an access request by sending an email to [info [a] kampyle.com](mailto:info@kampyle.com). The email should include adequate details to permit us to handle the request.

When you contact us, please include your email address, name, and contact details and clearly describe your complaint. We will respond to your complaint as soon as reasonably practicable, by making contact with you to inform you whether we have accepted your complaint, need further information or do not think we are in breach.

If you are not satisfied with our response to your complaint, at any time, you may refer your complaint to any relevant agency or authority (e.g. in Australia – the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (www.oaic.gov.au))

**5\. Links and Re-Directing to Other Sites.** The Website may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by us. In addition, if activated by our Client, our Feedback Forms may include links redirecting you to additional content on our Client’s website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third party websites, and you visit them at your own risk.

**6\. Children’s Privacy.** The Service is not structured to attract children under the age of 13. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under the age of 13, please contact us at [info [a] kampyle.com](mailto:info@kampyle.com)

Kampyle is a ISO27001:2005 Information Security Standard accredited, and we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. All data collected during a feedback submission is encrypted during transmission. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

We do not allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumers online activities over time and across different web sites when a consumer uses the Site.

**11\. Commitment.** We are committed to protecting your privacy. If you have any comments or questions regarding our Privacy Policy, or Personal Information that we may be storing and using, please contact us at: [info [a] kampyle.com](mailto:info@kampyle.com).
