# Privacy Policy

If you visit an area of the website where you are not required to log on, to read, browse or download information, our system will record the date and time of your visit to our site, the pages viewed and any information downloaded. However, our system will not record any personally identifiable information about you without your consent.

If you complete an online form on our website, the information that you enter on that form will only be collected if you actually submit the form to us. If you change your mind and do not submit the information, any information you have entered up to that point will not be collected by our system and will be discarded (note that if your browser has an “auto complete” function, it might automatically fill in the form again the next time you visit that page).

Any personal information that you actually submit to us using our website or in an email will only be used for the following purposes:

Your personal information will only be added to our customer database (to be used for purposes other than answering your specific request) if you opt in to receive communications or if you join our Summit Club. Your membership of the Summit Club may be governed by separate terms and conditions.

If you choose to use the Services and submit information to us about you for that purpose, you will be taken as authorising us to collect, use, store and disclose that information in the manner and for the purposes contemplated by these Terms. If you choose not to provide all of the personal information that we request from you, the Services you request may not be available to you.

If you provide us with personal information about you, you should advise us if the information changes, so we can update our records. You can either [update it online](https://web.archive.org/customer/account/create "My Account") or via [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contacts/index "Contact Us"). We may contact you from time to time to check that information we hold is still accurate.

The personal information that we collect about you is stored on our database server managed by Kathmandu Limited in Christchurch, New Zealand, and its collection, storage, use and disclosure is governed by the terms of the New Zealand Privacy Act 1993.

We may disclose personal information that we collect and retain about you to third parties but only for the purposes identified in these Terms or to which you have consented, or when we are required to do so by law. If we provide any contact details to our contracted suppliers who are responsible for processing our mail-outs, we require those suppliers to agree to use the information only to fulfil that purpose, and not to retain the details once that purpose has been fulfilled.

Under the Privacy Act 1993 (New Zealand), you have certain rights to access and request correction of your personal information held by us. Any such request, or any inquiry, should be sent to the following address: Group Online Manager, Kathmandu Ltd, PO Box 984, South Melbourne 3205, Victoria, Australia.

We may at any time disclose your personal information including, without limitation, your name and contact details to any relevant authorities, parties and/or applicable intellectual property right holders (or their representatives) if we consider that you are in breach of these Terms and that disclosure is required for those parties to enforce their rights.

If you subscribe to a mailing list that we maintain (including an email subscription list), you can ask us to remove you from that list at any time by using the “unsubscribe” facility referred to in our message to you, or sending us an email with your details via [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contacts/index "Contact Us"). We will comply with that request as soon as we reasonably can. However you should understand that sometimes we may have begun distributing a mail-out before we can process that request, and in those circumstances you might still receive that mail-out.

If you have accessed Third Party Websites through this website and if the operators of those Third Party Websites collect information about you, we may also collect or have access to that information as part of our arrangements with those third parties.

Where you access a Third Party Website from this website, cookie information, information about your preferences or other information you have provided about yourself may be shared between us and the third party. You usually cannot be identified from the information that is shared. If you can be identified from this information, we will seek your consent before sharing the information.

Third Party Websites should contain their own privacy statements and the operators of those Third Party Websites are responsible for their own privacy practices.

Kathmandu has implemented and uses Display Advertising. Kathmandu uses Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show Kathmandu ads on sites across the Internet. Kathmandu and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Kathmandu website.

We will save any email that you send us, if we believe that we have a legal or business requirement to do so. We may monitor email message content for security issues including where e-mail abuse is suspected.  
If you have a dispute with us or want to know more about privacy issues in Australia, we encourage you to visit the Australian Office of The Privacy Commissioner’s website at [www.privacy.gov.au](http://www.privacy.gov.au/ "Privacy.gov.au").
