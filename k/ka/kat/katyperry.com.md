Such staff may be engaged in, among other things: preparing and sending newsletters to which you subscribe, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of payment details and the provision of support services. Not all countries legislate for the same levels of protection of personal data as your home country, particularly if you are resident in the EEA. By submitting data, you agree to this collection, transfer, storing or processing of data about you for the purposes described in this policy. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure data about you is treated securely in accordance with this policy, and all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of our service providers.

All promotional information from us will come with instructions on how to opt-out from receiving further information in the future.

 **Data over the Internet and other websites**

We want you to know that if you provide us with data over the Internet, this is at your own risk. By using the Website, you agree to and authorise us to process data in this way. However, please be assured that we do use commercially reasonable procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access to your data.
