**Disclosures:**

As a lover of all things healthy and fun, I often review products and events, not only for my own research, but to share my opinions with others. They are just that — opinions.

From time to time, companies will send me products to try, free of cost. Also, when I compete at events (triathlons, races, etc) I often receive free samples of foods, drinks or other products.

**Whenever I review or refer to a product that was provided to me, I will make it clear in the post.** I provide not only details of how I received the product, but I often link to the company itself. My reviews are honest, and if _ _ done at the request of a company, rest assured that the compensation of cash or product does not have any bearing on the content. If I do not like a product, I will either not review it on the blog, or I will state the reasons why I don’t like it.

_If I purchased the product, I will not necessarily state that in the post._

**From time to time, I do accept sponsored posts, for which I am paid in cash or other compensation.** When I do that, I make it clear in the post and include a link to this policy.

**As stated above, I also do use affiliate links and banners across my website.  **While I always try to make it as clear as possible, it is possible that when you click a link or a banner on my site, I may get a small commission or other compensation. The only things you’ll see me link to or recommend are products or services I’ve tried or used myself, and if you choose to click through but prefer not to use my affiliate tag, simply remove that from the web address before completing your purchase.

Also — please note that I work part-time for a company called Growing Bolder, also known as Bolder Media Group or Bolder Broadcasting, Inc. Often, I will post links to stories that my company has helped produce. When I do, I will attempt to make that clear but am not ever _paid  _to share my professional content on my personal blog or social networks.

Additionally, I run a blog coaching and consulting service called [Make Me{dia} Over](http://makemediaover.com/). From time to time, I will advertise my services here on this website.

**Questions?** Please e-mail me (kwidrick@gmail.com) or refer to the FTC’s ruling on blogger disclosure:

[FTC Rules on Sponsored Conversations](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking "FTC Rules")

_**For disclosure outside of my blog:**_

  * #AD or #sponsored: denotes that a brand has compensated me in some way for the post or message — in most cases, the message will be in my own words but may also include copy points from the client. This compensation may have been in cash or in product.



When I don’t use the #AD or #sponsored tags, I follow FTC guidelines by using clear language to let you know that something is sponsored.
