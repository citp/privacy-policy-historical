                <h3><a name="1"></a>1.  OUR APPROACH</h3>
                	<p>KCOM Group takes the privacy of its users seriously. Generally, you can browse through our Website without giving us any information about yourself (including your email address). When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.</p>
                    <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy for this Website, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.</p>
                <p><a href="#contents">back to top</a></p>
                
                <h3><a name="2"></a>2.  INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>
                	<p>We collect personal information (such as your name, email address and any other details you provide to us that identifies you as an individual) from you when you submit a request for information or when you submit your details for any other reason. Personal information will only be collected with your consent.</p>
                    <p>When you browse our Website, we may also log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our Website you visit and how long you spend here. We do not link your IP address to any other personal information that you send to us. Like many other websites, we may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the Website (see section <a href="#6">6. Cookies</a>)</p>
                    <p>Save for the use of cookies, we do not automatically log data or collect data apart from information you specifically provide to us.</p>

                <h3><a name="3"></a>3.  USE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
                	<p>We (and other KCOM Group companies) will use your information for several general purposes including: fulfilling any requests for information or services placed by you, processing any other transactions authorised by you, keeping you up to date with news about KCOM Group, our products and services, and providing other information to you which we think you may find of interest. Your personal information shall not be used for any other purposes.</p>

                <h3><a name="4"></a>4.  WHO MAY PROCESS DATA</h3>
                	<p>Your personal information may be processed both by us and by other companies within our group in accordance with this privacy policy. We take all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal data. Personal information will not be sold or transferred to unaffiliated third parties without your prior consent.</p>
                    <p>Where any personal information is processed by us, we will comply with relevant Data Protection legislation at all times. We are registered to process data under the Data Protection Act (our registration number is D1303069) and you may refer to the Data Protection Register website for further information at <a href="http://www.dpr.gov.uk" title="Data Protection Register" target="_blank">http://www.dpr.gov.uk</a>.</p>

                <h3><a name="5"></a>5.  SECURITY MEASURES</h3>
                	<p>We are serious about guarding the security of your personal information that we have under our control from unauthorised access, improper use and disclosure, unauthorised destruction or accidental loss. However we cannot guarantee the protection of your personal data as due to the nature of the Internet, the Website is theoretically accessible by any user of the World Wide Web.

                <h3><a name="6"></a>6.  COOKIES</h3>
                	<p><strong>6.1 What is a cookie? </strong></p>
			
			<p>A cookie is a small text file that may be placed on your computers hard-drive when you visit a website so that the site can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.  Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you.  The only personal information a cookie can contain is the information that you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data from your hard disk or read any other cookie files created by other websites. </p>
			
			<p>You can find more information on cookies, their use and your rights, if you visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" title="www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>. </p>
			
			<p><strong>6.2 How we use cookies </strong></p>
            
            <p>We use cookies in order to help personalise your experience on our site.</p>
            
            <p><strong>6.2.1 Third Party Cookies</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Website Statistics</strong></p>
            <p>We also use cookies which are generated by a third party to enable us to track user trends in association with web beacons (see section <a href="#7">7. What is a web beacon?</a>) to ensure the website is structured in a user friendly manner. The cookies that are issued merely contain a unique number and therefore contain no personal data. They have a lifetime of 5 years.</p>
             
            <p><strong>Online Advertising</strong></p>  
            <p>Our website may contain third party advertising and sponsorship. It is possible that these third party advertisers may download third party cookies to your computer. These cookies are used for website and advertising optimisation.</p>
            <p>The cookie usually contains a meaningless user id (a unique random number) so that the user can be distinguished from any other user. No personal user information can be stored in a third party cookie for a simple reason: such information is not available to the third party server.</p>
            <p>The lifetime of these cookies is set by the server. By the nature of these third party cookies, they are temporary, their lifetime varying anywhere from the time you spend on the site to one day to one month to one year. After the cookie expiration date, it is deleted by the browser automatically.</p>
            <p>You are not obliged to accept cookies and by modifying the settings in your browser, you may opt to accept cookies, to be informed when a cookie is being placed on your PC or to reject all cookies.  (see section <a href="#6.3">6.3 How to disable cookies</a>)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
