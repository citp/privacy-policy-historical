#### 1\. Our approach

HEYToday takes privacy seriously. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself (including your email address).

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
