### 6\. COOKIES

**6.1 What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small text file that may be placed on your computers hard-drive when you visit a website so that the site can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you. The only personal information a cookie can contain is the information that you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data from your hard disk or read any other cookie files created by other websites. 

You can find more information on cookies, their use and your rights, if you visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>. 

**6.2 How we use cookies**

We use cookies in order to help personalise your experience on our site.

**6.2.1 Third Party Cookies**

**Website Statistics**

We also use cookies which are generated by a third party to enable us to track user trends in association with web beacons (see section 7\. What is a web beacon?) to ensure the website is structured in a user friendly manner. The cookies that are issued merely contain a unique number and therefore contain no personal data. They have a lifetime of 5 years.

**Online Advertising**

Our website may contain third party advertising and sponsorship. It is possible that these third party advertisers may download third party cookies to your computer. These cookies are used for website and advertising optimisation.

The cookie usually contains a meaningless user id (a unique random number) so that the user can be distinguished from any other user. No personal user information can be stored in a third party cookie for a simple reason: such information is not available to the third party server.

The lifetime of these cookies is set by the server. By the nature of these third party cookies, they are temporary, their lifetime varying anywhere from the time you spend on the site to one day to one month to one year. After the cookie expiration date, it is deleted by the browser automatically.

You are not obliged to accept cookies and by modifying the settings in your browser, you may opt to accept cookies, to be informed when a cookie is being placed on your PC or to reject all cookies. (see section 6.3 How to disable cookies)  

**6.3 How to disable cookies**

The popular browsers Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) allow some level of cookie verification or choice. This way you can voluntarily choose not to visit a site or areas of a site that use cookies.

You can find out how to manage cookies for your browser here <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/>
