        <h2>Protecting your privacy on our web site</h2>

        <h3>What this privacy policy covers</h3>
  
    <p>
        This privacy policy pertains to the use of the Kareo web site at <a href="/">kareo.com</a>. This privacy policy covers how Kareo 
        treats personal information that Kareo collects and receives. Personal information is information about you that is personally 
        identifiable like your name, address, email address or phone number. Children under 13 are not permitted to use the Kareo service, 
        and so this privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of the site.
    </p>

    <div class="trustblock">
        <a href="http://clicktoverify.truste.com/pvr.php?page=validate&amp;url=www.kareo.com&amp;sealid=101" target="_blank">
            <img src="/img/badge-truste_seal.png" alt="TRUSTe Certified Privacy">
        </a>
    </div>
    <p>
        Kareo is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, organization whose mission is to build user’s trust 
        and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its 
        commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Kareo by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@kareo.com">privacy@kareo.com</a>. 
        If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at 
        their <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=www.kareo.com">Feedback and Resolution</a> page. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.
    </p>

    <p>
        The TRUSTe program only covers information that is collected through this web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through any software downloaded from this web site.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Information collection and how it is used</h3>
  
    <p><strong>General Information</strong></p>
    <p>
        You do not have to give us any personal information to visit the product information portion of our web site. No personally identifying information (such as your name, 
        e-mail address or Social Security number) will be collected unless you choose to provide that information to us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kareo collects personal information when you sign up for a trial or paid subscription to the Kareo service. When you sign up, we ask for your name, email address, 
        phone number and your company's demographic and financial information.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you sign up for a paid subscription, we will ask you to enter your credit card or ACH information. This information is encrypted on computer systems that 
        are secured in a locked cage at a data center co-location facility rented by Kareo.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kareo automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address and the page you request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kareo uses information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kareo will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, 
        we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe by clicking on the link within the email.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you sign up for Kareo Patient Portal and elect to use the online patient payment service, your transaction will be processed by Stripe, Inc., and the information you provide to Stripe is subject to its privacy policy. 
        Your credit card number and billing information will not be accessible by Kareo.
    </p>

    <p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>
    <p>
        IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page or use our service. Your IP address is not permanently stored in a way that is identified with your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.</li>
        <li>To estimate the total number of users visiting Kareo from specific geographical regions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
        A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
        Kareo uses a "session" cookie that will get removed automatically when you close your web browser. We have cookies on our site but the data is only collected in the aggregate. We use a third-party 
        tracking services that uses cookies and other tracking technologies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third parties also place browser plug-in cookies on our site, including Flash cookies, also known as "local shared objects," to perform similar functions as browser cookies. Like normal browser cookies, 
        these cookies are represented as small files stored on your computer. One method of preventing Flash cookies from being placed is to adjust your preferences in the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings 
        Panel at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">macromedia.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Protected Health Information</strong></p>
    <p>
        When using the web site, you will never provide Kareo with Protected Health Information (PHI), nor will Kareo show any PHI.
    </p>

    <h3>Information sharing and disclosure</h3>
  
    <p>
        Kareo may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Kareo Terms of Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kareo may share demographic information with business partners, such as "7% of Kareo customers are in the Los Angeles region" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever 
        be used without your permission (i.e., we will ask you before using a quote or testimonial).
    </p>
    <p>
        Third party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites on the Internet. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website. 
        Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the <a target="new" href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google advertising opt-out page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kareo does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies for promotional purposes except to provide products or services you've requested or when we have your permission.
    </p>
    <p>
        With your consent, we do share your name and email with carefully selected partners. If you would not like your information shared with these partners, 
        uncheck the box when asked this option or notify us via <a href="mailto:privacy@kareo.com">privacy@kareo.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the 
        physical safety of any person, violations of Kareo's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will transfer information about you if Kareo is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Kareo will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Kareo 
        web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use other third parties such as a chat service provider to provide customer service to you, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, an email service 
        provider to send out emails on our behalf. When you sign up for these services, we will specify what personally identifiable information is being shared as necessary for the third party to provide that service.
    </p>
  

    <h3>Accessing, updating, or correcting your personal information</h3>
    <p>
        If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct it by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.
    </p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as credit card number on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information 
        using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
    </p>
    <p>
        We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the 
        Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>

    <h3>Customer testimonials, comments and reviews</h3>
    <p>
        We post customer testimonials, comments and reviews on our web site which may contain personal information. These testimonials are publicly available from a partner site and we post them on our policy. 
        We do obtain the customer's consent to post their name along with their testimonial via email prior to posting the testimonial.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should be aware that any personal information you submit on blogs on this site and others can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. 
        We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Links to other sites</h3>
    <p>
        If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave this site and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of 
        your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as us. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any 
        other service provider from whom you request services.
    </p>

    <h3>Changes to this privacy policy</h3>
    <p>
        Kareo may update this policy at any time for any reason. If there are any significant changes to how we handle personal information we will send a notice to the contact email address specified in 
        your company's Kareo account or by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our site.
    </p>
