## § 1 Collection, use and storage of personal data

If you use Kärcher's online offer, Kärcher collects various data from you, in some cases also so-called personal data. This is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter referred to as "data subject").

### 1\. Visiting the Kärcher websites in general

When visiting the Kärcher websites, you transmit data to our web server via your Internet browser (for technical reasons). The following data is recorded during a running connection for communication between your Internet browser and our web server:

  * Date and time of the request

  * Page from which the file was requested
  * Access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)
  * Web browser and operating system used
  * Complete IP address of the requesting computer
  * Transferred data volume



For reasons of technical security, in particular to prevent attempts to attack our web server, these data are temporarily stored by us. It is not possible for us to draw conclusions about individual persons on the basis of this data.

Legal basis of the storage is § 15 TMG (German Telemedia Act) and Article 6 lit. f) GDPR.

Further personal information is only collected if it is freely given, for example as part of an inquiry or registration. Depending on the area concerned, Kärcher uses the personal data you provide to answer your enquiries, to process your order and for the purpose of technical administration of the websites. In detail, the use in the respective areas follows as follows:

### 2\. Contact forms

If you contact Kärcher via a contact form on the Kärcher website, the data you provide will be stored so that your message can be forwarded to the correct contact person. This is done in accordance with Article 6 lit b) GDPR for processing your request. Your data provided via a contact form will not be used for any other purposes, especially not for advertising. After answering your inquiry we will delete your inquiry and the related personal data.

### 3\. Market research (e.g. Register&Win)

Within the statutory framework Kärcher uses your data for market research purposes and if you have expressly given your consent by ticking the checkbox next to the following text:

"I am interested in further surveys via phone or e-mail in the context of Kärcher’s market research!"

As part of "Register&Win" or other market research activities, Kärcher stores your salutation, your name, your address, your e-mail address, your telephone number, the area to which you assign yourself (private or commercial) and - if you have filled in these fields or ticked the box - your year of birth as well as the part number, the product name, the date of purchase of your Kärcher product and that you are interested in further market research surveys. Kärcher will only use your data for market research in accordance with Article 6 lit a) GDPR if you have given your consent by ticking the appropriate box. Otherwise, your data will be used exclusively for your information in the event of a win pursuant to Article 6 lit b) GDPR.

### 4\. Applications at Kärcher

To process your application the personal date you have provided will be used and processed according to Article 6 lit b) GDPR and § 26 BDSG.

The application process at Kärcher is supported by interpool Personal GmbH, Berliner Allee 24, 13088 Berlin which will also get access to your personal data.

## § 2 Transfer and deletion of personal data

### 1\. Visiting the Kärcher websites

The data stored when merely visiting the Kärcher websites (§ 1) will not be passed on to third parties.

### 2\. Contact form

Only if your inquiry or comment is made to another company of the Kärcher-group other than the company whose contact form you have used, your message and the associated data will be transmitted to the correct contact person within the correct company. The data you have entered in a Kärcher online contact form will not be passed on to other third parties unless you are specifically notified of this.

### 3\. Transmission to authorities and other public bodies

Your data will only be passed on to third parties outside the Kärcher-group, if the responsible public authority or state institution orders its disclosure in individual cases, then Kärcher is obliged to do so.

### 4\. Market research

## § 3 Security note

### 1\. General technical and organizational measures:

Kärcher has taken a variety of security measures to adequately protect personal information.

All data stored at Kärcher is protected by physical and technical measures as well as procedural measures that restrict access to the information to specially authorized persons in accordance with this data protection declaration.

The Kärcher websites are located behind a software firewall to prevent access from other networks connected to the Internet. In addition, only employees who need the information to perform a specific task will have access to personal information. These employees are trained in security and privacy practices and will keep your information confidential.

### 2\. Secure data transmission

The transmission of your personal data within the framework of an order process in the online shop is encrypted using the industry standard Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology (SSL encryption version 3). 

## § 4 Cookies / usage-related advertising (behavioural advertising)

Pursuant to § 15 Section 3 TMG and Article 6 lit f) GDPR, Kärcher creates user profiles for purposes of advertising, market research or for the demand-oriented design of Kärcher websites, provided the user does not object to this. Their possibility of objection is described in the individual technical measures.

### 1\. Use of cookies

"Cookies" are used for behavioural targeting on our website. These are text files by means of which data containing usage information (websites visited, number of visits, visiting times, length of stay on individual pages, etc.), i.e. usage profiles, are stored on your hard disk. These user profiles are anonymized and evaluated in a technical (statistical) evaluation procedure, in order to enable a selection related to the interests of the respective user when Internet advertising (e.g. banners) is uploaded to other websites. In no case personal data such as name, address, e-mail address are stored in the cookies.

### 2\. Behavioural Advertising

The IP address is collected directly from the service provider of behavioural targeting - on the Kärcher websites this is the GroupM Competence Center GmbH - but only stored and further processed there either in shortened or encrypted form (i.e. replaced by another sequence of numbers that does not allow any conclusions about the original IP number sequence and cannot be traced back again). GroupM Competence Center GmbH also offers advertising for websites of other providers and uses its targeting systems to select the collected data for the purpose of user-oriented advertising. Further information on data protection and behavioural targeting of GroupM Competence Center GmbH and its technology can be found at <http://www.xaxis.com/de/page/privacy-policy/>. There you can also object to the anonymous analysis of your surfing behaviour.
