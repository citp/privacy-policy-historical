<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<hr>
<div style="font-size: 12px;">
This is KaraokePlay ("KaraokePlay," "we" or “us”) online Privacy Policy for all  websites owned or controlled by KaraokePlay (except as otherwise provided on such  site), including www.KaraokePlay.com, and for the Service and Materials provided  by KaraokePlay (except as otherwise indicated in such Service or Materials). This  policy applies only to information gathered through the Service, including the  use of Materials through the Service, but not to other off-line transactions  with KaraokePlay, nor to transactions with any third party not owned or controlled  by KaraokePlay. By using the Service, and by checking the box indicating agreement  with the Terms of Use during registration, you agree to accept the practices  and terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms not defined in  this policy shall have the meaning set forth in the KaraokePlay Terms of Use  Agreement. <strong></strong>
      <p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children</strong></p>
      <p>KaraokePlay does not knowingly collect personal  information from children under the age of 13. KaraokePlay requests that children  under the age of 13 not use the Service nor submit any personal information to  the Service. Since information regarding children under the age of 13 is not  collected, KaraokePlay does not knowingly use or distribute personal information  regarding children under the age of 13. If KaraokePlay obtains actual knowledge  that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13,  that information will be immediately deleted from our database.</p>
      <p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally Identifiable Information You Provide</strong></p>

      <p>You may also be asked to provide personally  identifiable information in order to use certain Services and to obtain support  from KaraokePlay. This information may include your name, address, telephone  number, credit card number (for paid Services), e-mail address and instant  messenger user/screen name, as well as the e-mail addresses,  user/screen name and telephone numbers of those to whom you send content. Other  Users may also provide us with your e-mail address, user/screen name, or  telephone number in order to send you content. If you do not want to provide  KaraokePlay with any personally identifiable information, you should not use the  Services that require such information.</p>
      <p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Personally identifiable and Aggregate Information</strong></p>
      <p>The non-personally identifiable information that we  may gather includes your gender, age, zip code, country or territory of  residence, IP address, the type of browser that you use, the type and nature of  the content that you upload to the Service and access from the Service, the  comments and communication that you enter into the Service, the links and  transactions with us and with third-parties that you enter into via the  Service, and other aspects of your use of the Service. KaraokePlay uses this  information to improve the Service, conduct research, to analyze your and other  User’s interest in the areas of the Service, to tailor advertising and content  displayed to you and other Users, to inform our suppliers about the use of the  Service, and to inform our advertisers about the number of Users that have  viewed their advertising. To do this we may combine information that we have  about you with information that we obtain from business partners or other  companies. We may also release aggregate demographic information about User  trends to partners and other third parties, including third-party advertisers  on the Service. An example of this type of information would be patterns of use  of the Service based on zip code or age group. We also retain aggregated log  files of requested content in order to report overall product usage to content  partners and to evaluate User trends.</p>
      <p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use and Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

      <p>KaraokePlay does not rent or sell personally  identifiable information, such as your name or e-mail address, to  advertisers.&nbsp; KaraokePlay may use your  personally identifiable information:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To  deliver you the Service and send you notices related to the Service, your  Account and necessary updates. This includes fulfilling your requests for  products and services and delivering content to you that is sent by other  Users.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To  deliver your content to other Users (we will share your User name with Users to  whom you send content). If you do not want to share this information, you  should limit the content that you share and the Users that you share it with.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To  e-mail you our newsletter, promotions and special offers from us and our  partners. You may remove yourself from this list at any time by clicking on the  appropriate unsubscribe button in the e-mail that we send to you.<br>

        * To manage your Account and Account access, provide  you with Software and Materials, purchase confirmations, support and customer  service and to keep track of support and customer service requests.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* To provide you with information concerning  promotions and sweepstakes that you enter (see below for more details).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To  determine the technical capabilities of your device and the appropriate content  to deliver to you.</p>
      <p>KaraokePlay may disclose personally identifiable  information to its partners in order to provide the Service, resolve service  problems and correct errors in the Service (including customer inquiries,  billing and credit corrections), to communicate with you about the Service, to  provide you with advertising and promotional information in connection with the  Service, and to enhance your experience on the Service. However, these  companies do not have an independent right to share this information. Due to  our contractual obligations with these third parties and the need to share  personally identifiable information to deliver and support the Service, we  cannot provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of sharing personally  identifiable information with these third parties.</p>
      <p>Your personally identifiable information may be  provided to a third party if KaraokePlay files for bankruptcy, or there is a  transfer of the assets or ownership of KaraokePlay. KaraokePlay may also disclose  personally identifiable information in order to respond to a subpoena, court  order or other such request, or to otherwise establish or exercise our rights,  or defend against legal claims. KaraokePlay may also provide such personally  identifiable information order to investigate, prevent and take action  regarding fraud or misuse of the Service, to comply with law or in response to  a law enforcement agency's request, to enforce our Privacy Policy and end user  agreements, and to protect the rights, property and safety of the Service,  Users and others.</p>

      <p>In addition to other Users that you designate,  KaraokePlay, its partners, and each of their contractors and employees may view  the content that you upload to the Service in order to provide the Service and  otherwise perform the tasks set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Any information that you may  reveal in your User profile, in communication with other Users or in other  online discussions or forums is intentionally open to the public and is not in  any way private. You should think carefully before publicly disclosing any  personally identifiable information. What you have written may be seen and/or  collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to  control or predict.</p>
      <p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies and Pixel Tags</strong></p>
      <p>Cookies are small bits of data that are deposited on  a User's hard drive. The Service utilizes Cookies and IP addresses for certain  functions. Cookies permit Users to store their password and other User  information without having to constantly re-enter this data. Cookies also  permit KaraokePlay and our advertisers to tailor the Service and advertising to  your needs. Some of the advertising served through the Service may be supplied  by one or more third parties who may also use cookies. In addition, we may also  record the pages you visit on our Service through the use of pixel tags (also  called “clear gifs” or “beacons”).</p>
 

      <p>If you wish to delete, modify or update any  information KaraokePlay has received, please go to the KaraokePlay Website and select  the “My Studio” link.&nbsp; <strong><em><u></u></em></strong></p>

      <p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Websites and Services</strong></p>
      <p>KaraokePlay is not responsible for the privacy policies  of websites and services to which the Service links, or of which the Service is  a part. If you provide any information to such third parties different rules  regarding the collection and use of your personal information may apply. We  strongly suggest you review such third party's privacy policies before  providing any data to them.</p>
      <p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Security</strong> <br>

        KaraokePlay takes appropriate steps to help ensure data  privacy and security including through various hardware and software  methodologies. However, due to the open nature of communication through the  Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and the Service,  and the Service and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third  parties. Users of the Service do so at their own risk. KaraokePlay cannot  guarantee the security of any information that is disclosed online.</p>

      <p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promotions and Sweepstakes</strong></p>
      <p>If you chose to enter a promotion, sweepstakes, or  contest hosted by KaraokePlay or sponsored by KaraokePlay and/or one of our partners,  we (and/or our promotional partner) may ask for your name, address, and/or email  address. You may be asked to provide additional information or to answer  certain questions, some of which may be optional, in order to participate. We  and/or our partner may contact you in connection with a particular promotion,  such as a sweepstakes or contest, in order to update you of your status,  administer the promotion, let you know that a promotion has ended, and for  other purposes. Promotions that are hosted on the Service may be sponsored by  KaraokePlay, may be co-sponsored by KaraokePlay and another company, or may be  sponsored by companies other than KaraokePlay. Some or all of the data collected  during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor(s) or companies indicated on  the entry form. We may use third-party companies to generate and manage some of  our promotional campaigns. We may share with these companies Service usage  information about those visitors to our web site who participate in the  promotional campaigns. This sharing is for the purpose of targeting future  campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics.</p>
      <p><strong>10.&nbsp; Reasonable Efforts</strong></p>
      <p>We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this  Privacy Policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any  failure to comply with our Privacy Policy. We sometimes release beta versions  of our products and services, which are further refined before the release of  the final version. Because these products and services are still in a test  phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts  to do so. As such, we welcome User feedback on any privacy concerns you may  have. In light of the above and because of the complex and constantly changing  nature of our technology and business, and the security risks associated with  using the Internet, KaraokePlay does not guarantee error-free performance under  this Privacy Policy. To the extent permissible under law, KaraokePlay shall not be  liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this  Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p><strong>11.&nbsp; Modifications of the Privacy Policy</strong></p>
      <p>KaraokePlay reserves the rights to modify its Privacy  Policy at any time and will notify you by posting an amendment to the Privacy  Policy on the Service. Such modifications will become effective on the day they  are posted. KaraokePlay encourages you to frequently review the Privacy Policy for  any modifications.</p>
