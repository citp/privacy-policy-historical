You may ask your personal information to be deleted completely, if no enquiry from you is in progress. You also have the right to complain when your personal data protection rights have been violated. For your convenience we have provided a full list of our rights in the last Section GDPR Subject Rights. 

We will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with reasonable access to any of your personal information we maintain or correct it within 30 days as of receipt of your access request. 

Please, note that after deleting your information, you shall not be able to use adequately the BMAP Services. Users have the right to delete Client Data during the above term in a manner consistent with the functionality of the Services, if such deletion is in accordance with the GDPR (please, see Section GDPR Subject Rights). BMAP will comply with this instruction as soon as reasonably practicable and within a maximum period of 30 days, unless EU or Bulgarian law requires storage. Please, note that BMAP may keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes or be required (including by contract or GDPR) to keep certain of information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case BMAP will comply with the deletion request only after BMAP has fulfilled such requirements). 

If you wish to access, delete (when applicable) or correct your personal information please contact: dpo (@) kanbanize.com. Please state clear in the subject that your request concerns a privacy matter, and more specific whether it is a request to access, correction or deletion. Bear in mind that we may ask for additional information to determine your identity.

We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems). Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. 

If an End User interacts with one of our Clients and the End User seeks to access, or correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, especially when regarding data, entered or uploaded by Clients and End Users, the End User should address its inquiry directly to the Client because the Client is the data controller and we are only data processors.
