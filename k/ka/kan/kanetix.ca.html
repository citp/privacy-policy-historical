<b>Security</b>
<br>
Entering personal data on <i>Kanetix</i> is not only easy but also safe.  <i>Kanetix</i> uses an Apache server with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol, among the best Internet security software in the world, and Entrust.net certificates for securing the exchange of confidential data. This security technology encrypts the personal information that you send us (including things like names, addresses, emails and telephone numbers), so it cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet. We will evaluate and adopt new security technology as it becomes available.
<br><br>
You can find out when the secure SSL connection is activated by looking for the key or padlock icon in the lower corner of your browser window. If the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, this indicates that the browser is now in "secure" mode.
<br><br>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about security on our website, you can <a href="http://www.kanetix.ca/about_generic_about_us" onclick="javascript:email_us();return false;">send us an email through our online form</a>.
<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b>
<br>
Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive.  The only personal information that a cookie can contain is information supplied by the visitor and the cookies we use cannot read data off of our visitor's hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.
<br><br>
Cookie technology can save you time by eliminating the need to re-enter frequently requested information. Cookies also give us capability to understand how visitors use our site. We use this information to optimize our website and improve the visitor experience.
<br><br>
We use both session ID and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you choose to tick the box indicating you would like to be remembered, a persistent cookie is set so you don't have to reenter your login information more than once. If you later decide that you would no longer like to be 'remembered', the cookie will be removed when you log off. You can also remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.
<ul>
<b><i>Advertising</i></b> We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out of being served targeted ads by <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="new" rel="nofollow">clicking here</a>.  Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.
</ul>

<br><br>
<b>Collecting information</b>
<br>
We gather and store data about online usage on a collective rather than individual basis.  For example, like most websites, we gather aggregate information about the number of visitors that visit our website and the pages that they view, NOT what pages were viewed by each individual.  We use this information to anticipate bottlenecks, to gauge the capacity of our servers, and to improve the overall management of our website.
<br><br>
We also use Commission Junction to track visitors coming from our affiliate sites. This pixel tracking information helps determine the payments we are obliged to make to our affiliates for the traffic they send to us. 
<br><br>
Please note that our online usage and affiliate tracking systems do not gather or store personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
<b>Collecting personal identifiable information</b>
<br>
In some provinces, <i>Kanetix</i> offers visitors the option of personalized quotes and gathers personal information as part of this process.  Depending on the province, this may include obtaining your credit score from a credit reporting agency, or require you to provide details regarding your credit history. This information, along with the other details you enter will be used to provide you with a personalized offer and to determine the payment options that will be available to you.
<br><br>
Also, from time to time, <i>Kanetix</i> requests and collects personal information from visitors via surveys, contests, "Tell-a-friend" and Renewal Reminder services.  Participation is completely voluntary (opt-in).  Information requested has included your email address and that of the friend you are referring, name, demographic and insurance-related information.
<br><br>
Finally, you can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.  Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.
<br><br>
<b>Communication of personal identifiable information</b>
<br>
At various points on the <i>Kanetix</i> website and when visitors contact <i>Kanetix</i>, visitors may be asked if they consent to sharing their personal information with 3rd parties.  If they agree, <i>Kanetix</i>, provides one or more insurance suppliers with their personal information for the purposes of either preparing or validating an insurance quote.
<br><br>
<b>Email</b>
<br>
