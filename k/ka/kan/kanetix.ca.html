<p>Effective on August 09, 2006</p>
<h4><i>kanetix</i> believes in protecting the personal information that you provide us.  We have made safe computing and the protection of your privacy an important priority.  <i>kanetix</i> provides insurance quotes/estimates with minimal personal information. With the exception of our insurance suppliers and where mandated by the government, the personal information that you share with us will not be shared with third parties without your prior consent.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><i>kanetix</i> is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.

By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, we have agreed to notify you of:
<p></p>

<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Security</span><br>
 Entering personal data on <i>kanetix</i> is not only easy but also safe.  <i>kanetix</i> uses an Apache server with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol, among the best Internet security software in the world, and Entrust.net certificates for securing the exchange of confidential data. This security technology encrypts the personal information that you send us (including things like names, addresses, emails and telephone numbers), so it cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet. We will evaluate and adopt new security technology as it becomes available.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>You can find out when the secure SSL connection is activated by looking for the key or padlock icon in the lower corner of your browser window. If the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, this indicates that the browser is now in "secure" mode.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>If you have any questions about security on our website, you can <a href="http://www.kanetix.ca/about_generic_about_us" onclick="javascript:email_us('generic', '164576216');return false;">send us an email through our online form</a>.</h4> 
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Cookie Tracking Method</span><br>
Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive.  The only personal information that a cookie can contain is information supplied by the visitor and the cookies we use cannot read data off of our visitor's hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>Cookie technology can save you time by eliminating the need to re-enter frequently requested information such as your personal identification. Cookies also give us capability to understand how visitors use our site. We use this information to optimize our website and improve the visitor experience. </h4>
<p></p>
<h4>Please note that you have the option to set your browser to decline our cookies. If you choose not to receive cookies from <i>kanetix</i>, you may not be able to use all the services available on the site. These cookies are not tied to your personally identifiable information.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Collecting Information</span><br>
We gather and store data about online usage on a collective rather than individual basis.  For example, like most websites, we gather aggregate information about the number of visitors that visit our website and the pages that they view, NOT what pages were viewed by each individual.  We use this information to anticipate bottlenecks, to gauge the capacity of our servers, and to improve the overall management of our website.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4> We also use <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cj.com" target="new">Commission Junction</a> to track visitors coming from our affiliate sites. This pixel tracking information helps determine the payments we are obliged to make to our affiliates for the traffic they send to us. </h4> 
<p></p>
<h4>Please note that our online usage and affiliate tracking systems do not gather or store personally identifiable information.</h4>
<p></p>          
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Collecting personal identifiable information</span>
<br>
From time to time, <i>kanetix</i> requests and collects personal information from visitors via surveys, contests, "Tell-a-friend" and Renewal Reminder services.  Participation is completely voluntary (opt-in).  Information requested has included your email address and that of the friend you are referring, name, demographic and insurance-related information.</h4>
 <p></p>
<h4><b>Tell-a-friend</b><br>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  Kanetix Ltd. does not store this information.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">What is this personally identifiable information used for?</span>
          <br>
Our surveys are used to identify consumer or improve visitor satisfaction with our site.  The 'Tell-a-friend' service sends an email to a friend informing him/her about our site.  With our Renewal Reminder service, visitors can elect to have an email reminder sent to them a month before their insurance policy expires.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Policy Holder Information</span>
          <br>
If you purchase a policy online through <i>kanetix</i>, additional information is needed to process your request. This information may include your first and last name, email address, and dwelling address; your telephone number, driver's license number, vehicle identification number (if purchasing auto insurance), your current insurance company, employer name and credit card number or bank account information.  We forward this information to the insurance company to underwrite your policy. If you agree to purchase a policy from the insurance company, it may use your personal information for the purpose of fulfilling the requested insurance transaction and for future contact in accordance with the terms and conditions of its own privacy policy.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Service providers</span><br>
In some cases, we use third parties to provide the online quotes you receive on our site. The only information shared with the third party is the information required to provide you with an accurate quote. Depending on the type of quote you are seeking, this information may be comprised of one or more of the following: your age, gender, marital status, smoking status, driving, and insurance history. This information is only shared as necessary for the third party to provide you with an accurate quote.<p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p></h4>
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Testimonials</span>
          <br>
If you submit a testimonial to be posted on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</h4> 
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">How can you change your personal information?</span><br>
You can change your username (email address) and password online in the 'My kanetix' section of the site or you can update your personal information by calling us at 1 888 854 2503 or writing to us at 129 Spadina Ave., Suite 400, Toronto, Ontario, M5V 2L3.</h4> 
 <p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">For Your Protection</span>
          <br>
Your password is your private, secret entry code to your account information at <i>kanetix</i>.  It is required when you first log in to view or to modify your saved information.  Your password keeps your account information private and secure and you can change it as many times as you like.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4><i>kanetix</i> contains links to other websites. For example, you may find links to the suppliers featured in our Quotemaker or links to our affiliated brokerages. We do not exchange any information with these third-party sites if you click on them. If you do decide to click on one of these links, we encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their policies may differ from ours.</h4>
 <p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Opting out</span><br>
We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes. For example, when you sign up to our newsletter or renewal reminder service we automatically send you a confirmation email specifying the services you requested. From these confirmation emails, you can opt-out of both of these services at any time by replying and indicating your preference to be removed from our lists. You can also opt-out by emailing us at unsubscribe@kanetix.ca, calling us at 1 888 854 2503 or by writing to us at 129 Spadina Ave., Suite 400, Toronto, Ontario, M5V 2L3.<p>You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our one of our service providers, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.</p></h4>  
<p></p>
<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Notification of changes</span><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email or by means of a notice on our homepage.</h4>

<h4><span class="page_sub_header">Legal disclaimer</span>
          <br>
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</h4>
