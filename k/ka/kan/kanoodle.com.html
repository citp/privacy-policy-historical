						<b class="headline">Kanoodle Privacy Policy</b><br><br>
                        
							At Kanoodle, we take your privacy seriously and do all we can to protect your privacy while using our site and other
							services available through our site. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information about you as you
							utilize any Kanoodle services, including the adverting services we provide to businesses that have their own web sites
							(our "Advertising Network").  Our Privacy Policy is subject to change, so we encourage you to visit this page frequently
							to review our practices.  By using services provided by Kanoodle, you indicate that you agree to the collection and
							use of your information by Kanoodle as outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

							<b class="subhead">Why We Collect Information.</b><br>
							First and foremost, Kanoodle collects information to improve the services we provide and to present you with information
							and features that will interest you.  We also use your information to measure our success and performance. For example,
							aggregate information gives us an idea of the number of visitors we attract and how they navigate our site.<br><br>  
							
							<b class="subhead">Personal Information We Collect</b><br>
							Any personal information that is collected by us is provided by you strictly on a voluntary basis.  We may receive personal
							information from you in a number of ways, depending on the Kanoodle service you are using and your choices while using
							our services.  Depending upon the nature of the service being provided, we may ask you for, and you may choose to send to
							us, your name, e-mail address, physical address or other personal information necessary to complete a transaction or
							provide services to you.  For example, if you choose to run an advertising program through Kanoodle, we will need to
							collect certain personal information about you in connection with administering the program; however, we do not collect
							any personal information from site users in connection with our activities on sites in our Advertising Network. 
							Wherever we ask you for personal information, we try to include a link to this Privacy Policy for your review.<br><br>  

							<b class="subhead">Use of Personal Information</b><br>
							As noted above, unless you voluntarily provide personal information for a specific purpose, we do not collect personal
							information from you.  Moreover, we will never combine any personal information about a user of our site with any aggregate
							information we collect about that user, whether collected on our site or our Advertising Network.  If you choose to provide
							personal information, we use your personal information to provide you with particular services that you request.  For instance,
							we may use your personal information to contact you about advertising services that you have requested and to provide you with
							data about your advertising campaign.  We may also share your personal information with business partners who provide services
							you have requested. In these cases, we will provide only the information that is needed to perform the service . If you do not
							want Kanoodle to share your information in this way, you can simply choose not to sign up for the service in question. 
							By providing your email address to Kanoodle, you expressly consent to receive emails from us.<br><br>
							 
							Kanoodle does not sell, trade or rent personal information to other companies.  However, we will transfer personal
							information in connection with a sale or merger of Kanoodle or the division responsible for the services provided to you. 
							We may also share your personal information with our technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who
							make our site available, enhance its functionality or provide associated services and/or who deal with you in processing your
							orders and/or delivering content, samples, products, services and gifts and prizes.  These third parties are not allowed to
							use personal information except for the purposes of providing the applicable services.  In addition, we may provide information
							to law enforcement authorities or pursuant to a court order.  Our site and services are maintained in the United States of
							America.  By using the site and/or services, you authorize the export of personal information to the USA and its storage and
							use as specified in this policy.<br><br>
							
							<b class="subhead">Aggregate Information We Collect and Use</b><br>
							In addition to personal information, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such as site pages viewed,
							browser type, computer information, cookies, clickstream data and other information.  This aggregate information is analyzed
							and combined with similar aggregate information of other users and may be collected both on our site and on other sites in our
							Advertising Network.  Such aggregate information is anonymous and does not identify any individual user.  We may share aggregate
							information with our business partners and other third parties.<br><br>
							
							"Cookies" are small data files that are sent to your browser and are stored on your hard drive, keeping track of your general
							activity on a site. When you make subsequent visits to our site or another site on our Advertising Network, your cookie gives
							us a summary of your preferences and past experiences on the site. This allows us to tailor Kanoodle services to your needs. 
							Your cookie may be altered at different times throughout your visits to a site, and it is updated frequently as you use various
							Kanoodle features and services. Every time you use Kanoodle services, our server may deliver certain customized information to

							We may use third party advertising technology providers to serve advertisements and provide other services on this site and in
							connection with our Advertising Network.  These services may include the use of web beacons, web bugs, action tags and third party
							cookies which read our cookies, or visa-versa, and combine or supplement anonymous information.  If you want to prevent a
							third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading cookies on your computer, currently you may either visit each third party
							advertising network's web site individually and opt out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out of all network advertising
							cookies.  <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">Click here</a> for the NAI gateway opt-out site. This site will also
							allow you to review the third-party advertising companies' privacy policies.<br><br>
							
							"Clickstream data" is a trail of electronic information that is left at each web site you visit. This information can be collected
							and stored by a site's server.  We may, for example, use clickstream data to tell us the type of computer and browsing software
							you use, the address of the site from which you linked to our site, how much time you spend on each page of our site, how you
							navigate throughout the site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of our users.<br><br> 

							<b class="subhead">Supplementation of Information</b><br>
							In order for our site to perform properly and as necessary to enhance our services, we may supplement the information we receive
							on this site with information from third party sources.  [For example, to determine if our customers qualify for credit, we may
							use their personal information to request a credit report.  As another example, we may combine cookie data gathered on this site
							or on other sites in our Advertising Network with cookie data from a third party in order to improve our services.<br><br>

							<b class="subhead">Other Web Sites</b><br>
							Our site may link to advertisers and other sites that collect personal information about you when you leave Kanoodle and that
							may have privacy policies and practices that are different from ours. This type of collection or use of information is beyond
							Kanoodle's control and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every site you
							visit before providing any information.<br><br>

							<b class="subhead">Security</b><br>
							Kanoodle stores all data using industry standard security devices, such as firewalls and encryption protocols, to prevent
							against unauthorized access to our data. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to
							safeguard the information we collect. We have put in place policies to restrict access to your information by our employees.<br><br>
