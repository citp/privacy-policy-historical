</font> </b></font> <font size="2" face="Verdana">Kangun.com allows other 
companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements 
within the Kangun.com. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use 
technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that 
appear on the Kangun.com. They automatically receive your IP address when this 
happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or 
Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to 
personalize the advertising content you see.<br>
<br>
Kangun.com does not provide any personally identifiable information to these 
third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of 
a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or 
opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Kangun.com to show an 
advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience 
segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of 
content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may 
conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. 
The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Kangun.com, 
such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally 
identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.<br>

practices. Kangun.com's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control
