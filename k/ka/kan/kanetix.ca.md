Our Privacy Pledge  
Effective on July 25, 2005

_kanetix_ believes in protecting the personal information that you provide us. We have made safe computing and the protection of your privacy an important priority. _kanetix_ provides insurance quotes/estimates with minimal personal information. With the exception of our insurance suppliers and where mandated by the government, the personal information that you share with us will not be shared with third parties without your prior consent. 

_kanetix_ is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site kanetix.ca. Because the _kanetix_ website wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, _kanetix_ has agreed to disclose its information practices to TRUSTe and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance to TRUSTe privacy standards. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, we have agreed to notify you of: 

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website 
  2. Who is collecting the information 
  3. How the information is used 
  4. With whom the information may be shared 
  5. What choices are available to you regarding the collection, use and distribution of the information 
  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the control of _kanetix_
  7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information 



If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact kanetix. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or you do not feel your inquiry has been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php) at www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with _kanetix_ to resolve your concerns.

Secure Data Transfer   
Entering personal data on _kanetix_ is not only easy but also safe. _kanetix_ uses an Apache server with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol, among the best Internet security software in the world, and Entrust.net certificates for securing the exchange of confidential data. This security technology encrypts the personal information that you send us (including credit card numbers, banking information, names, addresses, and telephone numbers), so it cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet. We will evaluate and adopt new security technology as it becomes available. 

You can find out when the secure SSL connection is activated by looking for the key or padlock icon in the lower corner of your browser window. If the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, this indicates that the browser is now in "secure" mode. 

  
Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive. The only personal information that a cookie can contain is information supplied by the visitor and the cookies we use cannot read data off of our visitor's hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites. 

Cookie technology can save you time by eliminating the need to re-enter frequently requested information such as your personal identification. Cookies also give us capability to understand how visitors use our site. We use this information to optimize our website and improve the visitor experience. 

Please note that you have the option to set your browser to decline our cookies. If you choose not to receive cookies from _kanetix_ , you may not be able to use all the services available on the site. These cookies are not tied to your personally identifiable information. 

  
We gather and store data about online usage on a collective rather than individual basis. For example, like most websites, we gather aggregate information about the number of visitors that visit our website and the pages that they view, NOT what pages were viewed by each individual. We use this information to anticipate bottlenecks, to gauge the capacity of our servers, and to improve the overall management of our website. 

We also use [Commission Junction](http://www.cj.com/) to track visitors coming from our affiliate sites. This pixel tracking information helps determine the payments we are obliged to make to our affiliates for the traffic they send to us. 

Please note that our online usage and affiliate tracking systems do not gather or store personally identifiable information. 

  
From time to time, _kanetix_ requests and collects personal information from visitors via surveys, contests, "Tell-a-friend" and Renewal Reminder services. Participation is completely voluntary (opt-in). Information requested has included your email address and that of the friend you are referring, name, demographic and insurance-related information. 

  
Our surveys are used to monitor or improve visitor satisfaction with our site. The 'Tell-a-friend' service sends an email to a friend informing him/her about our site. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will auotmatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Kanetix Ltd. does not store your friend's information for any purpose. With our Renewal Reminder service, visitors can elect to have an email reminder sent to them a month before their insurance policy expires. 

  
If you purchase a policy online through _kanetix_ , additional information is needed to process your request. This information includes your first and last name, email address, and dwelling address; your telephone number, driver's license number, vehicle identification number (if purchasing auto insurance) and provincial health card number (if purchasing travel insurance); your current insurance company, employer name and credit card number or bank account information. We forward this information to the insurance company to underwrite your policy. If you agree to purchase a policy from the insurance company, it may use your personal information for the purpose of fulfilling the requested insurance transaction and for future contact in accordance with the terms and conditions of its own privacy policy. 

  
In some cases, we use third parties to provide the online quotes you receive on our site. The only information shared with the third party is the information required to provide you with an accurate quote. Depending on the type of quote you are seeking, this information may be comprised of one or more of the following: your age, gender, marital status, smoking status, driving, and insurance history. This information is only shared as necessary for the third party to provide you with an accurate quote.

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. 

  
If you submit a testimonial to be posted on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. 

  
You can change your username (email address) and password online in the 'My kanetix' section of the site or you can update your personal information by calling us at 1 888 854 2503 or writing to us at 129 Spadina Ave., Suite 400, Toronto, Ontario, M5V 2L3. 

  
Your password is your private, secret entry code to your account information at _kanetix_. It is required when you first log in to view or to modify your saved information. Your password keeps your account information private and secure and you can change it as many times as you like. 

_kanetix_ contains links to other websites. For example, you may find links to the suppliers featured in our Quotemaker or links to our affiliated brokerages. We do not exchange any information with these third-party sites if you click on them. If you do decide to click on one of these links, we encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their policies may differ from ours. 

  
We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes. For example, when you sign up to our newsletter or renewal reminder service we automatically send you a confirmation email specifying the services you requested. From these confirmation emails, you can opt-out of both of these services at any time by replying and indicating your preference to be removed from our lists. You can also opt-out by emailing us at unsubscribe@kanetix.ca, calling us at 1 888 854 2503 or by writing to us at 129 Spadina Ave., Suite 400, Toronto, Ontario, M5V 2L3.

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our one of our service providers, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party. 

  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email or by means of a notice on our homepage. 

  
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website. 

  
We are committed to providing excellent service to you. However, if you have a concern or complaint, please contact us, because we are also committed to working with you to achieve a resolution and following through to a successful conclusion as quickly as possible. In most cases, complaints are resolved simply by discussing it with us. You should be able to get swift results by:
