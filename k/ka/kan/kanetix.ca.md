Our Privacy Pledge  
_kanetix_ believes in protecting the personal information that you provide us. We have made safe computing and the protection of your privacy an important priority. _kanetix_ provides insurance quotes/estimates with minimal personal information. With the exception of our insurance suppliers and where mandated by the government, the personal information that you share with us will not be shared with third parties without your prior consent. 

To demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, _kanetix_ has agreed to disclose its information practices to TRUSTe and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance to TRUSTe privacy standards. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users’ trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, we have agreed to notify you of: 

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identifiable information is collected from you through the Web site 
  2. Who is collecting the information 
  3. How the information is used 
  4. With whom the information may be shared 
  5. What choices are available to you regarding the collection, use and distribution of the information 
  6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the control of _kanetix_
  7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information 



If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact _kanetix_ by [email](mailto:questions@kanetix.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or you do not feel your inquiry has been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact [TRUSTe.](http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html) TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with _kanetix_ to resolve your concerns. 

|  Secure Data Transfer   
Entering personal data on _kanetix_ is not only easy but also safe. _kanetix_ uses an Apache server with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol, among the best Internet security software in the world, and Entrust.net certificates for securing the exchange of confidential data. This security technology encrypts the personal information that you send us (including credit card numbers, banking information, names, addresses, and telephone numbers), so it cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet. We will evaluate and adopt new security technology as it becomes available. 

You can find out when the secure SSL connection is activated by looking for the key or padlock icon in the lower corner of your browser window. If the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, this indicates that the browser is now in "secure" mode. 

Cookie Tracking Method   
Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive. The only personal information that a cookie can contain is information supplied by the visitor and the cookies we use cannot read data off of our visitor's hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. 

Cookie technology can save you time by eliminating the need to re-enter frequently requested information such as your personal identification. Cookies also give us capability to understand how visitors use our site. We use this information to optimize our Web site and improve the visitor experience. 

Please note that you have the option to set your browser to decline our cookies. If you choose not to receive cookies from kanetix, you may not be able to use all the services available on the site. 

Collecting Information   
We gather and store data about online usage on a collective rather than individual basis. For example, like most Web sites, we gather aggregate information about the number of visitors that visit our Web site and the pages that they view, NOT what pages were viewed by each individual. We use this information to anticipate bottlenecks, to gauge the capacity of our servers, and to improve the overall management of our Web site. 

We also use [Commission Junction](http://www.cj.com/) to track visitors coming from our affiliate sites. This tracking information helps determine the payments we are obliged to make to our affiliates for the traffic they send to us. In addition, we gather statistics related to our online chat sessions with visitors. We use the information to understand the effectiveness of this technology on our Web site. 

Please note that our online usage, affiliate, and chat management tracking systems do not gather or store personally identifiable information. 

Collecting personal identifiable information   
From time to time, _kanetix_ requests and collects personal information from visitors via surveys, contests, "Tell-a-friend" and Renewal Reminder services. Participation is completely voluntary (opt-in). Information requested has included email address, name, demographic and insurance-related information. 

What is this information used for?   
Our surveys are used to monitor or improve visitor satisfaction with our site. The 'Tell-a-friend' service sends an email to a friend informing him/her about our site. This information is stored for the sole purpose of sending this single email. With our Renewal Reminder service, visitors can elect to have an email reminder sent to them a month before their insurance policy expires. 

Policy Holder Information   
If you purchase a policy online through _kanetix_ , additional information is needed to process your request. This information includes your first and last name, email address, and dwelling address; your telephone number, driver's license number, vehicle identification number (if purchasing auto insurance) and provincial health card number (if purchasing travel insurance); your current insurance company, employer name and credit card number or bank account information. We forward this information to the insurance company to underwrite your policy. If you agree to purchase a policy from the insurance company, it may use your personal information for the purpose of fulfilling the requested insurance transaction and for future contact in accordance with the terms and conditions of its own privacy policy. 

How can you change your personal information?  
You can change your username (email address) and password online in the 'My kanetix' section of the site or you can update your personal information by calling us at 1 888 854 2503 or writing to us at 77 Peter St, Suite 200, Toronto, Ontario, M5V 2G4.
