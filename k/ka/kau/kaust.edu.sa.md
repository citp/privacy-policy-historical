This Privacy Policy applies to personally identifiable information KAUST collects through the KAUST website (the "Website") and does not apply to information KAUST collects in any other manner. Your use of the Website is subject to this Privacy Policy and KAUST’s [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20101230152542id_/http%3A//www.kaust.edu.sa/footer/termsofuse.html). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how KAUST treats information collected through the Website.

This information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. 

In order to maintain your information in an efficient manner, KAUST retains the information it gathers about you to make your repeat visits to the Website more efficient, practical, and relevant.

These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions. 
  * KAUST may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if it believes in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of KAUST; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.
