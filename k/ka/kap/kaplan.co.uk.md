## Privacy and cookies

### What is a cookie?

A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website's server. Only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each cookie is unique to your web browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier as well as the site name. Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting ("first party cookies") or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing ("third party cookies").

### How are cookies used?

Cookies do lots of different jobs, including letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. Most websites you visit will use cookies to improve your user experience by enabling that website to "remember" you, either for the duration of your visit (using a "session cookie") or for repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie").

If a website doesn't use cookies, it will think you are a visiting the website for the first time every time you move to a new page on the site - for example, when you enter your login details and move to another page the website won't recognise you and it won't be able to keep you logged in.

Some websites will also use cookies to enable them to target their advertising or marketing messages based, for example, on your location and/or browsing habits.
