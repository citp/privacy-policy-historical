We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on our Site. All data exchanged between the Site and its Users happens over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures. While there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet, we will take all appropriate steps to insure the safety of your personal information.

### Third Party Websites

Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors, and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies.

### Registered Users

Registration is not mandatory to access the public areas of the Site. Registration is, however, required for access to certain areas of the Site and the products and services provided through those areas of the Site. The areas of the Site requiring registration are noted on the Site.

Users registering to receive an account on the Site will choose a username and password for purposes of accessing their account and the portions of the Site available to account holders. When accessing the portions of the Site available to account holders, Users may be required to provide their username and password.

Kapost is not responsible for any loss or misuse of your username and password. ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY YOU SHOULD NOT SHARE YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD WITH OTHERS.

We provide you the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personal information used for certain purposes. If you are a User of the Site and you no longer wish to receive email or mail from us, you may opt-out of receiving email or mail from us.

All opt-out requests can be made by accessing your account through the Site or emailing us at: [privacy@kapost.com](mailto:privacy@kapost.com).

### Access to Your Personal Information

If required by law, upon request, we will facilitate reasonable access to a User’s personal information. We rely the User to update and correct their personal information. All requests must be directed to [privacy@kapost.com](mailto:privacy@kapost.com). We may require the User to authenticate your identity before honoring requests. We may retain information if required to do so by applicable laws.

### Sharing Your Personal Information

We may share your personal information with our corporate affiliates (e.g., parent company, subsidiaries, or other companies under common control).

We may ask if you would like us to share your personal information with other unaffiliated third parties who are not described elsewhere in this policy, and we may do so with your consent.

We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and Users with our business partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.

Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information of certain Users of the Site when we have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce the Terms of Use for the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or protect Kapost’s rights under applicable law, including, without limitation, Kapost’s intellectual property rights. In this situation, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this disclosure to all affected Users to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.

If Kapost elects, in its reasonable discretion, to transfer ownership or control of the Site to a third party, whether or not in the context of an acquisition of Kapost or a merger of Kapost with a third party, you consent to the transfer of your personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information by Kapost to that third party, provided that all use of your information by that third party remains subject to the terms of this Policy.

We may share your personal information with service providers. Among other things, service providers may help us to administer our website, conduct surveys, mail communications, provide technical support, and/or other legitimate purposes as provided by applicable laws. These service providers may collect store and otherwise process information on our behalf.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

Kapost has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the effective date at the top of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this privacy policy periodically and become aware of modifications.
