								<font size="4"></font><p>Kagi is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to improve our ability to serve your needs. This privacy policy applies only to Kagi and not product suppliers outside of Kagi who are associated with the purchase transaction. Please read on for more details.<br>
<br>
What information does Kagi collect and how is it used?<br>
<br>
Kagi collects and stores customer information only when you purchase from us. We store the information you personally provide. If you do not provide it we cannot store it. Our order forms are customized by each product supplier and their forms can ask for information other than name, postal address and email. Except for credit card details, whatever information you supply on the order forms is passed through to the product supplier who requested the information.<br>
When you place an order we may also collect information on how you communicated with us. We do this primarily so that we have alternate ways of communicating with you should the information you provided be inadequate. Information on how you communicated with us can include: your Internet address, the language you selected for viewing the order form, your browser type, the currency in which you viewed the prices, whether you used a secure or insecure web page, the return email address shown in your email messages, the return address on envelopes, the fax number on faxes, the phone number from which you are calling and any other information that might help us to contact you that might be included with your payment.<br>
<br>
Except for credit card details, all the information we collect from you is forwarded to the appropriate product supplier so that you can receive your product, support for it, and any additional information that might be related to your purchase.<br>
<br>
<br>
Will Kagi disclose information it collects to those not involved with the purchase transaction?<br>
<br>
Since our beginnings in 1994 Kagi has never sold, rented or traded personal information to others not associated with a purchase transaction, however we reserve the right to do so. If Kagi does decide to do this we will email you and give you 30 days to inform us if you wish for your information to remain private. At this time we do not contemplate doing this and thus we have no system for you to tell us to never release your information.<br>
There can be people outside of Kagi who are associated with the purchase transaction. They can fulfil a variety of tasks such as technical support, product shipping, etc. We have no direct control over their use of the information we relay to them to complete the purchase transaction and can make no assurances as to their use of your personal information. We do stop doing business with those who are associated with the purchase transaction if they abuse the information we relay to them.<br>
<br>
Kagi does aggregate statistics about the data we collect and share it with others in order to improve our service. This aggregated data will not include information that identifies you personally.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kagi privacy policy changes<br>
<br>
Any changes to the Kagi privacy policy will be posted here. This policy is dated 24 August 1999.</p><font size="2"><a href="/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ViewFAQs.woa/wa/specificFAQ?FAQ=nameOnCCBill">Previous</a> | <a href="/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ViewFAQs.woa/wa/specificFAQ?FAQ=SecurityIdVisaMC">Next</a> | <a href="/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ViewFAQs.woa/wa/feedbackForm?FAQQuestion=Privacy&amp;FAQHTMLName=privacy">FAQ Feedback</a><br></font><font size="2">This FAQ: http://faq.kagi.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ViewFAQs.woa/wa/specificFAQ?FAQ=privacy</font>
