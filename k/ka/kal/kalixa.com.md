# Kalixa Privacy Policy

### Introduction

Kalixa is brought to you by Kalixa Pay Ltd (Kalixa Pay), who is committed to protecting your privacy. All data is collected, transferred, processed and maintained in accordance with the principles contained within the Data Protection Act 1998 of the United Kingdom and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. We recognise our responsibility to keep your information confidential and secure. Any personal information about you which we obtain in connection with your Kalixa Card registration and eAccount operation, we undertake to keep safe. We will not share this information with other people or businesses, other than stated in this policy, without your prior consent.

**The following statement explains our policy regarding the personal information we collect about you.**

### How we collect and use information

To enable us to issue your Kalixa Card and set up your eAccount, we need to obtain information at registration which includes your name, your e-mail and home addresses, and other relevant personal details.

As a registered user, you have the option to change or revise your personal data (with the exception of your user name, first name, last name, date of birth and country) at any time. After logging in to the Website, you may change your information in the Personal Details area of My Profile.

The information that you provide will only be used for the purposes described at the time of your registration and where applicable in the Terms and Conditions that apply to the relevant product or service. We will also collect, store and process your personal information on our computers to develop and improve our overall service to you, communicate with you and to manage your eAccount.

We give access to your personal information only to those employees who require it to provide our services.

If you do not want to receive marketing communication , please log in to your account and manage your settings for communications.

We will not disclose any such information outside of Kalixa Pay except in the limited circumstances described below, as permitted by applicable law, or with your express permission:

• To fraud prevention agencies and other organisations who may use the information to prevent fraud and money laundering, or in order to assist us in investigating suspected violations of our Terms and Condition

• To persons acting as our agents under a strict code of confidentiality

• To anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer our rights and duties under our Terms and Conditions with you

• As required by law or regulation

To fulfil some of the above processes we may have to pass your information to other parts of our group of companies, which may be in other countries. We will make sure that they agree to apply the same levels of protection as we are required to apply to information held in the UK and to use your information only for the purpose of providing the service to us.

As with any other business, it is possible that Kalixa Pay in the future could amalgamate or merge with or be acquired by another company. If such acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the personal information maintained by Kalixa Pay, including customer eAccount information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described above.

### How we apply our policy

In order to put our policy into practice, we use our best endeavours to follow these guidelines:

  * We will ensure our systems are secure to protect your personal information from misuse 
  * We will not hold your personal information for longer than is necessary 
  * We will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to other people or businesses unless we have your consent; with your consent, we will only share your information with carefully chosen, reputable and trustworthy third parties 
  * We will comply promptly with any instructions from you to update your information or requests from you to see the information that we hold on you 
  * We will comply with lawful requests to disclose personal information to certain authorities (e.g. the police) 
  * We may monitor and record any telephone calls to ensure we follow your instructions correctly and to improve our service 



If you would like a copy of the information we hold about you, please write to: Kalixa Pay Ltd., PO Box 72074, London EC4P 4GB, United Kingdom. There will be an administration charge of £12 for this service.

### Data encryption and Technical Security Measures

To protect your personal data during communication with your web browser, Kalixa Pay’s payment provider, CQR Payment Solutions GmbH, uses secure and tested encryption technology from VeriSign®. Online transactions are protected by the extremely reliable security system of a worldwide-accredited partner.

To prevent the illegal manipulation through a third person, the IP address of the logged-on computer will be requested and saved. In addition, all your data is protected from unauthorised access by a firewall – a computer that is fitted with complex security technology specifically designed to shield the company’s network from the Internet. Additionally, the company uses reliable internal data protection mechanisms combined with a restrictive security system.
