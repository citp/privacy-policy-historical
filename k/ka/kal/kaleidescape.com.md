## Kaleidescape Privacy Policy

Kaleidescape, Inc. and its affiliates, including Kaleidescape Canada, Inc. and Kaleidescape Europe Ltd., (collectively referred to as "Kaleidescape") take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information that we collect and receive about you and your use of your Kaleidescape System ("System"), the Kaleidescape Movie Guide and Music Guide Services, and our websites.

This Privacy Policy supplements and is incorporated into the Kaleidescape Service & License Agreement. This Privacy Policy constitutes the entire agreement between you and Kaleidescape concerning the subject matter herein, and your acceptance of the Kaleidescape Service & License Agreement will signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.

To provide you with a better, more satisfying experience, Kaleidescape collects and uses certain types of information, as described below. Kaleidescape does not intend to disclose to any third party, except as provided below, any personal information, including what CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs you - as an individual or household - have purchased, loaded into or viewed with your System.

### Types of Information Collected

  * Kaleidescape collects certain personal information when you activate your System, such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. Kaleidescape collects additional information from time to time, such as the serial numbers of the components of your System and the software versions and options used by them.
  * Kaleidescape automatically collects and maintains diagnostic and usage information from every System connected to the Internet for the purposes of quality control, technical troubleshooting, and the development of new features, products, and services. Diagnostic and usage information includes a detailed record of the operating history of your System, such as browser interface settings, CD, DVD, and Blu-ray Disc imports, user inputs and response times (including details about CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs played), disk errors or failures, disk space use, component temperatures, and information entered into the browser interface. Diagnostic and usage information also contains and is identified by the serial numbers of the components of your System and their IP addresses.
  * Kaleidescape automatically collects IP addresses and website usage information from you when you visit our website. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors use and navigate our website on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors to each Web page, and the length of their visits.
  * Kaleidescape does not alter its data collection based on the presence of a 'do not track' request configured in your browser; however, you may opt-out of data collection performed by Google Analytics. Kaleidescape collects data using Google Analytics for Display Advertisers, including Google Analytics for Demographics and Interest Reporting. The data collected may be used to perform techniques such as market segmentation, remarketing and A/B testing, in order to provide relevant products and services. You may opt-out from Google Analytics for Display Advertisers by following the instructions here: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>.

  


### How We Use Information Collected

We may use information in the following ways:

  * For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example, to provide a service that you desire, to troubleshoot your System, or to send emails that you have requested.
  * To send you email notifications about new or existing products and services, such as software upgrades. 
  * To enhance existing features, products and services, or to develop new features, products and services. 
  * To better understand our channel and market.
  * To provide third parties with aggregate information (that will not identify you or your household) about our user base and usage patterns, including movies played.

  * To fulfill any other reasonable business purpose that Kaleidescape deems to be desirable.



Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally-identifiable information outside of Kaleidescape.

We may disclose and use personally-identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce our Kaleidescape Service & License Agreement (for example, when necessary to protect our or a third-party's intellectual property or proprietary rights). We may also disclose personally-identifiable information when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf including, without limitation, packaging, mailing and delivering products and services, answering customer questions about products and services, processing registrations, analyzing our market, and designing future products. We will only provide those companies with the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any country in which Kaleidescape or its subsidiaries or agents maintain a presence; you consent to any such transfer of your personal information outside of your country.

Kaleidescape is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, your personal information will be stored on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through encryption.

  


### Policy Modifications

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically.
