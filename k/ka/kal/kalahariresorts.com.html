																	Privacy:</font>
																<br>
																Kalahari Development LLC and LMN Development LLC (collectively, "we", "us", 
																"our") are committed to safeguarding the privacy of every individual who visits 
																our Internet sites ("Websites"), specifically <a href="http://www.kalahariresorts.com/" class="RoomLinkWhite">
																	www.KalahariResorts.com</a>. The following Privacy Policy outlines the 
																information we will collect through the Websites and how that information will 
																be used. This Policy will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want 
																this information collected or further disseminated. Any changes to the Privacy 
																Policy will always be posted on the Websites.
																<br>
																<br>
																<font class="menuHeader">Information We Collect:</font> <b>
																	<br>
																	Personally identifiable information</b> -<br>
																The term 'personally identifiable information' refers to data you voluntarily 
																provide while using the Websites that identifies you and/or the company on 
																whose behalf you are accessing and using the Websites. Examples of personal 
																information may include data in connection with our services, such as your 
																name, e-mail address, phone number, company affiliation, physical address 
																and/or certain other personal information.
																<br>
																<br>
																Personally identifiable information is never collected through the Websites in 
																a non-obvious manner.
																<br>
																<br>
																<b>Non-personally identifiable information</b> -
																<br>
																The term 'non-personally identifiable information' refers to general 
																information collected through technology regarding Websites visitors and users 
																that relates specifically to the Websites. For instance, when visiting the 
																Websites, your IP address may be collected. An IP address is often associated 
																with the portal or service through which you enter the Internet. Standing 
																alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable.
																<br>
																<br>
																The Websites also use cookies. A cookie is a text file placed on your 
																computer’s hard drive that identifies your computer so the site can remember 
																information you have told us before or activities you have carried out on our 
																site. The cookies can only contain data you told us about yourself. They cannot 
																examine your computer or read data from it. Cookies cannot transmit a virus or 
																do damage to your system. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. 
																By clicking on the Help portion of your browser's menu bar, you can learn how 
																to reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or to indicate when a cookie is 
																being sent.
																<br>
																<br>
																Examples of non-personally identifiable information collected include traffic 
																patterns, number of visits to certain pages, visits from other Internet sites 
																or to third-party Internet sites linked to the Websites, use of particular 
																services and interest in services, information or features of the Websites or 
																other parties made available through or found at the Websites. &nbsp;
																<br>
																<br>
																<font class="menuHeader">How Information is Used:</font>
																<br>
																<b>Personally identifiable information</b> -<br>
																Personally identifiable information may be used to assist with marketing 
																programs designed to identify broad market groups for specific promotional 
																opportunities. By providing personally identifiable information for this 
																purpose you agree to be placed on marketing lists and may receive promotional 
																notices from us or our affiliates, from time to time.
																<br>
																<br>
																We may also use your personally identifiable information for operational uses. 
																Examples include using your information to complete transactions requested by 
																you (such as your purchase of a product or service, including room 
																reservations, through the Websites), to send you administrative communications 
																either about your account with us, or to share your personal information with 
																our telephone reservations center in order to allow our staff to respond more 
																promptly to your questions or requests when you call.
																<br>
																<br>
																Your personally identifiable information may be shared with reputable third 
																parties, but only for use in advertising campaign delivery or to provide more 
																relevant advertising. Your personally identifiable information may be combined 
																with additional information provided by you or augmented from other data 
																sources
																<br>
																<br>
																We will not sell or rent any personally identifiable information collected with 
																any party not affiliated with us without your express written consent, except 
																as provided below.
																<br>
																<br>
																<b>Non-personally identifiable information</b> -
																<br>
																Non-personally identifiable information is used to make the Websites more 
																helpful, interesting and useful to our visitors.
																<br>
																<br>
																Non-personally identifiable information may be used to provide anonymous 
																statistical analysis of visitor traffic patterns, administer the Websites and 
																servers, to allow for the auditing of our services by third parties and to 
																improve our services.
																<br>
																<br>
																<font class="menuHeader">Permission for Use: </font>
																<br>
																We may collect and use personally identifiable information that you submit at 
																the Websites in any manner consistent with uses in this Privacy Policy or 
																disclosed elsewhere on the Websites at the point you submit such personal 
																information.
																<br>
																<br>
																<font class="menuHeader">Privacy Statement Exceptions: </font>
																<br>
																<b>Special circumstances</b> -
																<br>
																We may monitor and, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required, 
																disclose personally identifiable information to protect the security, property, 
																assets and/or rights of Kalahari Development LLC and LMN Development LLC from 
																unauthorized use, or misuse, of the Websites or anything found at the Websites.<br>
																<br>
																We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information of the 
																users of the Websites for any law enforcement purpose at the request of any law 
																enforcement body or in response to subpoena or as otherwise required by court 
																or administrative agency.
																<br>
																<br>
																<b>Sale of assets</b> -
																<br>
																No part of this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of 
																Kalahari Development LLC and/or LMN Development LLC to transfer all or part of 
																its businesses or assets, including the Websites to an affiliate or independent 
																third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever. We 
																specifically reserve the right to transfer personally identifiable information 
																collected from the Websites to the buyer of that portion of our business 
																relating to that information. You may opt out of continued use of your 
																information by any buyer of the Websites.
																<br>
																<br>
																<font class="menuHeader">Links Provided to Other Internet Sites: </font>
																<br>
																The Internet sites owned and operated by Kalahari Development LLC and/or LMN 
																Development LLC may contain links to other Internet sites. These third party 
																Internet sites may not follow the same privacy practices of Kalahari 
																Development LLC and/or LMN Development LLC. Therefore, we are not responsible 
																for the privacy practices or the actions of third parties, including without 
																limitation, any Internet site owners whose Internet sites may be reached 
																through any Internet site owned or operated by Kalahari Development LLC and/or 
																LMN Development LLC. For this reason, we strongly encourage you to view the 
																privacy policies of these other sites prior to submitting any personally 
																identifiable information to them.
																<br>
																<br>
																<font class="menuHeader">User Consent to This Privacy Policy: </font>
																<br>
																Use of the Websites signifies your consent, as well as the consent of the 
																company for whom you use the Websites and whose information you submit (if 
																any), to this on-line Privacy Policy, including the collection and use of 
																information by Kalahari Development LLC and/or LMN Development LLC, as 
																described in this policy, and also signifies agreement to the Terms of Use for 
																the Websites. Continued access and use of the Websites without acceptance of 
																the terms of this Privacy Policy relieves us from responsibility to the user.
																<br>
																<br>
																<font class="menuHeader">Withdrawing Consent: </font>
																<br>
																If, after permitting use of your personally identifiable information, you later 
																decide that you no longer want us to include your information in our marketing 
																database or otherwise contact you or to use your information in the manner 
																disclosed in this Privacy Policy or at the Websites, simply tell us by 
																contacting us using the resources listed at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
