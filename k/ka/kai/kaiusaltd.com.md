# Privacy Policy | KAI USA ltd.

This Online Privacy Policy specifies the information Kai USA Ltd. (Kershaw Knives, Shun Cutlery, Zero Tolerance Knives, and Kai Housewares) collects and how we use that information. The amount and type of information that we receive depends on how you use the site.

This Policy applies to our online practices only. It was last updated on June 26, 2018. We reserve the right to change any part of the Kai USA Online Privacy Policy at any time. If you have questions or comments regarding this policy, please use the Contact Us form to get in touch with us.

##  ABOUT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT & HOW WE USE IT

###  WHEN YOU VISIT OUR WEBSITE

As a visitor to our website, you can always browse without providing personal information. The information does not personally identify you and cannot be linked back to you unless you decide at some point to identify yourself.

Website Analytics

We use Google Analytics to gather statistics and measure our website activity so that we can better understand our customer base. If you are browsing, we may collect the following information, which is not personally identifying information:

  * Browser type and operating system
  * Date and time you accessed our site
  * Number of times you accessed our site
  * Whether your computer is enabled for Javascript or cookies
  * Language preference from your browser
  * Applications and plug-ins
  * Pages you visit
  * If you came to our site from another website, the address of that site



We have also implemented IP Anonymization in Google Analytics to further protect your privacy. All IP addresses are “masked” as they are received by the Analytics Collection Network and before they are processed or stored. This prevents data from going to Google Analytics with an identifiable IP address and protects your privacy.

Use of Cookies

  * Cookies are pieces of information that are sent by our website and stored on your computer’s hard drive or temporarily in the computer’s memory.
  * We may use session cookies, which terminate when you close your browser, and/or persistent cookies, which remain on your computer until manually deleted.
  * Cookies can help you move faster through our site, remember your preferences, and help us estimate our audience and what web pages they visit.
  * The use of cookies, or similar technologies, is an industry standard and you will find them on most major websites.
  * For more information about cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org
  * See below for information on how to control cookie use.



Advertising

_Kai USA currently does not use:_

  * Remarketing with Google Analytics
  * Google Display Network Impression Reporting



_We do use:_

  * Google Analytics Demographics & Interest Reporting
  * Google Analytics tracking codes



Should this change in the future, we will update this Online Privacy Policy.

We do not/will not facilitate the merging of personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that are based on the DoubleClick cookie unless you have specifically opted-in to that merger. We will not attempt to disaggregate data that Google reports in aggregate.

####  How We Use this Information

Cookies and similar technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies on an individual as well as an aggregated basis. By showing how and when visitors use the site, cookies help Kai USA better determine which areas of our site are popular and which areas are not.

We use Google tracking codes for advertising campaign reporting when we place advertising on other websites or email lists. These reports are aggregate and non-personally identifiable. This reporting is shared internally with Kai USA and Kai Corp personnel only.
