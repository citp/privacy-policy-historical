We at Kaspersky Lab will solely use such data for the purpose of scanning and analyzing it for possible malware infection, but we cannot take responsibility regarding your right to share them with us in the first place.</p>

<li>your company's license to use Kaspersky Lab applications;</li>
<li>information you provided to Kaspersky Lab’s technical support. Please refer to section <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/support/rdp?cid=ca&amp;utm_source=companyaccount.kaspersky.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=company_account&amp;utm_content=en">Regulation on data provisioning</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Description of Service</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Account registration</em></strong>. To use CompanyAccount and access all of its features, you must create:</p>
<ul>
<li>personal account;</li>
<li>an account for your company, unless your coworkers have done this previously.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will require that you provide your corporate email address (which will be your username), password, first and last name, company name and country, and your company's license to use Kaspersky Lab applications. We will process and use this information solely for the purpose of providing you with CompanyAccount services and technical support, unless you explicitly choose to have it processed and used for other purposes. After registration your personal account will be linked to your company's account. If your company's account was previously created, then your registration information (first and last name and corporate email address) will be sent to the CompanyAccount Administrator from your company. The company employee who first registers the company and a personal account is typically designated as the Administrator.</p>
<p><strong><em>Account settings. </em></strong>You can at any time view, update, correct your account information and password, or delete your account on the "My account" tab. Your company's CompanyAccount Administrator will also be able to change your account settings and reset your password. If you are your company's CompanyAccount Administrator, then you have the ability to edit personal accounts for all of your colleagues and block the entire company's account (employees' personal accounts will remain in the system).</p>
<p><strong><em>Licenses</em></strong>. You can add and view your company's licenses to Kaspersky Lab products on the "Licenses" tab of your CompanyAccount (activation codes or key files for each product). The license provided during registration will be added automatically to your company's CompanyAccount. Key files are not physically stored on CompanyAccount. The system only stores a record about your company's license. Every company employee with a personal account linked to your company's CompanyAccount has access to the list of licenses. Your CompanyAccount Administrator can remove your company's licenses by deleting them from the list.</p>
<p><strong><em>Contracts</em></strong>. If your company purchases additional customer support services, then after the purchase has been recorded you will be able to view the list of purchases services on the "Contracts" tab. The list of contracts will be available to those company employees who were designated as authorized to use the paid service at the time of purchase. These people will automatically receive notifications about the expiration of the contract.</p>
<p><strong><em>Customer support requests. </em></strong>If you contact Customer Support or the Anti-Virus Lab team for support through CompanyAccount, we may ask you to submit information we may require for providing assistance to you. For example, this may include information about the product associated with your request, computer hardware, your company's network, software, and the nature of the problem you've encountered. Moreover, it may be helpful or even necessary for you to send us the files you are having trouble with or files that define the configuration of your computer or network. You can do this by using the "Attach files" option in the request form. These files may contain user-specific or otherwise personally-identifiable file names, metadata, or content. It is always your choice whether to upload these files. If you would like to upload files, please first view and accept our <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/support/rdp?cid=ca&amp;utm_source=companyaccount.kaspersky.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=company_account&amp;utm_content=en">Regulation on data provisioning</a> on the file upload page. In order to choose the correct customer support department for your request, we will use information about your company's licenses, country, and possibly the interface language selected in your CompanyAccount. Your colleagues may have access to your requests if your CompanyAccount Administrator manually changes the corresponding settings (the Administrator can view requests automatically).</p>
<h3><strong>How long do we keep your personal data</strong></h3>
<p>You can delete your account at any time in the Account settings or by submitting a request to our Technical Support. Once your account has been deleted, your personal data will be held in Kaspersky Lab's database until the retention period has expired, but you will no longer be able to access the CompanyAccount website using the deleted account.</p>
