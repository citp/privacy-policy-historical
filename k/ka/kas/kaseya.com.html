This statement may change from time to time so please check back periodically. By accessing any Kaseya website, downloading any materials from Kaseya websites, purchasing products or services, or by providing any information to Kaseya including via Kaseya Support, Kaseya websites, e-mail addresses, or otherwise, you acknowledge and fully understand Kaseya’s Privacy Statement and consent to the information collection and use practices described herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Statement, do not use Kaseya websites, download any materials from them, purchase products or services or provide information to Kaseya or its affiliated or partner companies.</p>
<p><strong>2. Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Types of Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information Logging</strong>. </p>
Kaseya may track and use information relating to website usage such as: Internet protocol address; kind of browser, operating system or computer used; number of links clicked within a website; state or country from which you accessed the site; date and time of your visit(s); name of your Internet service provider; web page(s) you linked to or from another website; and pages you viewed on a website.
<p><strong>Cookies</strong>. Kaseya may use cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality. We link cookies to personal information on the site in order to make it easier for users to return to the site and to access the Site’s features.</p>
<p>Kaseya reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into Kaseya.com a site that relies on third-party cookies).</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on our Website. </p>
<p><strong>Personal Information. </strong>Personal information is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number or email address. Kaseya may collect or access certain personal information from customers and business partners.

In order to help provide our products, services, or information, we occasionally hire other companies to assist such as providing products or services, handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We may access and/or disclose any information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with any law, judicial, proceeding, government request, court order, legal process, rule or regulation or any process served on Kaseya; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Kaseya (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances or emergencies.

<p>You can stop the delivery of promotional e-mail or other Kaseya communications by following the instructions in the e-mail you receive or by contacting Kaseya at <a href="mailto:webmaster@Kaseya.com">webmaster@kaseya.com</a>. These choices do not apply to the receipt of mandatory product or service communications that are considered part of certain Kaseya products or services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the product or service. Furthermore, Kaseya does not require that you provide Kaseya with personal information. The decision to provide personal information is voluntary. If you do not wish to provide the personal information requested, however, you may not be able to proceed with the activity or receive the benefit for which the personal information is being requested.</p>
<p><strong>4. Accessing And Changing Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>You may have the ability to view or edit your personal information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@kaseya.com">webmaster@kaseya.com</a>, and we will contact you to enable you to access your information and the opportunity to change or delete your information. To protect your privacy and security, we may require steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting access to your data.</p>
<p><strong>5. Third Party Policies</strong></p>
<p>Related offerings with links from Kaseya’s websites have their own privacy policies that can be viewed by clicking on the corresponding links within each respective website. All Kaseya partners are encouraged to participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of participating third parties, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of those sites. We recommend and encourage that you always review the privacy policies of other third parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with such parties.</p>
<p><strong>6. Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Kaseya does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If Kaseya learns that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online. You should instruct children to never give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult, monitor the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate and review privacy policies to understand how your child’s information is treated.</p>
<p><strong>7. Security</strong></p>
<p>Kaseya takes information security very seriously and uses reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access. We use a variety of security technologies depending on the situation and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure such as physical access controls, Secure Socket Layers (SSL), Internet firewalls, intrusion detection, and network monitoring. However, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of your Information or assume liability for improper access to it. By using the Kaseya web site, or providing Information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically about any matter including regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues.</p>
<p>If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.</p>
<p><strong>8. Use of Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>Kaseya web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>
<p>Kaseya may also employ web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of our sites. We prohibit web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information.</p>
<p>Finally, we may work with other companies that advertise on Kaseya sites to place web beacons on their sites in order to allow us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Kaseya site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site.</p>
<p><strong>Flash LSOs</strong></p>

Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.
