Kaspersky VirusDesk is a web page designed to scan files and URLs for viruses and provide you with scanning results, to help us improve our detection methods in your best interest and at the same time provide you with additional information regarding any files or URLs that might in fact either be:

  1. a) malicious, but which Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus software has not detected and/or rated as malicious (“Infected”), or
  2. b) clean, but which Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus software has erroneously rated as malicious (“False Alarm”).



For this purpose, Kaspersky VirusDesk allows you to upload a file (of up to 50 MB of size) to our servers or to provide us with a URL address to have them checked for known potential malware infection and to allow our experts at Kaspersky Anti-Virus Lab to perform further scans and analyses of the content in that regard.

We at Kaspersky Lab respect your desire to protect personal information. Therefore, we will only gather and use personal information required for a full-scale operation of Kaspersky Virus Desk.

You make all decisions regarding whether or not to provide personal data. However, please note that if you do not wish to provide the necessary information, you may not be able to use Kaspersky Virus Desk. For example, if a file you want to upload for scanning contains personal data, it is solely your responsibility to assess and decide whether you want to and are allowed to share the data with us. We at Kaspersky Lab will solely use such data for the purpose of scanning and analyzing it for possible malware infection, but we cannot take responsibility regarding your right to share them with us in the first place.

If you like to receive feedback regarding the possible malware infection of information you have provided to us, you can enter your e-mail address after clicking on “I want to get check results by email”.

For example, this may include information about the product associated with your request, computer hardware, your company's network, software, and the nature of the problem you've encountered. Moreover, it may be helpful or even necessary for you to send us the files you are having trouble with or files that define the configuration of your computer or network. You can do this by using the "Attach files" option in the request form. These files may contain user-specific or otherwise personally-identifiable file names, metadata, or content.It is always your choice whether to upload these files.

In order to choose the correct customer support department for your request, we will use information about your company's licenses, country, and possibly the interface language selected in your CompanyAccount.
