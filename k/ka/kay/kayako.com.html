</div>
<div id="cookies">
<h4>5. &nbsp;Our Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, Web Analytics Services, and Links</h4>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong>. Many of our web pages use “cookies.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personal data, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.

To learn more about your ability to manage cookies, please consult the privacy features in your browser.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong>. Our Company and third parties may also use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These “web beacons” may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our Company’s cookie requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Web Analytics Services</strong>. We use Google Analytics, a service for the marketing analysis of the site provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to allow us to see how you use our site so we can improve your experience.
