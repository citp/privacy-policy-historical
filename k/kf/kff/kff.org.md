**We do not share or otherwise disclose any personal information, including your name, address, or email addresses with other organizations. Only Foundation staff and our authorized agents have access to personally identifiable information provided by visitors to our site.

**Browser information collected on our websites:**  
Like many website operators, the Kaiser Family Foundation analyzes its websites’ logs to review standard information (such as number of hits to individual pages) to improve our websites and tailor them to the needs of our visitors. We use a third-party service to provide real-time reporting of browser accesses to our site to us and our authorized agents. We do not use this service to gather, request, record, require, collect or track any Internet users’ personally identifiable information.

**Privacy of our email lists:  
**The Kaiser Family Foundation maintains several email lists to keep email subscribers informed about recent publications and the latest developments in health policy. Individuals who provide optional information may also receive materials by mail or be contacted by telephone. We do not share email addresses or optional information with anyone outside of the Foundation staff or its authorized agents. Only Foundation staff and our authorized agents have access to personally identifiable information provided by visitors to our site. 

Subscribers may opt out of further email communication at any time by sending a request to [KaiserFamilyFoundationSubscriptions@kff.org](mailto:KaiserFamilyFoundationSubscriptions@kff.org) or by visiting Kaiser Family Foundation’s [email sign-up page](http://kff.org/email/) and managing their subscription preferences.

In addition, the Kaiser Family Foundation and its affiliates may maintain a presence on outside websites and social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

**Children’s privacy:  
**Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the [Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA)](http://www.coppa.org/). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children. It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information pertaining to children. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the notification, we will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from our servers.

If you wish to notify us of our receipt of information by children, please do so through our [feedback form](https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.wordpress.com/contact-us/ "Contact Us").

**Security:  
**The Kaiser Family Foundation employs physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect our site from the loss or misuse of information that we have collected from you. ****

**Enforcement:**  
We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.

**Changes:**  
From time to time, our Privacy Policy may change to improve how we interact with our website’s visitors. Should any changes be made to our policies, we will post them on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide more prominent notice on our website.
