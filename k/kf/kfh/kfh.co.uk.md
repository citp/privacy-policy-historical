This policy applies to users of our services and visitors to our sites.

By using our services or visiting our sites, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you are consenting to us gathering and processing information about you in accordance with this Policy, although consent may not be required for all of the elements described in this Policy.

This Policy covers the information we collect about you when you use our services, visit our sites, or otherwise interact with KFH. This Policy also explains your rights over your personal data including how you can object to certain uses of information about you and how you can access and update certain information about you.

#### What personal data we collect

By using our services or visiting our sites, we may collect the following personal information: name, email address, telephone number and postal address. Depending on the service you are engaging with, we will collect other information relevant to and necessary for us to provide that service. For certain services, bank details or credit card information may be required.

We do not collect personal data considered as sensitive personal data such as health related information except when required for employees of KFH.

In addition, we may receive certain categories of personal data and some device information (such as your name, email, browsing history on our sites and other details) from sources other than you, such as from third party sites, applications and services.

#### How we use your personal data

We may use your information for the following purposes: to provide you with services and fulfil your requests, to provide the functionality offered on our site, to pay for services, to respond to or follow up on enquiries, to tailor your experience on our site including displaying relevant properties, to provide information and services to our customers, to perform statistical analysis, to protect against fraudulent, unauthorised or illegal activity, to comply with our policies, procedures and legal obligations and as otherwise consented to by you and as required or permitted by applicable law.

If you do not provide us with certain information, we may not be able to fulfil your request or provide certain services.

Generally we do not perform automated decision taking or ‘profiling’ by solely automatic means; there is human intervention in our processing and decision making.

#### Legal bases for processing personal data

When you engage with KFH, there are a number of legal bases under which we may request, process and use your data, including:

  * Asking for your consent to receive email marketing and to refer you to use our Londonwide Conveyancing, Financial Services or Survey services. Your consent is not assumed and you can withdraw or change your consent at any time.
  * Where we have a legal duty, such as complying with anti-money laundering legislation
  * To enable us to fulfil a contract
  * Legitimate interest, for example where we discuss related services or provide you with the details of properties to help with your property search. When you register your property search with KFH, you will be sent properties listed with surrounding branches to ensure we can best service your request and find you the right property.



Where the provision of data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or necessary to enter into or fulfil a contract, we will make this clear in our terms and conditions and contracts. Should the requested data be refused, it may not be possible to proceed with the service required.

#### Aggregated information

We may aggregate personal information collected from you and other customers as well as device information and location information (with your consent, where required) to provide general statistics that cannot be linked to you or any other specific user and with which we attempt to provide you with a better experience to improve our services.

#### Retention periods

We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Policy and as otherwise needed to comply with applicable law and internal company policies. The length of time between transactions in the industry has been taken into account when determining how long data is retained for.

#### How we protect your personal data

KFH values your privacy and data security. We use third party services to help maintain the security and performance of our systems and sites. Email monitoring software and network traffic firewalls are also used. You can be assured that any personal data we gather about you through our sites, email, social media, telephone or other means will not be passed on to any third party or organisation except in the instances outlined above.

We will never change our bank details during the course of a transaction. Always query emails supposedly from us where the sender’s email address does not match our domain kfh.co.uk, or where the format, style or content is not usual. We will always check when we receive an instruction to amend our record of a customer’s details.
