<h1>With whom does KFC share the information?</h1>
<p>KFC may share any Personal Information which it collects with any of its group companies.  Your personal information will be made available for the purposes mentioned above (or as otherwise notified to you from time to time), on a ‘need-to-know' basis and only to responsible corporate staff who properly need to know these details to carry out our functions.</p>
<p>As part of achieving the processing purposes set out above, your personal information may also be made available to third party organisations providing relevant services to us under contract. For example, this may include working with third party data processing companies to support the Sites' technical operations or execute a specific promotion or program (such as providing responses to the guest comments page, conduct surveys, or maintain a database of visitor information, etc). These companies may use information about you to perform their functions on our behalf.</p>
<p>As KFC and its group companies operate globally, it may be necessary to transfer your Personal Information to third parties based outside the European Economic Area for the purposes set out above. We will ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Information. By submitting your Personal Information, you agree to this transfer, storing and other processing.</p>
<p>This policy applies if KFC shares your Personal Information with any of its group companies. If you choose to provide your Personal Information directly to KFC's group companies through their respective websites, then their additional Privacy Policies will apply and should also be reviewed by you.</p>
<p>KFC will not disclose any Personal Information to third parties except as set forth in this policy. If Personal Information is shared with any third party for the purposes of executing a specific promotion or program, it will be clearly communicated to visitors that the third party will have no right to use the Personal Information for independent purposes. In support of this policy, KFC will enter into written agreements with any third party receiving Personal Information requiring the third party to comply with KFC's privacy policies and applicable laws.</p>
<h1>How can I stop receiving notices about future offers or to stop my Personal Information from being shared with third parties or from being sent outside the European Economic Area?</h1>
<p>Please let us know by writing to us at the address given at the bottom of this policy. In addition, each time we send you marketing information by e-mail or SMS text messaging, we will provide an opportunity for you to unsubscribe from receiving further information from us.</p>
<h1>How do I correct or update my Personal Information?</h1>
<p>You control the accuracy of your Personal Information. If your Personal Information changes, please correct, update or delete/deactivate it by writing to us at the address given at the bottom of this policy.</p>
<h1>How does KFC protect the security of my Personal Information?</h1>
<p>KFC uses appropriate security measures to protect all Personal Information collected in a secure, controlled environment.</p>
<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our Sites or App(s), you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, We cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Sites or App(s); any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, We will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<h1>Do KFC's Sites and App(s) link to other sites?</h1>
<p>Yes. The Sites and App(s) may contain links to other websites that may not be owned or operated by KFC. KFC cannot control nor is responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites. KFC encourages you to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to Personal Information collected on the Sites and App(s).</p>
