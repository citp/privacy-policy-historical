		<p>This Privacy Policy applies if Company shares your Personal
			Information collected on this Site with any other Yum Brands members.

		<p class="heading" id="5">How do I correct or update my Personal

			information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to Personal
			Information collected on this Site.</p>


		
		<p class="heading" id="8">How will Company notify me of changes to its
			Privacy Policy?</p>

		<p>Company will post any changes to the Policy on the Site's

			by e-mail to the e-mail addresses on record. Users will then be given
			a choice as to whether or not their Personal Information can be used
			in the new manner.</p>
		<p>In the event that Company goes through a business transition,
			such as a merger, another company acquires Company or its Affiliates,
			or Company sells a portion of its assets, your personal information
			will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred and so We
			will share your information with the purchaser, who may then provide
			you with information on their products and services.</p>
