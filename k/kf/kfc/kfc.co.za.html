<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<p>If any dispute arises between Us regarding any provision of these Terms and Conditions, or its application or termination, then We agree that We will attempt to resolve our dispute informally by means of joint co–operation or discussion between the parties directly involved in the dispute within 5 days after that dispute arises or such extended time period as We may agree to with You.</p>
<p>In the event that We are unable to informally resolve our dispute, that dispute shall be finally resolved in accordance with the Rules of the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa by an arbitrator appointed by the Foundation. Arbitration proceedings shall take place in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permissible by applicable law:</p>
<ul>
    <li>this clause shall constitute your irrevocable consent to the arbitration proceedings, and You shall not be entitled to withdraw your consent or to claim that You are not bound by this clause. We may, at Our discretion, waive this clause and permit Our dispute to be resolved using an alternate dispute resolution process;</li>
    <li>Any award that may be made by the arbitrator:
    <ul>
        <li>shall be final and binding;</li>
        <li>will be carried into effect; and</li>
        <li>may be made an order of any court to whose jurisdiction the parties to the dispute are subject.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Notwithstanding the afore-going, nothing in this clause shall be construed as precluding either party from applying to court for a temporary interdict or other relief of an urgent nature, pending the decision of the award of the arbitrator in terms of this clause. </p>
<p>This clause is severable from the rest of this agreement and shall therefore remain of full force and effect even if this agreement is terminated or cancelled for any reason at any time.</p>
