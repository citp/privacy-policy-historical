            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h2>We collect information in different ways.</h2>

            <ul>
                  <li><strong>We collect information directly from you.</strong> For example, if you register for a promotion or apply for a job. We also collect information if you post a comment or make a request.</li>

                  <li><strong>We collect information from you passively.</strong> We use tracking tools like browser cookies, and web beacons. To learn more about these tools and how you can control them, <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</li>

            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h2>We use information as disclosed and described here.</h2>

            <ul>
                  <li><strong>We use information to respond to your requests or questions.</strong> For example, we might use your information to confirm your registration for a program or contest, or fulfill prizes or premiums in a promotion.

                  <li><strong>We use information to improve our products and services.</strong> We might use your information to customize your experience with us. We may use your information to make our website and products better.</li>

                  <li><strong>We use information for security purposes.</strong> We may use information to protect our company, our customers, or our websites. For example, in the event of a breach, we may use your contact information to contact you about that incident.</li>

                  <li><strong>We use information for marketing purposes.</strong> For example, we might send you information about special promotions or offers.

We may also share information with future subsidiaries or affiliates.</li>

                  <li><strong>We may share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.</strong> For example, we share information with vendors who help us manage our online registration process or who fulfill your purchases. Some vendors may be located outside of the United States.</li>

                  <li><strong>We may share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves.</strong> For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena.

This might include fraud we think has happened during a sweepstakes or promotion.</li>

                  <li><strong>We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business.</strong> For example, if part of our business is sold we may give our customer list as part of that transaction.</li>
