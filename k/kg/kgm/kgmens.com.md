This privacy policy will help you understand what information is collected when you visit the Site or our stores and how that information will be used.

  * Aggregated non-personal information on those pages visitors access.
  * Information volunteered by visitors during registration.

**Sharing Information**

At K&G, we are committed to protecting our relationship with our customers, and we use personally identifiable information that you submitted as part of our own business or that of a parent or affiliate company. From time to time we share aggregate non-personal and personally identifiable information with our parent and affiliates to assist in our marketing and merchandising efforts. In addition, in the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by K&G or any affiliated entity are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, both personally identifiable information and aggregate non-personal information from and/or about our customers may be among the transferred assets.

We may also disclose your personally identifiable information or aggregate non-personal information when (a) we believe the law requires such disclosure, (b) in response to legal process and law enforcement requests, and (c) as necessary to protect the property, interests, and rights of K&G, its parent and affiliates, and others. We also transfer your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties to (a) assist us in managing and maintaining customer information, (b) assist us in our own marketing efforts or (c) administer services on our behalf, such as credit card processing for purchases. We do not, however, authorize those parties to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. That said, we may rent or sell to third parties aggregate non-personal information about visitors to the Site without restriction as to use.

Except as set forth in this policy, at no time will we disseminate personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties for any reason.

Please contact us for any additional questions about the management or use of personally identifiable information, or if you do not wish to have your personally identifiable information shared. See "For Further Information," below for contact information.
