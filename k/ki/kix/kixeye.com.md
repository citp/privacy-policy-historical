**Does KIXEYE use cookies, track IP Addresses or use other passive means to collect information?**

KIXEYE may use cookies and similar tracking devices. A “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that websites often store on a user’s computer. Cookies generally do not include people’s names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user’s computer and to “remember” things about the user’s visit (such as the user’s use of various features on the service). You can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use certain portions of KIXEYE.

KIXEYE may also keep track of your Internet Protocol (IP) and computer MAC addresses for various reasons. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. A computer MAC address identifies one specific piece of hardware.

Other information that may be passively collected by KIXEYE includes log files that record website activity, including how many “hits” a particular web page is getting (a.k.a. “navigational data”). These entries are generated anonymously and enable KIXEYE to assess overall online activity and a user’s browsing habits, track interest in advertised sales, and troubleshoot technical concerns. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you.
