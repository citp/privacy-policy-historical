      As used in this “Privacy Policy”, “Kissmetrics” refers to all websites (including
      <a href="https://www.kissmetrics.com">https://www.kissmetrics.com</a> and
      <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com" title="Blog">http://blog.kissmetrics.com</a>),
      properties, and services owned or operated by Space Pencil, Inc., aka
      Kissmetrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy is part of <a href="/terms">Kissmetrics’ Terms of Use</a>
      and describes the privacy practices of Kissmetrics.  It explains when and
      how Kissmetrics collects end user and client information, including
      Personally Identifiable Information (defined below), how we use such
      information, and the circumstances under which we may disclose such
      information to others.  This Privacy Policy includes the policies that
      Kissmetrics observes for compliance with laws in the United States as well
      as other applicable laws, including those followed regarding the transfer
      of Personally Identifiable Information from the European Economic Area
      (“EEA”) and/or Switzerland to the United States under the U.S. – EU Privacy Shield
      and U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor, respectively (collectively, the “Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield”).

    <p>
      By visiting the Kissmetrics website, visiting a Kissmetrics client website
      that provides notice of its use of Kissmetrics and/or this policy, or
      registering for our service, you acknowledge that you accept and consent
      to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h3>What Types of User Information Does Kissmetrics Obtain?</h3>

    <p>
      <em>Visitors to the Kissmetrics Website.</em> If you are a visitor to the
      Kissmetrics website or a Kissmetrics client (“Client”) who registers or
      signs into the Kissmetrics website (including for purposes of obtaining a
      free trial of Kissmetrics’ services), we may obtain the following types of
      information from you or concerning your computer or device (“Kissmetrics
      Client Information”), which may include information that can itself be used
      to identify and/or contact you (“Personally Identifiable Information”):
    </p>

    <ul class="terms-list">
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>

      <li>Credit card number</li>
      <li>Billing address</li>
      <li>Visitor site preferences</li>
    </ul>

      <p>
        Kissmetrics may also receive certain information that may be provided by
        your browser or mobile device, including:
      </p>

    <ul class="terms-list">
      <li>Browser information</li>

      <li>Mobile device information (e.g., device identifier, mobile operating
        system, etc.)</li>

      <li>Time of visit</li>
      <li>Time of last visit</li>
      <li>
        Referring site, application, or service, including the relevant search
        queries that led you to Kissmetrics’ website
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <em>Visitors to the Kissmetrics Blog.</em> If you wish to access certain functions
      within the <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com" title="Blog">Kissmetrics Blog</a>, such as posting
      comments or registering for webinars, we may ask you to provide information,
      including:
    </p>

    <ul class="terms-list">
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Your website</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <em>Visitors to Kissmetrics’ Clients’ Websites.</em> Our Clients may use customized
      and proprietary Kissmetrics’ code, software and/or services (“Service(s)”)
      to obtain information regarding the activities that users engage in while
      visiting their web pages (“Client User Data”).  When a user visits a website
      that uses Kissmetrics’ Service, Kissmetrics code contained on the website
      contacts Kissmetrics’ servers and enables Kissmetrics to collect Client
      User Data.  Some Clients may also use their own code to obtain Client User
      Data and then send such information to Kissmetrics’ servers.  Client User
      Data may include Personally Identifiable Information, including, but not
      limited to, the types of information listed for Kissmetrics Client
      Information above.
    </p>

    <p>
      Client User Data is stored on Kissmetrics’ web servers and databases
      (including those hosted on third party servers on behalf of Kissmetrics)
      for use in performing analysis and producing reports for the applicable
      Kissmetrics Client.  In addition, Kissmetrics itself uses the Kissmetrics
      Service in order to obtain insights into visitors’ activities on its own
      websites, which include, as of the Effective Date,
      <a href="/">http://www.kissmetrics.com</a> and
      <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com" title="Blog">http://blog.kissmetrics.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kissmetrics’ collection and analysis of Client User Data helps our Clients
      to evaluate and understand how their users are interacting with their
      websites, and potentially, to modify their websites in order to make them
      more valuable or useful for their users.  Kissmetrics’ Clients determine
      the types of Client User Data that are sent to Kissmetrics’ servers for
      analysis.  This data may include or be linked to Personally Identifiable
      Information depending on how the Client uses Kissmetrics’ Services on its
      website(s).  Kissmetrics’ Clients are contractually prohibited from sending
      personally sensitive Client User Data (e.g. personal health information,
      political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs) to Kissmetrics and
      Kissmetrics does not knowingly receive such data.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, Kissmetrics may collect certain information about a Client’s
      visitor’s computer that may be provided by the visitor’s browser.  This
      includes browser information, operating system information, mobile device
      information, IP address, time of visit, and the referring site, application,
      or service.  Such information may be collected and shared with the
      Kissmetrics Client even though not specifically requested by the Client.
    </p>

    <h3>How Do We Use This Information?</h3>

    <p>
      <em>Visitors to the Kissmetrics Website.</em> We use the Kissmetrics Client
      Information, including Personally Identifiable Information, to register
      your account, fulfill your requests, understand how you are engaging with
      Kissmetrics, communicate with you, determine if you are satisfied with the
      Service, process billing for Kissmetrics Services, and personalize your
      experience on the Kissmetrics website and with the Kissmetrics Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may also use Kissmetrics User Information to facilitate the delivery of
      content or advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you, or to
      communicate with you about new or existing products and services or special
      offers.  For more information on opting out of these communications, please
      see the section on “<a href="#controls">User Privacy Controls</a>” below.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Visitors to the Kissmetrics Blog.</em> We may use information you voluntarily
      provide when visiting the Kissmetrics blog to send you e-mail communications,
      such as information on upcoming webinars, and to understand how you are
      engaging with and perceive Kissmetrics’ Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Visitors to Kissmetrics’ Clients’ Websites.</em> Except as described in
      the “<a href="#third_parties">Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</a>”
      section below, Kissmetrics never sells or shares any Client User Data with
      individuals or companies other than the specific Client whose website
      transmitted the Client User Data to Kissmetrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kissmetrics does not collect or aggregate information about end user
      behavior across multiple, different websites that are operated by different
      Clients, nor does it use any Client User Data for purposes of behavioral
      advertising.  However, Kissmetrics may analyze Client User Data in the
      aggregate for purposes of internal research and/or to determine overall
      trends or metrics concerning how users are engaging with websites, and may
      report such general trends publicly, without disclosing any Client User
      Data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Our Client’s Use of Kissmetrics.</em> Kissmetrics contractually requires
      its Clients to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including
      the Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield where it applies, as well as other applicable laws relating
      to privacy and data collection (“Applicable Laws”).  Kissmetrics also
      contractually requires its Clients to obtain any necessary consents from
      visitors to its website(s) for the Client’s use of Kissmetrics’ services,
      comply with all Applicable Laws (including, as an example, the Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield
      where it applies) with respect to the transfer of Personally Identifiable
      Information of  EU or Swiss subjects through the Service, and to post an
      online privacy policy that provides each visitor with clear notice of its
      practices regarding data collection, use, and disclosure (including the
      Client’s use of Kissmetrics), along with a link to the Kissmetrics Privacy
      Policy and to the <a href="#controls">Kissmetrics Service Opt-Out</a>
      (discussed below).
    </p>

    <p>
      Kissmetrics cannot be held responsible for any Client’s failure to make
      these disclosures on its website or for any Client’s use or collection of
      Client User Data that is not permitted under this Privacy Policy or
      otherwise.  For more details on the terms that apply to our Clients’ use
      of the Kissmetrics Service, please see Section 4 (“Privacy”) in the
      <a href="/terms">Kissmetrics Terms of Use</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Kissmetrics’ Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>

    <p>
      <em>Cookies.</em> Kissmetrics uses cookies (small text files that Kissmetrics
      stores locally on your computer) on our Client’s websites for one or more
      of the following purposes: to help identify unique visitors and/or devices;
      assess usage patterns and perform traffic analysis; identify visitor
      preferences; conduct A/B testing; diagnose problems with our servers, and
      otherwise administer the Kissmetrics Service.  Kissmetrics does not use
      methods such as browser cache, Flash cookies, or eTags, for acquiring or
      storing information about end users web browsing activity on Client
      websites or otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on how our Clients use Kissmetrics’ Services, information
      contained in Kissmetrics cookies placed on the computers of end users may
      be linked to Personally Identifiable Information in Kissmetrics’ database.
      This allows our Clients to use the Kissmetrics Service to better analyze
      and measure their users’ interactions with their website and to organize
      activities by the same user on their website across time.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you do not wish to have Kissmetrics place and use cookies on your
      computer, you should set your browser preferences to refuse all cookies
      before accessing Kissmetrics or other websites that may use Kissmetrics.
      Kissmetrics is not responsible for any failure by you or your browser to
      accurately implement or communicate your browser preferences or settings.
      In addition, please be aware that even if you configure your browser
      settings to reject all cookies, your activity on Kissmetrics client
      websites will still be recorded by our Service, unless you
      <a href="#controls">opt out</a> of our Service as set forth below.
      However, your rejection of all cookies will prevent Kissmetrics from
      determining whether or not someone using your computer has previously
      visited the website, i.e., whether or not the visitor is a “unique”
      visitor, and from retrieving any information about your prior activities
      on a Client’s website through information contained in a cookie.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that if you set your browser to reject cookies, some features
      of the websites you visit may be unavailable.  For more information on how
      to reject cookies, see your browser's instructions on changing your cookie
      settings.  Additionally, please note that rejecting cookies may also
      prevent you from <a href="#controls">opting out of our Service</a> because
      that involves placing an opt-out cookie in your browser.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you do not elect to set your browser preferences to refuse cookies, you
      consent to have cookies, including cookies used by Kissmetrics, placed on
      your computer when you visit our Client’s websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Web Beacons.</em> Kissmetrics may also collect certain information
      using Web Beacons. “Web Beacons” are electronic images that may be used on
      Kissmetrics’ Website, in Kissmetrics’ Service, or in our email
      communications. They are used, for example, to count website visits or to
      tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
    </p>

    <a name="third_parties"></a>
    <h3>Disclosure and Transfer of Information to Third Parties</h3>

    <p>
      <em>Service Providers.</em> Information, including Kissmetrics Client
      Information, Client User Data, and any Personally Identifiable Information
      contained therein, may be shared with certain third-party companies and
      individuals that help facilitate technical and administrative aspects of the
      Kissmetrics Service (e.g., credit card processing), or perform functions
      related to the administration of Kissmetrics (e.g. hosting services).
      These third parties perform tasks on our behalf and are contractually
      obligated not to disclose or use Kissmetrics User Information or Client
      User Data for any other purpose, and to employ adequate security measures
      to prevent unauthorized access to such data.  However, Kissmetrics is not
      responsible in the event that Personally Identifiable Information is
      disclosed as a result of a breach or security lapse by any such third
      party.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Kissmetrics Clients.</em> Kissmetrics Clients may share Client User Data
      with service providers (e.g. customer relationship management platforms) that
      perform tasks on behalf of Kissmetrics Clients.  Kissmetrics contractually
      requires the Clients to disclose such practices to its users.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Kissmetrics Partners.</em> If you are a Kissmetrics Client that signed
      up through our Partners Program, your Kissmetrics Client Information may be
      shared with the Partner Program member that signed you up for Kissmetrics’
      Service, provided that, prior to any such sharing, Kissmetrics will obtain
      contractual obligations from the Partner Program Member that it will
      comply with all Applicable Laws with respect to such Kissmetrics Client
      Information.  These Partner Program members may use that information to
      help you setup, adjust, manage, and cancel your account with Kissmetrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Law Enforcement and Legal Process.</em> Kissmetrics also reserves the right
      to disclose any Kissmetrics Client Information or Client User Information
      (including Personally Identifiable Information) to: (i) comply with any
      law, regulation, or legal request; (ii) enforce, apply, or investigate
      breaches of the Terms of Use or other agreements; (iii) respond to client
      requests; or (iv) protect the rights, property, or safety of Kissmetrics,
      our employees, our users, or others.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Change of Control.</em> If Kissmetrics, or substantially all of its assets,
      is acquired by another company or successor entity, Kissmetrics Client
      Information and/or Client User Data will be one of the assets transferred
      or acquired by the purchaser or successor.  You acknowledge that such
      transfers may occur, and that any purchaser of or successor to Kissmetrics
      or its assets may continue to collect, use and disclose your information
      acquired prior to such transfer or acquisition as set forth in this policy.
    </p>

    <a name="controls"></a>
    <h3>User Privacy Controls and Do Not Track Signals</h3>

    <p>
      Clients and Visitors to the Kissmetrics Website.  Kissmetrics offers
      several ways for you to review and update account information that is
      obtained and stored by Kissmetrics, or to change your Kissmetrics
      communication preferences:
    </p>

    <ul class="terms-list">
      <li>
        If you have a Kissmetrics account, you can review or update your account
        information by contacting us at
        <a href="mailto:support@kissmetrics.com" link="Support">support@kissmetrics.com</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        You may unsubscribe to any of our e-mail or direct message communications
        regarding updates or products by following the unsubscribe instructions
        in the body of any message.
      </li>

      <li>
        You may contact us at
        <a href="mailto:privacy@kissmetrics.com" title="Privacy">privacy@kissmetrics.com</a>,
        attn: Kissmetrics Privacy Office.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <em>Do Not Track Signals.</em> Kissmetrics Clients decide whether their
      use of Kissmetrics’ Service is responsive to Do Not Track signals from
      browsers, and whether Kissmetrics will be notified of a Do Not Track signal
      received from a user’s browser.  If a Kissmetrics Client enables the
      forwarding of a Do Not Track signal to Kissmetrics, Kissmetrics will attempt
      to read the signal and will not collect any Client User Data from a user
      visiting that Kissmetrics Client’s website during that session, following
      receipt of the Do Not Track signal.  The Do Not Track signal is
      browser-specific, and will not work for mobile devices.  If a Kissmetrics
      Client does not forward Do Not Track signals to Kissmetrics, then
      Kissmetrics will not have any access to such signals from the Client’s
      users, and such signal will have no effect on Kissmetrics’ collection or
      use of data received from that user during the applicable session(s).
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Visitors to Kissmetrics’ Clients’ Websites.</em> If you wish to opt
      out of Kissmetrics’ collecting Client User Data when you visit Kissmetrics’
      Client Websites, please see the
      <a href="/user-privacy">Kissmetrics' Tracking Opt-Out Instructions</a>
      or opt-out directly below.
    </p>

    <h3 id="optout" name="optout">Opt-in/Opt-out of Kissmetrics Tracking</h3>
    <form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/user-privacy/toggle" method="post"><div style="margin:0;padding:0;display:inline"><input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="✓"><input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden" value="XYpUj5/r0JptpztOFBXBi/H7zn3NOj4uQMZUmwKtwUs="></div>
      <p>
        <input id="opt_out" name="opt_out" type="checkbox" value="yes">
        <label for="opt_out">Yes, I would like to opt out of Kissmetrics tracking.</label>
      </p>
      <p><input class="button-primary" name="commit" type="submit" value="Save"></p>
</form>    <hr>

    <p>
      Unlike the Do Not Track signal described above, which applies only to
      Kissmetrics Clients who have activated the functionality, this opt-out
      mechanism applies to all Kissmetrics Client websites, meaning that no user
      data will be collected about you on any such websites.  Please note that
      if you use a different device or Internet browser than you used when opting
      out of Kissmetrics’ Service, or if you clear your cookies, Kissmetrics will
      not be able to view the opt-out and will collect Client User Data when you
      visit Kissmetrics Client websites.  In these circumstances, you will need
      to revisit the link above from the new browser or device in order to
      reiterate your opt-out decision for that device or browser.
    </p>

    <h3>Email Communications</h3>

    <p>
      We may contact you by e-mail or other equivalent electronic communications
      if you access Kissmetrics products or services.  By registering or using
      Kissmetrics Services, you specifically consent to the receipt of these
      e-mail or text message communications.  If you do not want to receive emails
      or other communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions
      in the body of such communications or notify us by email at
      <a href="mailto:privacy@kissmetrics.com" title="Privacy">privacy@kissmetrics.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h3>

    <p>
      Kissmetrics has implemented reasonable security mechanisms to protect
      Kissmetrics Client Information and Client User Data that is maintained on
      Kissmetrics’ servers from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
      alteration and destruction.  Examples of these security mechanisms include
      limited and password-protected access, high security public/private keys,
      encryption on processed data, and SSL encryption to protect transmission
      of data.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, please keep in mind that no security system is impenetrable. It
      may be possible for third parties to intercept or access Kissmetrics
      Client Information and Client User Data in spite of these measures.
      Kissmetrics cannot guarantee the security of your information and cannot

    <h3>Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield Rights and Dispute Resolution</h3>

    <p>
      Kissmetrics complies with the U.S. - E.U. Privacy Shield framework and the
      U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of
      Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data
      from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  Kissmetrics has
      certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield Privacy Principles of notice,
      choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.
      To learn more about the Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield programs, and to view Kissmetrics’
      certification, please visit
      <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" title="Safe Harbor">

      <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" title="Privacy Shield">
        https://www.privacyshield.gov/
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Kissmetrics is subject to the investigatory and regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
      In certain situations, Kissmetrics may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield individuals have the right to access information held about them and amend or delete it if it is inaccurate.
      Any such requests or inquiries should be directed to the Kissmetrics Privacy Office; contact information is provided above under “<a href="#contact">How to Contact Us</a>”
    </p>

    <p>
      Under Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield individuals must have the choice to opt out of the collection and forward transfer of the data to third parties.
      Kissmetrics' options for doing so are explained under “<a href="#controls">User Privacy Controls</a>”
      Kissmetrics further certifies that it complies with Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield policies regarding the onward transfer of data to third parties.
      Information about onward transfer and disclosure is available under “<a href="#third_parties">Disclosure and Transfer of Information to Third Parties</a>”
    </p>

    <p>
      Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of Personally
      Identifiable Information should be directed to the Kissmetrics Privacy
      Office at the address given above.  Kissmetrics will investigate and
      attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of
      Personally Identifiable Information by reference to the principles
      contained in this Privacy Policy.  For complaints that cannot be resolved
      between Kissmetrics and the complainant, disputes will be resolved pursuant
      to Sections 13.4 through 13.6 of the Terms of Use.  For the avoidance of
      doubt, the dispute resolution procedures will be conducted in English.
    </p>
