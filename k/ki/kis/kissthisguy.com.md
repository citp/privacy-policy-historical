These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the KissThisGuy and affiliated sites.

However, please note that if an advertiser asks KissThisGuy and affiliated sites to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 35-64 who have viewed certain content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of KissThisGuy or affiliated sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.
