          <p>· Information Collection - When you browse any Entercom radio station 
            Web site, you do so anonymously. Personal information -- including 
            your e-mail address -- is not automatically collected. Some of our 
            Web sites, however, may request that you voluntarily supply us with 
            personal information, including your E-mail address for purposes of 
            participating in correspondence, site registration, streaming player 
            registration, membership, making a purchase, contests, online surveys, 
            to contact you as part of a promotion, to meet legal requirements, 
            to keep you informed about products and services in which you may 
            have an interest, and/or to analyze the collected information and 
            use this data for contacts by research firms. For these types of activities 
            we may require your name, e-mail address, gender, zipcode, birthdate 
            or other information. Other optional information may be asked (listener/customer 
            preference information, mailing address, telephone numbers, lifestyle 
            interests, and other demographic information).</p>
          <p>Like many other commercial Web sites, some Entercom web sites may 
            use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information 
            about how our site is used. Please read About Cookies below for more 
            information.</p>
          <p>· We give listeners/customers access to their data online. A listener/customer 
            may change, update or add additional information about themselves 
            at any time through our radio stations' web sites, which offer this 
            feature. If a station does not currently provide this ability, listeners/customers 
            can still change their data profile by contacting the local station. 
            All Entercom radio stations will provide this feature in the near 
            future. <br>
            · We attempt to limit access to listener/customer data to those who 
            specifically need it to conduct their business with the company. While 
            we use security techniques designed to protect our listener/customer 
            data, given constantly changing technologies that may exist, we do 
            not guarantee the security of our listener/customer data. <br>
            · We anonymously track visitor usage of our sites for general marketing 
            purposes, such as determining what information is of most and least 
            interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining the 
            site's technical design specifications and identifying system performance 
            or problem areas. We track this activity utilizing an out-sourced 
            product, WebTrends Live, from WebTrends Corporation.. The Privacy 
            Statement for Visitors to Sites Tracked by WebTrends Live can be found

            past, we may send you E-mail offers, surveys, newsletters or other 
            types of contacts. These are based on information you provided in 
            your membership application, registration forms, in surveys, from 
            information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle,

            to keep in contact with users and provide them with a better interactive 
            experience. We may use your information specifically for the following 
            purposes: to provide easy access every time you return to the site

            our business partners in offering you these products, services and 
            information and may act as an intermediary (for instance, sending

          <p> · The data you provide is used to enhance the services and offers 
            our radio stations bring you. As a result of providing personal information,

            · Other Activity Tracking Some radio stations do monitor click-throughs 
            to URL's found in our email messages. The click-through rate is reviewed 
            in order to: track participation in contests in order to judge effectiveness 
            and to award prizes; track listener interests; track response rates 
            for station marketing purposes or to report to a client in aggregate 
            form only, the response of listeners. Individual activity is never 
            shared with employees or third parties. <br>
            · Children Entercom does not knowingly solicit data from children, 
            and we will not knowingly market to children. Entercom adheres to 
            COPPA - the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Our websites

            any information which is obtained from any child who is under the 
            age of 13. · What else should I know about my privacy? Third party 
            Internet sites and services accessible through Entercom radio stations 
            have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of 
            us. Entercom has no responsibility or liability for these independent 
            policies or actions. In addition, you are solely responsible for maintaining 
            the secrecy of your passwords, membership ID, or any account information. 
            Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. If you 
            post personal information online that is accessible to the public, 
            you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 
            While we aim to protect your personal information, Entercom cannot 
            ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to 
            us, and you do so at your own risk. <br>
            <br>
            We will make all reasonable efforts to adhere to the above privacy 
            standards. However, the policy should not be construed as a contractual 
            undertaking. Additional restrictions may be imposed to comply with
