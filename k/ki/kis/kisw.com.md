                                           Privacy Policy
A Privacy Policy Statement from
Entercom Communications Corp. (“Entercom”)
          The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for
Entercom Radio Station web properties. For a complete list of all Entercom radio station web
sites, please visit www.entercom.com.
y         The Information We Collect
          When you browse any Entercom radio station Web site, you do so anonymously. At
some Entercom sites, you can enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, join
one of our listener clubs, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. In
connection with such activities, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personally
identifiable information. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected
at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, gender,
birth date and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and
services. At certain parts of some of Entercom’s sites, only persons who provide us with the
requested personally identifiable information will be able to participate in programs and services
or otherwise participate in the site’s activities and offerings. We generally provide listener club
members access to certain listener club data online. A listener club member may change, update
or add additional information about themselves online through our radio stations’ web sites
          We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many
of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer),
the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS) and the domain name
of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Comcast).
y         How We Use the Information
          If you provide us with your E-mail address, or have done so in the past, we may send you
E-mail offers, surveys, newsletters or other types of contacts. These are based on information
you provided in your membership application, registration forms, in surveys, from information
that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from
external sources, such as census bureau data. If you have signed up to receive our e-mails and
prefer not to receive marketing information from this site, follow the "unsubscribe" instructions
provided on any marketing e-mail you receive from this site.

          We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when
you have won one of our contests, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to
contact you about your account with us.
          We also use information generally to compile statistical and user profile data, to perform
research using the compiled data including disclosure of user information to research firms
retained by Entercom, to keep in contact with users and provide them with a better interactive
experience. We may use your information specifically for the following purposes: to provide
easy access every time you return to the site without requiring re-entry of registration
information; to keep you informed about products and services in which you may have interest;
to complete business transactions; to contact you as part of a promotion; to allow you to make a
posting on the Site; to administer individual accounts; to provide customer support; to meet legal
requirements; to provide Internet security; and/or to analyze the collected information and use
this data for contacts by research firms. Also, in the event that company or the radio station is
involved in a sale of a substantial portion of our business assets, listener/customer information
may be among the transferred assets.
          We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve
the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We
also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you
products, programs, or services.
          We work closely with our business partners and certain other third parties who may
perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing promotional materials to our
users, sending e-mail, managing data, processing credit card payments or providing customer
service. They have access to your personal information only to the extent necessary to perform
their functions and may not use it for any other purpose. Further, these business partners and
other third parties may from time to time wish to extend special offers to you on their own
behalf. We may use your personal information to assist our business partners in offering you
these products, services and information and may act as an intermediary (for instance, sending
you an e-mail on their behalf).
          Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of
information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will
never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.
          The data you provide is used to enhance the services and offers our radio stations bring
you. As a result of providing personal information, Entercom radio stations can provide a more
customized online experience, making your interaction with us more productive, helpful and fun.
You can also expect to receive occasional communications targeted directly toward your lifestyle
interests.
          Finally, We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process,
for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information
in response to a law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe it is necessary to
investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations

involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or
as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are
acquired by or merged with another company.
y         Cookies & Web Beacons
          To enhance your experience with our sites, many of our web pages use “cookies.”
Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies,
by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information
unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our
sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this
information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
          We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our
sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g., to
recognize you by name when you return to our site) and save your password in password-
protected areas. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.
          “Web beacons” or clear .gifs are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor
the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons
can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a
visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on this site from time to time for this and
other purposes.
y         Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Ad Servers, and Sponsors
          Some of Entercom’s web sites contain links to other sites whose information practices
may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy notices as Entercom

          The Entercom sites covered by this Privacy Notice sometimes may offer content (e.g.,

information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. Entercom has no
control over these third parties’ use of this information. The Entercom site will notify you at the
time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such
information.
          Some of Entercom sites covered by this Privacy Notice may use a reputable third party to
present or serve the advertisements that you may see at its Web pages. These third party ad
servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies to help present such
advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness. The use of
these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is
not covered by our privacy policy. For more about third-party ad servers generally visit the
