<p>Kiip, Inc. ("we," "us," "our," or "Company") knows that you care about how your
personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the
following to learn more about how we use your personal information. By visiting, accessing or
using the Kiip.me website and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or
application services offered from time to time by Company in connection therewith (collectively,
the "Website"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and
policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information
("Personal Information") that Company gathers when you access the Website and when you use
Company’s services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company
does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</strong></p>
<p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our
services, and allows our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to personalize
their experience on the Website. We collect the following types of information from our
customers:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</strong></p>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in
any other way. The types of Personal Information collected in this fashion may include your
email address, IP address, browser information, username, password and any other information
necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain
information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.
The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions,
improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, and
communicating with you about Company’s products and services, including specials and new
features.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with
our Website or use our services. Company automatically receives and records
information on our server logs from your browser including your unique mobile
device ID, IP address, cookie information, browser information, operating system,
timestamps, and the page you requested. In addition, we automatically receive and
record which rewards you have registered and/or redeemed through the Website,
which rewards you have gifted to your friends, which in-game achievements you
have completed for rewards, your location when using the service, and other reward-
related or game-related actions you may take in connection with the Website or our
services.</li>
<li>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers
and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, including reward-
related and gameplay-related information, similar to TV ratings that indicate how
many people watched a particular show. Company only uses this data in aggregate
form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you
personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how customers
use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to
as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of
information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our
customers, collectively, use our Website or services. We share this type of statistical
data so that our partners also understand how people use the Website or services, so
that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Company
never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify
you personally.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer
or device supports this type of functionality. Company uses this confirmation to help us make
emails more interesting and helpful and to improve the Website and our services. We also
compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending
unnecessary messages to our customers. When you receive e-mail from Company, you can opt
out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.</li></ul>
<p><strong>What About Cookies?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s (or other
device’s) persistent storage medium (e.g., hard drive) through your browser to enable
our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are
visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to
learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality.</li>
<li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent
your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication
of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie
in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated,
however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website’s
most attractive features.</li>
<li>Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners,
who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer
or other device each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
information about you or others who use your computer or device. This information
allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they
believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies
by Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</li></ul>

organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
