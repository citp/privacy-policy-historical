<p>Kiip, Inc. ("we," "us," "our," or "Kiip") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about how we use your personal information. By visiting, accessing or using the Kiip.me services , and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered by Kiip (collectively, the "Platform"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy..</p>
<p><strong>KIIP USERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Kiip’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Kiip gathers when you (“user”) access the Platform. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Kiip does not own or control, or to individuals that Kiip does not employ or manage.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES KIIP COLLECT?</strong></p>
<p>The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>
<p>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</p>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Platform or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your email address, IP address, browser or mobile device information, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features – for example, we may need to collect an email address so that we can redeem rewards to you. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as redeeming rewards, answering questions, improving the content of the Platform, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about Kiip’s products and services, including specials and new features. Granting us permission to use your information not only allows us to provide the Platform as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</strong></p>
<p>We receive and store information whenever you interact with our Platform or use our services that describe how you interacted with them. Kiip automatically receives and records information on our server logs including, where applicable, your unique mobile device ID, the application you use where the Kiip Platform is running, IP address, cookie information, device type, operating system, timestamps, and the reward redemption you requested. In addition, we automatically receive and record which rewards you have registered and/or redeemed through the Platform, which rewards you have gifted to your friends, which in-application achievements you have completed for rewards, your location when using the service, and other reward-related or application-related actions you may take in connection with the Platform or our services.</p>
<p>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Platform and its components, including reward- related and gameplay-related information, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how users use parts of the Platform or services so that we can make the Platform appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Platform or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use the Platform or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.</p>
<p><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong></p>
<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Kiip if your computer or device supports this type of functionality. Kiip uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and to improve the Platform and our services. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. When you receive e-mail from Kiip, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.</p>
<p><strong>What About Cookies?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s (or other device’s) persistent storage medium (e.g., hard drive) through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Platform and to improve quality.</p>
<p><strong>WILL KIIP SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</strong></p>
<p>Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share information we receive about you with others unless we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>received your permission;</li>
<li>given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or</li>
<li>removed your name and any other personally identifying information from it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advertisers: As discussed above, we allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and you agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you (including, without limitation, information you may have decided not to show to other users) to select or allow the advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, we may allow an advertiser to target an ad to you based on your reward redemption history, demographics, location, application usage history.</p>
<p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may sell items to you through the Platform. In other situations, Kiip may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we may share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.</p>
<p>Agents: We may use other companies and people to perform tasks to help us run the Platform and sometimes we need to share your information with them to allow them to provide us with the products or services we’ve requested. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.</p>
<p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Kiip, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Kiip goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Kiip or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<p>Protection of Kiip and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Kiip, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
<p><strong>IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</strong></p>
<p>Kiip endeavors to protect user information to ensure that user account information is kept private, however, Kiip cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
<p>The Platform contains links to other sites and services. Kiip is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites and services. When accessing another site or service you should read the privacy policy stated on that site. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Platform.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?</strong></p>
<p>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, even though it may be needed to take advantage of or register for certain features of the Platform and services.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Kiip may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by updating this Privacy Policy or posting an announcement on our Platform or sending you an email. Users are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the Platform after such changes have been first posted.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy on our Platform, please send us a detailed message at privacy@kiip.me. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
