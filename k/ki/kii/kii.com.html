<p>At Kii we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of Kii’s products, software, services or web sites (“Kii services”). We may update the Privacy Policy in the future, and you will be able to find the most current version of this policy at <a href="/en">www.kii.com</a></p>

<p>The United State Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (FAQ) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy European Union (EU) law requirements for adequate protection of personal information transferred from the EEA to the United States. Kii Inc. adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles outlined below.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@kii.com">privacy@kii.com</a> or write to us at:</p>

<h3>NOTICE: INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h3>
<p>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Kii Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>

<h4>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE</h4>
<p>When you sign up for a Kii Account or other Kii service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address, your mobile phone number and an account password). We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Kii services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.</p>

<h4>SESSION IDENTIFIER</h4>
<p>When you visit Kii, we may send a session identifier to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your client. We use session identifiers to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences and improving search result.</p>

<h4>LOG INFORMATION</h4>
<p>When you access or connect to Kii services, our servers automatically record information that your client sends. These server logs may include information such as your service request, Internet Protocol address, platform or browser type, client version ID, client language, the date and time of your request and session identifiers that may uniquely identify your client.</p>

<h4>USER COMMUNICATIONS</h4>
<p>When you send email or other communications to Kii, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</p>

<h4>AFFILIATED KII SERVICES ON OTHER SITES</h4>
<p>We offer some of our services on or through other web sites or through third party service provider. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Kii in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites and providers through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>

<h4>LOCATION DATA</h4>
<p>Kii offers location-enabled services, such as location-aware Kii search for your mobile phone. If you use those services, Kii may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). </p>

<h4>LINKS</h4>
<p>Kii may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and advertising. </p>

<h4>OTHER SITES</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Kii services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that include Kii applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own session identifiers or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.</p>

<p>Kii only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include:</p>

<p>1. Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising</p>
<p>2. Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services</p>
<p>3. Ensuring the technical functioning of our network</p>
<p>4. Protecting the rights or property of Kii or our users and</p>
<p>5. Developing new services.</p>
<br>
<p>You can find more information about how we process personal information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. </p>

<p>Kii processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our service provider partners.</p>

<h3>CHOICES FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>
<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.</p>
<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Kii may not be able to provide those services to you. </p>

<h3>ONWARD TRANSFER</h3>
<p>Kii only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Kii in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<p>1. We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>
<p>2. We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p>3. We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Kii, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
<br>
<p>If Kii becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice when personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who installed a particular application on their mobile, for example, or how often a particular piece of music was played. Such information does not identify you individually.</p>
<p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.</p>

<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Kii employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

<h3>DATA INTEGRITY</h3>
<p>Kii processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>

<h3>ACCESS</h3>
<p>When you use Kii services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.</p>

<h3>ENFORCEMENT</h3>
<p>Kii utilizes the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance with our privacy statement. Kii periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Kii’s treatment of personal information by contacting us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@kii.com">privacy@kii.com</a> or write to us at </p>

<br>

<p>When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Kii’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Kii and an individual.</p>

<h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the bottom of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions (<a href="/en/privacy">www.kii.com/privacy/archive</a>) of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>

<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@kii.com">privacy@kii.com</a> or write to us at </p>
