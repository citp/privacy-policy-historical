</p>

<p><b>WHEN YOU VISIT KIPLINGER.COM.</b> Our server automatically recognizes the IP address of visitors.

However, this information is not compiled or used for any purpose other than to communicate with you.</p>

<p><b>WHEN YOU PARTICIPATE IN AN ONLINE SURVEY.</b> We may share survey information about our users with advertisers and business partners. However, we keep and share only aggregate numbers. For example, we will say x percent of our users are females and y percent males. We do not reveal any individual information about you.</p>

<p><b>WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR E-MAIL UPDATES AND COLUMNS.</b> Kiplinger promotions, as well as outside advertising, will appear on e-mail alerts.

<p><b>OUR POLICY ON “COOKIES.”</b> Kiplinger.com may place a "cookie" in a file on your computer. The cookie itself does not collect or reveal any personally identifying information about you. The company that serves ads on our Website uses cookies for various tracking purposes. You always have the option of disabling cookies via your browser preferences.</p>

<p><b>THIRD PARTY USE. </b> We use third parties, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to deliver ads to you on our behalf. They also may collect and use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Services and other Web sites in order to present advertisements that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>.</p>

<p><b>IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO A KIPLINGER PUBLICATION.</b> Kiplinger never releases e-mail addresses, but if you supply us with your postal address when signing up for any of Kiplinger's print publications, you should be aware that from time to time we do make our subscriber list available for rent to carefully screened companies for a one-time use in direct mail solicitations. If you are a print subscriber and would rather not receive such solicitations, send your mailing label to P.O. Box 3292, Harlan, IA 51593-0472, and instruct Kiplinger to exclude your name.</p>

<p><b>EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES.</b> In addition to the above circumstance, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to legal process, (iii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
