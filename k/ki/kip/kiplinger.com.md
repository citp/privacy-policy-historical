Kiplinger.com respects your privacy. We do not release your e-mail address to anyone or any company.

We may make content or services from other Web sites including our affiliated or co-branded Web sites available to you from links located on Kiplinger.com. These other Web sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such Web site to determine how that site protects your privacy.

Following are the specifics of how we protect your privacy.

## When You Visit Kiplinger.com

Our server automatically recognizes the IP address of visitors. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors and subscribers use and navigate our Web sites, including the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each Web page, and the length of their visits. We share them with no one.

## When You Fill Out a Form on Kiplinger.com

When information is provided via feedback forms, we collect all of the information you provide, including your e-mail address and the type of browser being used. However, this information is not compiled or used for any purpose other than to communicate with you.

## When You Participate in an Online Survey

We may share survey information about our users with advertisers and business partners. However, we keep and share only aggregate numbers. For example, we will say x percent of our users are females and y percent males. We do not reveal any individual information about you.

## When You Sign Up For Email Updates and Columns

Kiplinger promotions, as well as outside advertising, will appear on e-mail alerts. From time to time, Kiplinger may send you e-mail notifications about new or existing products and services, new web site features, special offers, or to otherwise contact you. 

## If You Do Not Wish to Receive Emails From Us

All our free email alert services and special offer emails include an unsubscribe link at or near the bottom of the email. To unsubscribe, simply follow the link and enter your preferences. For more information, please see the contact information at the bottom of this page. 

### Your Ability to Choose

We offer you the opportunity to choose whether to receive marketing information from Kiplinger if you sign up for an e-mail alert. If you subscribe to an e-mail alert, you may update your communication preferences by visiting our E-Mail Alert Sign Up page ([http://www.kiplinger.com/email](https://web.archive.org/login/register.php)).

## Our Policy on "Cookies"

Kiplinger.com may place a "cookie" in a file on your computer. The cookie itself does not collect or reveal any personally identifying information about you. The company that serves ads on our Website uses cookies for various tracking purposes. You always have the option of disabling cookies via your browser preferences.

## Third Party Use

We use third parties, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to deliver ads to you on our behalf. They also may collect and use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Services and other Web sites in order to present advertisements that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>.

## When You Click a Link to Another Web Site

This Web site contains links to other sites, including advertiser sites, and content partners. These sites are not under our control and so are not covered by our Privacy Policy statement. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such Web site to determine how that site protects your privacy.

## When You Participate in a Forum

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) in the forums or during a chat, that information can be collected and used by others not connected with Kiplinger, and may result in unsolicited messages from them. 

## If You Subscribe to a Kiplinger Publication

Kiplinger never releases e-mail addresses, but if you supply us with your postal address when signing up for any of Kiplinger's print publications, you should be aware that from time to time we do make our subscriber list available for rent to carefully screened companies for a one-time use in direct mail solicitations. If you are a print subscriber and would rather not receive such solicitations, send your mailing label to P.O. Box 3292, Harlan, IA 51593-0472, and instruct Kiplinger to exclude your name.

## Policy Modifications

When we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, we will inform you by posting a notice on the home page of this site that the policy has been updated and by changing the date on this page noting when the policy was last updated.

## Exceptional Circumstances

In addition to the above circumstance, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to legal process, (iii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
