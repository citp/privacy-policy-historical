Kiplinger.com is committed to protecting your privacy. Please read the information below to understand how we use the information we collect from you and your choices in how we manage your information.

We may make content or services from other websites, including our affiliated or cobranded websites, available to you from links located on Kiplinger.com. These other websites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such website to determine how that site protects your privacy. 

Following are the specifics of how we protect your privacy.

## When You Visit Kiplinger.com

Our server automatically recognizes the IP address of visitors. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors and subscribers use and navigate our websites, including the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each Web page, and the length of their visits. Our goal in aggregating and analyzing user data is to improve the site experience for the user and target relevant advertising messaging and content to appropriate interests. 

### Our Policy on "Cookies"

Kiplinger uses cookies and similar technologies when you use our websites and related web pages.

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files, which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie will help our website, or another website, to recognize your device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files can also do the same thing. We use the term "cookies" in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way. We only use cookies in accordance with applicable law.

Cookies serve many functions. For example, they help us to remember your login data, authentication data, and other essential information. Cookies also help us to remember nonessential information such as your preferences, analyze how well our website is performing, or recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.

Certain cookies contain personal data. For example, if you click to "remember me" when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our website, or a user’s general location.

### What sort of cookies and other tracking technologies do we use?

Generally, our cookies and similar tracking technologies perform the following different functions: 

  1. Essential/Required Cookies: These cookies are essential for the core operation of our website and are automatically enabled when you use the website.
  2. Performance Cookies: These cookies help to improve the performance of the website and provide a better user experience. This allows us to provide you with a high quality experience by customizing our website and content to your interests. Performance cookies also help us quickly identify and fix any issues that arise. For example, we use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are producing error messages.
  3. Online Behavioral Cookies: These cookies are used by BlueConic, our online engagement software. The BlueConic Services Platform progressively builds an individual customer profile across several channels, from first touch of an anonymous visitor building up to a known customer in a CRM system, with all real-time channel switches and necessary identity transfers and mergers in between. This allows us to dynamically segment these individuals based on their profiles. Then the BlueConic Services Platform serves the most relevant content on our website or initializes online interactions.
  4. Other Tracking Technologies: We and our marketing partners, affiliates, video, analytics or customer support service providers also use beacons, tags, and scripts to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.



## Children’s Privacy

Kiplinger understands and endorses the importance of protecting children’s privacy, especially in an online environment. In particular, Kiplinger’s website is not designed for or directed at children under the age of 18. It is our policy never to knowingly collect or retain personal data about anyone under the age of 18. If Kiplinger obtains any knowledge about personal information that relates to anyone under the age or 18, we will remove those from our systems.
