<font size="5"><b>KidsCom.com Privacy Policy</b></font>
</center>
<br><br>
For more than seven years, KidsCom.com has been striving to create safe, educational and entertaining electronic playgrounds for kids 4 to 15. In that time, kids, parents and teachers from more than 120 countries around the world have joined us. Our mission is to give kids a voice to the world and to each other around the world through a variety of engaging activities. 
<br><br>
Anyone can play on KidsCom.com. It is free and KidsCom.com Club registration is not required. Some areas of the site, however, are reserved for registered KidsCom.com Club Kids who have obtained their parent's permission. 
<br><br>
KidsCom.com follows the FTC guidelines for compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and Rule. Verifiable parental permission is required prior to the collection of any personal information. 
<br><br>
No personal information provided to KidsCom.com by its registered KidsCom.com Club users is sold or rented to any third parties. 
<br><br>
<b>KidsCom.com News newsletter registration</b>
<br>
Kids can sign-up to receive the KidsCom.com News e-mail newsletter even if they aren't registered as a KidsCom.com Club Kid. The newsletter contains information on KidsCom.com's games, contests and more. To sign-up, kids are required to provide their e-mail address and their parent's e-mail address. The parent's e-mail address is only used to notify parents that their child has signed-up for the newsletter and to give parents the chance to delete their child's e-mail address from the mailing list. The child's e-mail address is only used to send them the KidsCom.com News newsletter. A child or their parent can delete the child's e-mail address from the newsletter mailing list at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions included in all newsletters.
<br><br>
<b>KidsCom.com Club registration</b>
<br>
<b>Who needs to register? </b>
<br>
KidsCom.com Club registration is not required to play on and explore most of KidsCom.com. Registering as a KidsCom.com Kid is only required for kids who want to chat on KidsCom.com, earn KidsKash for cool stuff in the Loot Locker, answer KidsKash Questions, join the Find a Key Pal program and be included in other special activities and promotions. KidsCom.com does not require, as a condition of participation, any KidsCom.com Kid to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary for them to participate in an activity. 
<br><br>
<b>What info is collected?</b> 
<br>
When a visitor to KidsCom.com wants to post something on the site (like on our monitored message boards or weekly creative writing challenges), we ask kids to provide info that is not personally identifiable (first name only, age and the country they live in). This information is included with their posted content and not used for any other purposes. All postings to KidsCom.com are screened by adult staff members before appearing on the site to help ensure children's online safety and privacy. Users are not allowed to post any personally identifiable information. 
<br><br>
When a kid wants to become a registered KidsCom.com Kid, we ask their parents to provide the following information on the parent's permission form: 
<ul>
<li> Child's first and last name 
</li><li> Child's date of birth 
</li><li> Child's gender and country
</li><li> Child's e-mail address 
</li><li> Parent's name 
</li><li> Parent's e-mail address 
</li><li> Parent's Signature 
</li></ul>
This information is requested regardless of the age of the child. 
<br><br>
KidsCom.com uses this information to create and maintain separate KidsCom.com Club registration records for each child. E-mail addresses are used to communicate with KidsCom.com Kids and their parents about activity on the site and other features.  Gender and Country are asked to help us develop the most appropriate content for our visitors.  None of this information is sold or rented to any third parties. 
<br><br>
We encourage parents to be involved with all of their child's online activities. 
<br><br>
Registered KidsCom.com Club Kids who have their parent's permission to be in the Find a Key Pal Program, also can share their favorite TV show and music group, their hobbies and what they want to be in the future. This information is shared only with other kids and during the search process of the Find a Key Pal program. Answering these questions is optional. 
<br><br>
All personal information collected on KidsCom.com is done so directly from the parent or child. 
<br><br>
The KidsCom.com site may contain links to sites of sponsors and advertisers whose privacy policy and practices are different than our own.  It is important for KidsCom.com visitors to always review a site's privacy policy before releasing any personal information.  This includes content and promotions featured on the KidsCom.com site.  At no time will KidsCom.com release any personal information we collect to a third-party site without the written permission of parents.
<br><br>
KidsCom.com uses every means available to safeguard the personal information of our Club members and site visitors, including a secure physical location and a protected electronic environment.

<br><br>
<b>What areas on KidsCom.com require KidsCom.com Club registration? </b>
<br><br>
<b>KidsCom.com KidsChat</b>—Kids can chat on the fully monitored KidsCom.com KidsChat seven days a week, from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Central time. All conversations are monitored as they happen by KidsCom.com's staff of trained adult chat monitors. Private messaging between kids is not allowed. And KidsCom.com Kids are not permitted to share any information that will personally identify them. If they do share personally identifiable information or ask another kid for that information, they will be kicked off KidsChat. 
<br><br>
<b>Idea Seeker Plant Babies™</b>—Registered kids can sprout and care for their very own Idea Seeker Plant Babies.  Kids earn virtual points by playing certain educational games and fun activities on the KidsCom.com site.  Kids then use their virtual points to take care of the needs of their Plant Babies.  To allow kids of all ages to participate, different Plant Babies require different levels of skill, care and attention.  Idea Seeker Plant Babies help kids fight the Darkness of Dumbness and the Clouds of Chaos.
<br><br>
<b>Find a Key Pal Program</b>—This program, popular with classroom teachers, allows kids to find electronic pen pals from around the world. Only kids with a parent's permission can participate in the program. When kids search for a Key Pal, they'll be given the first name, hometown and country of their Key Pal, plus an e-mail address and other fun facts kids have provided (such as favorite TV show or music group, hobbies, etc.). Kids can have as many Key Pals as they want, but this information is given out just one child at a time to prevent anyone from getting a large number of names at once. This is the only area on KidsCom.com where a child's e-mail address is allowed to be shared. We strongly encourage parents to responsibly monitor their child's e-mail activities. 
<br><br>
<b>KidsKash Points and the Loot Locker</b>—Registered kids can earn KidsKash Points by playing educational games or getting involved in other areas of the KidsCom.com site. These points can be redeemed in our Loot Locker, a collection of kids' merchandise and services contributed by a variety of companies (those companies have no access to KidsCom.com Club registration information). KidsCom.com Club registration is required for earning KidsKash Points so we can accurately track each child's point totals. 
<br><br>
<b>KidsKash Questions</b>—Registered KidsCom.com Kids can participate in occasional surveys in this area, which we use to gauge kids opinions on social, educational and marketing issues and topics. The responses from KidsKash Questions help guide our development of KidsCom.com and let us understand the topics that are on kids' minds. They also help other companies learn about kids. The results of all surveys we do are always reported in general, or aggregate, terms. We never break down the information to a point where individual children could be identified. 
<br><br>
We do not release, sell or in any way provide the names or identities of KidsCom.com Kids to any marketers. We do not now and we never have. 
<br><br>
<b>Does KidsCom.com use cookies?</b> 
<br><br>
<b>What is a cookie?</b> 
<br>
A cookie is a small file that Web sites place on your computer to keep track of some information. On KidsCom.com, cookies do not store any personally identifiable information about you. You do not have to accept the cookies. In most cases, everything will work fine (just a little slower) if you do not accept the cookies. However, to earn KidsKash Points while playing some games on KidsCom.com you need to accept cookies. 
<br><br>
<b>Where are cookies used on KidsCom.com?</b>
<br> 
Cookies are used in two ways on KidsCom.com. KidsCom.com only uses cookies with registered users and does so only to improve the site functionality for registered users or where it is necessary to complete a particular activity. 
<br><br>
First, cookies are used to keep log-in information in some areas so that registered users can access the site faster. These cookies contain a unique ID number so you can get into areas faster, instead of waiting for our computer to sort through all the different people in our records. These cookies do not track any of your other online activities and do not contain any personally identifiable information. These cookies expire after a certain amount of time and delete themselves from your computer. 
<br><br>
Second, cookies are used during some games and activities on KidsCom.com. These are used only when registered users play games for KidsKash Points to keep track of your score. The cookie is created at the beginning of the game. When the game is over, the cookie deletes itself. These cookies do not store any personal information about you and do not track any of your other online activities. 
<br><br>
Some of our advertisers may use cookies on our site. KidsCom.com requires those partners to be in full compliance with federal guidelines for children's online safety and privacy. Those cookies cannot be used to collect any personal information from our users. 
<br><br>
<b>How can parents update and delete info?</b> 
<br>
KidsCom.com Kids and parents can view, correct, update and delete personal information provided in the KidsCom.com Club registration process at any time. They will need the registered child's first name, last name, date of birth and password. Visit the KidsCom.com Club registration update page at <a href="http://www.kidscom.com/cgi-bin/registration/kc/kc_register.pl">http://www.kidscom.com/cgi-bin/registration/update.pl</a> for more information. 
<br><br>
To change the e-mail address used to subscribe to the KidsCom.com News newsletter, unsubscribe the current address by following the directions provided in the newsletter and re-subscribe to the newsletter using the new e-mail address at <a href="http://www.kidscom.com/cgi-bin/newsletter/kc/kcemailsignup.pl">http://www.kidscom.com/cgi-bin/newsletter/kc/kcemailsignup.pl</a>. 
<br><br>
Parents can prevent further collection or use of their child's personal information by deleting that child's registration on the KidsCom.com Club registration update page at <a href="http://www.kidscom.com/cgi-bin/registration/kc/kc_register.pl">http://www.kidscom.com/cgi-bin/registration/update.pl</a> or by unsubscribing the child from the KidsCom.com News newsletter by following the directions contained in the newsletter. 
<br><br>
<b>Who can parents contact if they have more questions?</b>
