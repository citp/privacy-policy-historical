	<div><h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p class="noMargin">Children's privacy is important to us at Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. ("we," "us," "our"). We are committed to safeguarding children's personal information submitted on our online and mobile Web sites, services, and applications ("Site" or "Sites") and to helping parents or guardians and children learn how to exercise control over personally identifiable information while exploring our Sites.</p><p>
</p><p>To help ensure a rewarding online experience for our Site visitors, we provide this summary of our information practices. This Privacy Policy governs the collection and use of information at our Sites where this policy is posted.</p>
<h4>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
<p class="noMargin">To enable children to participate in some of our online activities, we may ask them to provide us with their first name, hometown, and e-mail address. For other activities that include enhanced interactive features, such as virtual worlds where the child can play games, chat with their friends, and redeem points, we may require the child to create an account with us. This account may require additional information, such as a username, password, and the e-mail address of the child's parent or guardian so we can take additional actions, including (1) letting the parent or guardian know of the child's interest in the activity; (2) asking the child's parent or guardian for permission to participate in that activity; or (3) providing instructions to the parent or guardian on how to register and activate their child's account.</p>
<p>We may also offer our Site visitors the opportunity to make purchases, such as merchandise or gifts for friends or family, redeem virtual points, or participate in certain interactive features that may require visitors to provide full name, billing and mailing addresses, e-mail address, telephone number, and a credit card number. If an order is being shipped to a third party, we will also need the recipient's name and mailing address. Before collecting information in connection with an e-commerce order, we may verify the validity of the purchaser's credit card. On occasion, we might solicit additional voluntary information regarding shoppers' personal shopping preferences.</p>
<p>On some areas of our Sites, children may want to communicate with their friends, so we may ask the child to provide personal information about other people. This is usually limited to a first name and e-mail address.</p>
<p>We also collect certain website information when visitors use our Sites, such as the type of computer or mobile operating system (e.g., Windows or Mac OS) and browser (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, mobile Internet browser) used to access our Site, mobile carrier, domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., AT&amp;T, Earthlink), certain identifiers such as unique device identifier, IP address, and mobile device IP address, usage information (such as page requests and average time spent on our Site) and other information described in this Policy to help improve the design, functionality, performance, and content of our Sites.</p>
<p>Our mobile device applications do not collect information about the location of a mobile device, and only would do so if a visitor is specifically prompted and provides his or her consent. Visitors may also choose to receive push notifications.  Visitors can always manage their notification and location preferences at any time by adjusting the settings on their mobile device.</p>
<p>If visitors no longer wish to have information collected by an application installed on the mobile device, they may uninstall the application by using the standard uninstall processes available on the mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>
<p>If visitors interact with us through third-party social media sites and applications, we may have access to certain information from their social media account such as user name, profile picture, information about friends and followers, and content posted or viewed through the social media sites and applications.  We may use this information to confirm identity, deliver personalized content or as part of the operation of our Site. When visitors use social media networking platforms and plug-ins, they share their information with the third-party social media sites and their use of the information will be subject to that social media site’s privacy practices.</p>
<h4>HOW WE USE, DISCLOSE, AND STORE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
<p class="noMargin">In addition to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, we also use children's information in connection with child-directed activities for our internal purposes, such as to enable them to subscribe to our online newsletter, to enter one of our sweepstakes or contests, to express their opinions on various topics, play games, communicate with their friends, and to offer other products, programs, and services that we believe may be of interest.</p>
<p>We use the information that we collect about others to either enable the child to communicate with them, send them gifts, or in the case of the parent's or guardian's e-mail address, to obtain permission for their child's participation in these activities or to send the parent or guardian notifications about their child's account. When a child provides a parent's or guardian's e-mail address during the registration process, that e-mail address is not stored in a retrievable form in our system. After sending a one-time introductory and/or activation e-mail, if the e-mail is stored, we "hash" or otherwise protect the e-mail address, such as by translating it into a string of letters and numbers that don't identify the Site user and can only be used by the user to, for example, help retrieve forgotten passwords.</p>
<p>We use the website information that we collect to personalize Site visitors’ experience as well as improve the design and content of our Sites. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or features.</p>
<p>We never sell, rent, or otherwise share our visitors' personal information with third parties without appropriate notice and consent, except as set out below. Sometimes, we use agents or contractors to provide services on our behalf to our visitors, such as providing visitors with virtual points they may have purchased, redeeming those points for virtual items or products, sending merchandise visitors have ordered, or helping us administer and fulfill prizes for a contest or sweepstakes. In these cases, we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing.</p>
<p>We, our agents or contractors may disclose information we maintain when required to do so by applicable US or other law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a US or other law enforcement agency's request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Sites and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by US or other law or legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information if we or one of our business units are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.</p>
<h4>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTY SITES AND SPONSORS</h4>
<p class="noMargin">Our Sites may contain links to other Web sites, including those of sponsors and advertisers, whose information practices may be different from ours. Sometimes these third party Web sites might offer content or games, or conduct contests or sweepstakes that are only promoted on our Sites. If visitors are interested in these third party offerings, they should consult those Web sites' privacy notices, since those Web sites are not covered by our Privacy Policy and may follow different procedures.</p>
<h4>COOKIES AND OTHER WEBSITE INFORMATION</h4>
<p class="noMargin">At some pages of our Sites, we may use a software technology called "cookies" or similar technologies to enhance our visitors’ online experience at our Sites and across the Internet. We place cookies on visitors’ computer browsers when they visit our Site so we can store their preferences. We may also use cookies to determine how many times someone visits our Sites and various sections of those Sites.</p>
<p>Some of our Sites may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash cookies") to store visitors’ preferences such as high game score, or provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through a visitor’s web browser, but Flash management tools can be accessed from <a href="http://api.kidswb.com/ui/bumper/interstitial?destination=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macromedia.com%2Fsupport%2Fdocumentation%2Fen%2Fflashplayer%2Fhelp%2Fsettings_manager07.html" target="_blank">Adobe's web site</a>.</p>
<p>We also may use "web beacons." Web beacons (or Web bugs) are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior of and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time for this and other purposes.</p>
<p>For more information about cookies and how browser settings can be changed to reject them, go to your browser's Help menu.  If you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features of our Site.</p>
<h4>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</h4>
<p class="noMargin">We operate globally, so it may be necessary to transfer any information provided to these Sites internationally. In particular, the information provided will likely be transferred to and processed in the United States by us, our agents or contractors. The data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may not be as comprehensive as those in the visitor’s home country. By using this Site, visitors consent to their information being collected and used as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>OUR COMMITMENT TO SECURITY</h4>
<p class="noMargin">We have put in place procedures in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.</p>
<h4>QUESTIONS? CONTACT US</h4>
<p class="noMargin">Parents or guardians with questions or comments regarding this privacy policy or who would like to review or update any personally identifiable information that we have collected online at this Site, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of this information, can contact us at:</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Advanced Digital Services, a division of Warner Bros. Technical Operations Inc.<br>
Attention: Chief Privacy Officer<br>
4000 Warner Blvd., Bldg. 168, Burbank, CA 91522<br>
Telephone: (818) 977-0018<br>
E-mail: <a href="mailto:privacy@wb.com">privacy@wb.com</a></p>
<h4>NOTIFICATION REGARDING UPDATES</h4>
<p class="noMargin">From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. We will notify Site visitors about material changes to our privacy practices by placing a notice on the Site where this Privacy Policy is posted or by sending the parent or guardian an e-mail message. We encourage visitors to periodically check back to review this policy to understand our current privacy practices.</p>
<h4>A FINAL NOTE TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS</h4>
<p class="noMargin">The Internet offers a world of opportunity for children. The additional measures we have taken to help children protect their privacy while online include encouraging children to use non-personally identifiable screen names rather than their real names and taking efforts to prevent children from posting contact information. We encourage parents and guardians to get involved and spend time with their child on the Site. Their guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. Their efforts to instill responsible information practices will help steer their children to age-appropriate sites, and will go a long way toward ensuring that their children have enriching experiences online.</p>
