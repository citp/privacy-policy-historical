       KidsLiveSafe.com is a website owned and operated by Scalable Commerce, LLC ("we"or "us"). We understand how important your privacy is to you, so we are committed to assuring your privacy. This page outlines all of the steps we take to protect your privacy and what we do with your information that you provide to us through our web site.<br>
        <br>
    </address>
    <address>
        <strong>KIDSLIVESAFE.COM PRIVACY PLEDGE:</strong></address>
    <address>
        We do not collect any personal information from you that you do not volunteer, and
        we are the sole owner of all information collected on this site. We fully disclose
        our privacy policy in this document. If you have any questions or comments, you
        are invited to <a href="http://www.kidslivesafe.com/members/contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a>.
    </address>
    <address>
        &nbsp;</address>
    <address>
        <strong>PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION:</strong></address>
    <address>
       We use SSL-encryption technology when transferring and receiving consumer data on our and our affiliates' websites to protect your personal information. We have partnered with VeriSign or other equally reliable encryption services to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. The servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. However, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. We make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your private information.<br>
        <br>
    </address>
    <address>
        &nbsp;</address>
    <address>
        <strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT:</strong></address>
    <address>
        In order to provide you with our services, we collect two types of information about
        our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
    </address>
    <address>
        &nbsp;</address>
    <address>
        <strong>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION: &nbsp;</strong></address>
    <address>
        This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as registering for a membership, ordering or utilizing a product or service, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, assets, liabilities, and other personal identifying information. When ordering products or services on the site, you may be asked to provide a credit or debit card number. Depending upon the product or service, if you do not provide the requested information, you may not be able to obtain the product or service you want. You should be aware that if you enter any personal information during the information request process and then hit the “continue” button on that page, the information you have entered will be transmitted to us, even though you may not complete the process on subsequent pages. Enrollment in any KidsLiveSafe.com service is contingent upon your agreeing to the Terms of Use of membership and providing personally identifiable information as described above.
    </address>
    <address>
        &nbsp;</address>
    <address>
        <strong>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION: </strong>
    </address>
    <address>
        This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.
    </address>
    <address>
        &nbsp;</address>
    <address>
        <strong>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT:</strong></address>
    <address>
       We will use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation of our
        site, fill orders, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically
        analyze site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our site's
        content, layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to
        deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices.
        We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot
        problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our&nbsp;<a href="terms.htm">Terms of Use</a>, <a href="disclaimer.htm">
                Disclaimer</a>, and this Private Policy. Your information may also be used
        by us or by third parties to whom we transfer it to provide the products or services
        you have requested.<br>
        <br>
        When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate
        and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a
        Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that
        can later be retrieved to identify you to us. The cookies make your use of the site
        easier, make the site run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure site. In the event that your browser request that we do not track you or store a cookie, our website is unable to honor such requests.<br>
        <br>
        We may use an outside ad serving company to display banner advertisements on our
        site. As part of their service, they will place a separate cookie on your computer.
        We will not provide any such third-party ad server with your Personally Identifiable
        Information. In addition, other advertisers may also place banner ads on our site,
        and we will not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information to them.<br>
        <br>
        We and our third party ad server may collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable
        Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer
        is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server and whether
        you responded to a particular ad.
     
    </address>
    <address>
        &nbsp;</address>
    <address>
        <strong>WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION:</strong></address>
    <address>
        Other than your credit or debit card information (which we will only share with
        third parties as described below), we may share your Personally Identifiable Information
        with third parties in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and applicable
        state and federal law. We provide the products and services offered on our website
        through contractual arrangements with affiliates, service providers, and other third
        parties. We and such third parties use your Personally Identifiable Information
        to operate our sites and to deliver their products and services.<br>
        <br>
        For example, we must release your credit card or debit card information to the card-issuing
        bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on this site; release
        your Personally Identifiable Information to the third party that will provide the
        products or services that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties
        that help us provide customer service. We will encourage our service providers to
        adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable
        Information by our service providers is governed by the privacy policies of those
        service providers, and is not subject to our control.<br>
        <br>
        We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers'
        sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third party advertisers,
        but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
        <br>
        Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide
        Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities.
        We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order,
        subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate
        with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal
        activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities
        that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.<br>
        <br>
      From time to time we or our marketing partners will send you email newsletters and updates announcing special offers and/or new features as well as materials that are promotional in nature. These email updates may also include offers from our marketing partners that you may be interested in. As part of our service you will receive these updates. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving any of the updates, follow the unsubscribe procedures at the bottom of any newsletter or update we send you.  We reserve the right to rent, sell and share your Personally Identifiable Information with our third-party partners.  Our third-party partners may send you advertisements and special offers that may be of interest to you.

        <strong>PRIVACY POLICY OF THIRD PARTIES:</strong></address>
    <address>
        When you sign-up for services through our site, keep in mind you will be interacting
        with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security policies. Except
        as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses our
        use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other sites accessible through
        our site, and companies to whom your information is transferred, have their own
        privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult
        each site's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices
        of third parties. Additionally, other companies that place advertising on our site
        may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through
        the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of information. You should
        contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of
        the information that they collect. You should also be aware that unsubscribing from
        us will not automatically unsubscribe you from third parties’ lists and/or
        databases. If you wish to opt-out of third party offers, please email us at <a href="mailto:optout@kidslivesafe.com">optout@kidslivesafe.com</a> and we will make commercially reasonable efforts to have your email removed from the list of our 3rd Parties.

    <address>
        <strong>BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS:</strong></address>
    <address>
        As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions,
        customer information (both Personally Identifiable and Non-Personally Identifiable
        Information) may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that
        we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, such customer information
        will be included within the transferred assets.
