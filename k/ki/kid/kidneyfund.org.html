<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, Tahoma">Protecting your personal
privacy is very important to us. We hope the following statement will help you
understand how the American Kidney Fund collects, uses and safeguards the
personal information you might provide to us. Specifics about what information

<br>
Your personal privacy is a principal concern for us. Our goal in outlining our
policy on the collection and use of user data is to ensure the highest level of
confidentiality and security. When you provide any personal information to AKF,
we will not give or sell your personal information to any outside company for
its use in marketing or solicitation. We will maintain the confidentiality of
your personal information and it will be used only to support your relationship
with us, assisting us in providing better services for you. Additionally,
internal practices are in place to help protect your privacy by limiting
employee access to and use of this data. When browsing our site, we allow our
users to maintain control over their personal data while attempting to provide a
more interactive online experience. If you provide a mailing address or e-mail
address, our intention is to send correspondence only to those who have chosen
to receive such communications. At any time, you have the right to decline
receiving future communications in any manner, including e-mail, fax, and postal
mail. <o:p>

directly so that his/her legal rights can be exercised, if appropriate. The only

are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, while
subcontractors may have their work terminated. All individuals with access to
confidential information are expected to report violations -- and may do so
confidentially -- to their managers or other supervisors.</font></p>
