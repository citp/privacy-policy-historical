<p class="title">A Privacy Policy Statement from the American Kidney Fund</p>
<p class="main">Protecting your personal privacy is very important to us. We
  hope the following statement will help you understand how the American Kidney
  Fund collects, uses and safeguards the personal information you might provide
  to us. Specifics about what information is collected and how it is used follows
  this Privacy Policy Statement.</p>
<p class="main"> Your personal privacy is a principal concern for us. Our goal
  in outlining our policy on the collection and use of user data is to ensure
  the highest level of confidentiality and security. When you provide any personal
  information to the Fund, we will not give or sell your personal information
  to any outside company for its use in marketing or solicitation. We will maintain
  the confidentiality of your personal information and it will be used only to
  support your relationship with us, assisting us in providing better services
  for you. Additionally, internal practices are in place to help protect your
  privacy by limiting employee access to and use of this data. When browsing
  our site, we allow our users to maintain control over their personal data while
  attempting to provide a more interactive online experience. If you provide
  a mailing address or e-mail address, our intention is to send correspondence
  only to those who have chosen to receive such communications. At any time,
  you have the right to decline receiving future communications in any manner,
  including e-mail, fax, and postal mail.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Privacy Policies</p>
<ol>
  <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">Information collection.</span> When
    you <strong><em>browse</em></strong> the American Kidney Fund site, you do
    so anonymously. Personal information— including your e-mail address—is <em>not</em> collected.
    However, we may request that you <em><strong>voluntarily</strong></em> supply
    us with personal information, including your E-mail address for purposes
    such as correspondence, site registration, membership, making a purchase
    or donation, or participating in online surveys. We may ask for your name,
    e-mail address, telephone number, mailing address and other optional information
    that we deem necessary to fulfill any requests you may have. At any time,
    you may decline to provide such information and we will do our best to fulfill
    any requests you may have with the information you desire to share with us.<br>
                        <br>
    Like many other web sites, the American Kidney Fund may use a standard technology
    called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is
    used. Please read <a href="cookies.asp"> About Cookies</a> for more information.
    We collect only information that is needed, and we tell you how we use it.
    We limit the collection of information about our site users to what we need
    to know to manage their relationship with the Fund, to provide customer service,
    to offer new products and services, and to fulfill any legal and regulatory
    requirements. We tell our customers about the general uses of information
    we collect about them, and we will provide additional explanation if requested.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">We provide site users with choices
      about how their data will be used.</span> On a regular basis, we provide
      our users the ability to decline any or all future communications. Users
      may also decide if and how they wish to be contacted using other communication
      methods.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">We ensure information quality.</span> We
    use advanced technology and well-defined employee practices to help ensure
    that site user data is processed promptly, accurately and completely.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">We use information security safeguards.</span> Access
    to user data is limited to those who specifically need it to conduct their
    business responsibilities. We use a variety of security techniques designed
    to protect our user information, especially information of a financial nature
    such as donations supporting our work or the use of a credit card to purchase
    items on the web or make a donation to support our work.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">We restrict the release of any
      user information.</span> In addition to providing users with the opportunity
      to refuse communications or offers, we release information only at the
      users' requests. If, for any reason, a court order or subpoena would require
      us to release information, we notify the user directly so that his/her
      legal rights can be exercised, if appropriate. The only exceptions to this
      policy are when we are prohibited by court order or law from notifying
      the user, or cases in which fraud and/or criminal activity is suspected.<br>
  </li>
  <span class="tertiarytitle"><br>
  </span>
  <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">We hold employees and subcontractors
      responsible for our privacy principles.</span> Each Fund employee is personally
      responsible for maintaining user confidentiality and all subcontractors
      are required to enter into an agreement that they will comply with these
      policies. Employees who violate these policies are subject to disciplinary
      action, up to and including dismissal, while subcontractors may have their
      work terminated. All individuals with access to confidential information
      are expected to report violations—and may do so confidentially—to
      their managers or other supervisors.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">Information use.</span> If you
    provide us with your E-mail address or mailing address on this web site,
    we may send you offers or newsletters in the future. These offers or newsletters
    are based on information you provided when you submitted your address, registered
    on a form, or filled out a survey. All communications are carefully designed
    to meet our quality standards—our goal is to provide information that
    will help you as we accomplish our mission of assisting victims of kidney
    disease.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">The data you may provide is used
      to enhance the services and products of the American Kidney Fund.</span> As
      a result of providing any information, the Fund can provide a more customized
      online experience, making your interaction with us more productive, helpful
      and fun.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">Deciding to no longer receive
      any communications.</span> The American Kidney Fund provides users with
      an easy method to decline receiving future e-mail or direct mail offers
      and recognizes the importance of providing you with choices. At any time,
      you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply
      replying to the E-mail address included in every e-mail message you receive
      or by writing to us at the address shown below, on every page our web site,
      or on the direct mail piece.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">Children.</span> The American
    Kidney Fund does not knowingly solicit data from children (defined as anyone
    under 12 years of age), and we will not knowingly mail to or market any services
    to children. Should you discover that your child is on our e-mail or direct
    mail list, simply notify us using the method above and we will immediately
    remove him or her from any future communications.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li class="main"><span class="tertiarytitle">What else should I know about
      my privacy?</span> Third party Internet sites and services that may be
      accessible through the Fund's site have separate privacy and data collection
      practices, independent of us. The Fund has no responsibility or liability
      for these independent policies or actions. You are solely responsible for
      maintaining the secrecy of your passwords, membership ID, or any account
      information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
      If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public,
      you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. While
      we aim to protect your personal information, the Fund cannot ensure or
      warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do
      so at your own risk. </li>

  adhering to these privacy standards, additional restrictions may be imposed
  to comply with state and local laws. For more information, please contact us
