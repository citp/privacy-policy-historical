	  <p><strong><br>
	      WELCOME</strong></p>
	  <p>Kaboose Inc. works hard to provide you with the best services, information and the highest quality interaction on the Internet. We respect the privacy of our users and the concerns of parents for their children visiting our sites.</p>
	  <p>The Internet is a vast resource and we encourage you to become actively involved in your child's online experience and urge you to participate in their development. In keeping with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) we have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to our users' privacy and to explain our information gathering and dissemination practices.</p>
	  <p> If you are interested in reading more about COPPA you can visit the FTC web site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/</a></p>
	  <p><strong> PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</strong></p>
	  <p><strong> What We Collect And How We Use It</strong></p>
	  <p>Anybody can access Kaboose. In particular, children can surf this site, view content and play some games without any personally identifiable information being collected. However, some activities may require that a person provide personally identifiable information. We do not collect more personally identifiable information than necessary to participate in any of the site's activities, and we do not sell or transfer any personally identifiable information collected at this site to third parties without consent.</p>
	  <p> Kaboose does not collect more personally identifiable information from kids under 13 than is necessary for them to participate in our online activities. We urge parents to instruct their children never to give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers when using the Internet.</p>
	  <p> We do not actively solicit, request, or re-use any information from visitors except in the following instances:</p>
	  <p><strong>Requests For Information and Feedback</strong></p>
	  <p>We offer a feedback feature so users can communicate with us. There is a text box for users to write whatever they want to tell us and they are invited to share certain information about themselves although it is not required. If people e-mail us with questions or comments and wish a reply, they need to provide an e-mail address or mailing address. Real names need not be used to request e-mail replies.</p>
	  <p> If a user requests to receive communications from Kaboose (newsletters or company updates, for example) they need to provide a valid e-mail address. Real names need not be used to request newsletters.</p>
	  <p><strong> Contests, Promotions and Electronic Mailing</strong></p>
	  <p>Email addresses that are submitted for entry in a contest or sweepstakes will only be used for the purpose of determining a winner. When entering, children under the age of 13 are required to provide the email address of a parent/guardian. Kaboose will send an email to the parent giving them the option of removing their child from the contest if they so choose. Should a user under the age of 13 be selected as the winner (depending on eligibility and legal requirements per the contest rules and regulations), Kaboose will notify that child that he/she has won and request the parent or guardian complete a release and waiver form so that we may award the prize. Also, if permission is granted by a parent/guardian, we may post the winner's first name, age and home state/province. Once the prize is awarded, only information related to the winner will be maintained for internal administrative purposes.</p>
	  <p> Similarly, if a child wants to receive a newsletter, we will require a parent's email address so that we may notify the parent or guardian of the child's request and allow the parent or guardian the opportunity to rescind that specific request.</p>
	  <p> Parents can request to have their child's information deleted and refuse to permit further collection of information by us. In order to do that, simply contact us.</p>
	  <p><strong> Cards</strong></p>
	  <p>Children can send different types of cards; Emoz, Animated Cards and Zeeks Cards, which are electronic postcards, including a Tell-A-Friend postcards. Children may choose from a variety of pre-approved messages when sending cards, and may send them to anyone they wish. The sender is required to enter a nickname but nothing more. No personal information is collected. The recipient's email address is removed once they have viewed their card.</p>
	  <p><strong> NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong></p>
	  <p><strong>Polls and Surveys</strong></p>
	  <p>From time to time we may ask our site visitors to answer survey questions. Surveys generally deal with the site, our products or categories of products. We may ask for age or age ranges, gender, and other non-personally identifiable information. No personally identifiable information is requested and the information collected from a child is not tied to any personally identifiable information that may have been previously provided. We may have agencies administering our surveys, but these agencies are acting solely on our behalf. We may post sample answers to polls or surveys at the site, no identifying information is ever included. Information gathered from polls and surveys are for internal use by Kaboose, but aggregate information may be shared with others.</p>
