# Privacy Policy | Kidblog

**The Kidblog Inc. Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to the kidblog.org website/application (the “Service”). The Service is owned and operated by Kidblog Inc., a corporation organized under Delaware law (“Kidblog,” “we,” “our”) with offices in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This Privacy Policy applies to all users and visitors of the Service, whether or not they register (“User,” “you,” “your”).

The Service is a blogging platform intended for use by teachers, students, librarians, administrators, parents, and anyone else within an educational setting.

1) Our Commitment to Privacy

This Privacy Policy explains our information practices and defines your options for controlling our use and collection of your information.

Because of technology changes or changes in privacy law, we might make changes to this policy.  If we do, we will notify you via the Service, by email, by means of a notice upon logging in to the Service, or by means of a notice on our homepage of the Service. To make our Privacy Policy easy to find, we have placed a link to it at the bottom the kidblog.org homepage.

2) The Information We Collect

This policy applies to all information collected via the Service plus any information you provide to us by email, by telephone, or in writing.

You provide personal information to us when you register to use the Service and when you request information from us. The personal information we collect from users registering for the Service includes the following:

Your name (teacher and/or school administrator)  
Display Name (this name is displayed to other users)  
Username  
Password  
Email Address  
Class Name (a “class” is a group of users defined by user registering for the Service)  
Credit Card account information (necessary to purchase our Premium Service)

The user registering for the Service can also define the members of a class and grant user access to the Service by issuing usernames and passwords to additional users.

We store all personal information submitted by users for registration purposes, and all blog text and media (images, video, embedded content) posted using the Service. If you submit additional information to us regarding the functionality of the Service or any problems you encounter, we may use this information to improve the performance of the Service, or provide customer service to you and others.

When you post or comment, other users or visitors to the Service may be able to view tis content depending on their viewing privileges. Users who register for the Service can assign viewing and usage privileges to other users.

WE URGE USERS TO EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN POSTING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE OR OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THE SERVICE. REMEMBER, ANY INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN THESE AREAS MAY BECOME PUBLIC INFORMATION THROUGH THE ACTIONS OF ANY USER HAVING VIEWING PRIVILEGES.

In addition to the personal information you supply, we may automatically collect non-personal information to evaluate how the Service is used. We collect non-personal data to make the Service work better for users in the following ways: to improve the Service design, layout, and appearance; to provide personalization of the Service for users; and to evaluate the performance of any communication related to the Service. The technologies we use to gather this non-personal information may include IP addresses, web browser cookies, clear gifs, browser detection, and blog metadata.

3) How We Use Information

We collect personally identifiable information from registered users so that they may have secure access to the Service. Users are responsible for safeguarding their own usernames, passwords, and email addresses. If your registration or account information has been breached, you can contact us for assistance.

Our primary goal for collecting non-personal user information is to improve the performance and design of the Service.

We will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as set forth below.

We may use your email address to answer email we receive from you and to provide status updates for the Service.

From time to time, you may be invited to participate in optional customer surveys or contests, and Kidblog may request that you provide some or all of the above listed personally identifiable information in those surveys or contests. We use information collected through contests to contact winners and award prizes. We also use information collected from surveys to learn about our customers in order to improve our services and develop new products and services of interest to our customers.

Kidblog uses “IP addresses”, “cookies”, “clear gifs”, browser detection, and blog metadata to provide a better experience on this Service and to collect useful business information. Third party technologies such as cookies may also be used for the same purposes.

IP addresses define the Internet location of computers and help us better understand the geographic distribution of our users and manage the performance of this Service. Cookies are files placed onto the file storage system of your computer when you visit the Service so the Service will automatically recognize you each time visit the Service and deliver content specific to you. You may modify your browser preferences to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies. Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your choices about cookies. If you modify your browser to reject certain or all cookies, you may not be able to use certain features of the Service.

We also use a technology called “clear gifs”. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers that are used to track emails and online movements, helping us understand what communication campaigns and content are effective.

We detect the type of web browser you are using to optimize the performance of the Service based on the browser preferences of our users and visitors. To learn about how people use our Service we also examine blog metadata, which show the paths people take through our site and how much time they spend in certain areas.

Kidblog may contract with unaffiliated third parties to provide services for the Service, such as website and data hosting, software for Service features, customer communications, analyzing and evaluating the information we collect, and other services. When we do this, we may provide your personally identifiable information to third parties solely for purpose of providing those services; all such third parties are prohibited by contract from using such information for any other purpose.

TO THE EXTENT THAT THE INFORMATION THAT KIDBLOG COLLECTS AS PART OF THE SERVICE INCLUDES PERSONAL INFORMATION REGARDING STUDENT USERS, THE TEACHER, SCHOOL, OR SCHOOL DISTRICT RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH STUDENT’S USE OF THE SERVICE MAY REQUEST AT ANY TIME THAT KIDBLOG DELETE ALL SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION BY SENDING AN EMAIL TO PRIVACY@KIDBLOG.ORG.

4) Our Commitment to Data Security

Access to your personally identifiable information and all data you store on the Service is limited to authorized Kidblog staff and authorized service providers, and is restricted by password protection mechanisms. Kidblog protects data by encrypting web Service traffic via modern TLS (“https”) protocols, and by employing firewall technologies to prevent unauthorized access to our servers.

In the event of an unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information, Kidblog shall promptly notify you of such disclosure as required by applicable state and/or federal law.

5) Use of Kidblog by Children
