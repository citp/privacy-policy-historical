Privacy Policy

A Privacy Policy Statement from the American Kidney Fund

Protecting your personal privacy is very important to us. We hope the following statement will help you understand how the American Kidney Fund collects, uses and safeguards the personal information you might provide to us. Specifics about what information is collected and how it is used follows this Privacy Policy Statement.

Your personal privacy is a principal concern for us. Our goal in outlining our policy on the collection and use of user data is to ensure the highest level of confidentiality and security. When you provide any personal information to the Fund, we will not give or sell your personal information to any outside company for its use in marketing or solicitation. We will maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and it will be used only to support your relationship with us, assisting us in providing better services for you. Additionally, internal practices are in place to help protect your privacy by limiting employee access to and use of this data. When browsing our site, we allow our users to maintain control over their personal data while attempting to provide a more interactive online experience. If you provide a mailing address or e-mail address, our intention is to send correspondence only to those who have chosen to receive such communications. At any time, you have the right to decline receiving future communications in any manner, including e-mail, fax, and postal mail.

Privacy Policies

  1. Information collection. When you **_browse_** the American Kidney Fund site, you do so anonymously. Personal information— including your e-mail address—is _not_ collected. However, we may request that you _**voluntarily**_ supply us with personal information, including your E-mail address for purposes such as correspondence, site registration, membership, making a purchase or donation, or participating in online surveys. We may ask for your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mailing address and other optional information that we deem necessary to fulfill any requests you may have. At any time, you may decline to provide such information and we will do our best to fulfill any requests you may have with the information you desire to share with us.

Like many other web sites, the American Kidney Fund may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. Please read [ About Cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20060618103728id_/http%3A//www.kidneyfund.org/cookies.asp) for more information. We collect only information that is needed, and we tell you how we use it. We limit the collection of information about our site users to what we need to know to manage their relationship with the Fund, to provide customer service, to offer new products and services, and to fulfill any legal and regulatory requirements. We tell our customers about the general uses of information we collect about them, and we will provide additional explanation if requested.

  

  2. We provide site users with choices about how their data will be used. On a regular basis, we provide our users the ability to decline any or all future communications. Users may also decide if and how they wish to be contacted using other communication methods.  

  

  3. We ensure information quality. We use advanced technology and well-defined employee practices to help ensure that site user data is processed promptly, accurately and completely.  

  

  4. We use information security safeguards. Access to user data is limited to those who specifically need it to conduct their business responsibilities. We use a variety of security techniques designed to protect our user information, especially information of a financial nature such as donations supporting our work or the use of a credit card to purchase items on the web or make a donation to support our work.  

  

  5. We restrict the release of any user information. In addition to providing users with the opportunity to refuse communications or offers, we release information only at the users' requests. If, for any reason, a court order or subpoena would require us to release information, we notify the user directly so that his/her legal rights can be exercised, if appropriate. The only exceptions to this policy are when we are prohibited by court order or law from notifying the user, or cases in which fraud and/or criminal activity is suspected.  

  

  6. We hold employees and subcontractors responsible for our privacy principles. Each Fund employee is personally responsible for maintaining user confidentiality and all subcontractors are required to enter into an agreement that they will comply with these policies. Employees who violate these policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, while subcontractors may have their work terminated. All individuals with access to confidential information are expected to report violations—and may do so confidentially—to their managers or other supervisors.  

  

  7. Information use. If you provide us with your E-mail address or mailing address on this web site, we may send you offers or newsletters in the future. These offers or newsletters are based on information you provided when you submitted your address, registered on a form, or filled out a survey. All communications are carefully designed to meet our quality standards—our goal is to provide information that will help you as we accomplish our mission of assisting victims of kidney disease.  

  

  8. The data you may provide is used to enhance the services and products of the American Kidney Fund. As a result of providing any information, the Fund can provide a more customized online experience, making your interaction with us more productive, helpful and fun.  

  

  9. Deciding to no longer receive any communications. The American Kidney Fund provides users with an easy method to decline receiving future e-mail or direct mail offers and recognizes the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply replying to the E-mail address included in every e-mail message you receive or by writing to us at the address shown below, on every page our web site, or on the direct mail piece.  

  

  10. Children. The American Kidney Fund does not knowingly solicit data from children (defined as anyone under 12 years of age), and we will not knowingly mail to or market any services to children. Should you discover that your child is on our e-mail or direct mail list, simply notify us using the method above and we will immediately remove him or her from any future communications.  

  

  11. What else should I know about my privacy? Third party Internet sites and services that may be accessible through the Fund's site have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. The Fund has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords, membership ID, or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. While we aim to protect your personal information, the Fund cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 



While the American Kidney Fund puts forth its best efforts in adhering to these privacy standards, additional restrictions may be imposed to comply with state and local laws. For more information, please contact us at:
