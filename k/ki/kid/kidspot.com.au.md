This company may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visit to this Website in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

## How does Kidspot Australia protect kids' privacy?

Kidspot Australia is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet and will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. top

## What are cookies? How does Kidspot Australia use cookies on its site?

A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites you've visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie. 

We use cookies in order to improve your search and advertising experience. Cookies enable us to keep track of your search preferences and advertising selections as you use our site. 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order to enable you to purchase advertising from our site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered advertiser, which allows you to access your account information. top

## Is my information secure?

Protecting your advertising order information is important to us. Kidspot Australia uses SecurePay's Internet Payment Gateway to provide a secure environment for the authorisation of credit card transactions over the Internet. Confidential information including client credit card details are encrypted the moment they are transmitted from the client's browser to the banking network using industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology )128-bit RC4 encryption technology.

A client's credit card details are not stored anywhere on the Internet and the only company who has access to this data is the merchant's bank. The bank also sends confirmation information via the same encryption technology back to the client's browser. These secure processes provide clients with peace of mind when purchasing online.

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at Kidspot. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."

If your browser or firewall doesn't support SSL, you will not be able to connect to the server, which means you won't be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please place your order by phone at 1-300-724-575.top

## What about links to other websites and services?

The Kidspot Australia website and its advertisements may contain links to other sites. Kidspot does not control the privacy policies or practices of these websites. You should review those policies before providing any personal information. Kidspot is not responsible for the content or practices of any linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.top
