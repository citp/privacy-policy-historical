<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<div class="minimal-padding">
  <p>Kidzworld is a <a href="/corporate/safety" title="the safest website for children">safe website for kids</a>. We have developed this policy statement to reflect our <b><i>commitment to kids safety, security and privacy</i></b>. The kids on Kidzworld have access to the <a href="safety"><b><i>safest kids website</i></b></a>; however, we do try to educate them to be aware of what they are doing and to take steps to ensure their own safety.</p> 
  
    <h2>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
    Kidzworld is a leading <a href="safety"><b><i>safe website for kids</i></b></a>. It was established in 1999, by Allen W. Achilles as a direct result of his concern for the safety and security of his own children online. Since that time, Allen Achilles has been an advocate for the safety and security of kids online is protected. COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) became effective on April 21, 2000. The regulations apply to the online collection of personal information from children 12 years and younger. The Act spells out what website operators, need to include in privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent and what responsibilities website operators, have to protect and secure children’s privacy and safety online. Kidzworld is a <b><i>safe website for kids</i></b> and respects the privacy of it users, who are kids. <p>COPPA applies to individual identifiable information about a child (12 or younger) that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact a kid. The Act also applies to other types of information, such as hobbies, interests and user information gathered through the use of cookies and other methods of tracking, when they are tied to individually identifiable information.</p> <p>Kidzworld and founder Allen Achilles are tireless advocates of <b><i>Internet privacy</i></b>.   As the only <b><i>fully moderated website for kids</i></b>, we take extraordinary measures to ensure and secure the <b><i>privacy and safety of our kids</i></b>.</p>
  
    <h2>Kidzworld User Registration and Membership</h2>
    <p>Our registration form requires kids to provide us with contact information: first name, last initial, email address and demographic information (age, gender, state/province). This information is used to get in touch with users if necessary. For kids 12 and under we collect only their birthdate, location, gender and parent/guardians email address. We send the parent/guardian a confirmation email to which they must respond in order to activate the childs' account. The parents email address is retained in our database for future contact.</p> <p>We do not disclose the kids personal information to anyone, at any time, for any reason. Parents or guardians can review their kid's personal information once we receive verifiable identification. Verifiable consent can be given by one of the following methods:   following the link provided in the confirmation email, provide a signed form  via postal mail or facsimile or even giving us a call. Upon request, parents may delete or prohibit the further collection of their child's personal information by contacting us at <strong>privacy@kidzworld.com</strong> and clearly stating the nature of their inquiry. Any contact made with our member kids is done so through the facilities of Kidzworld.</p> <p>Another way that Kidzworld accesses information about kids is through IP addresses. An IP address is something that is unique to your computer, and is used to identify and collect broad demographic information (like age, gender, regional information and generic interests).  As a <b><i>safe website for kids</i></b>, tools such as these can be used positively and in the sole interest of protecting the <b><i>privacy and safety of all kids online</i></b>.</p> <p>Kidzworld also uses a form for kids to request information, products and services. We collect kids unique identifiers (like their Kidzworld on-screen name) to fulfill these requests.</p> <p>Kidzworld hosts regular contests in which we ask kids for contact information (like their e-mail address). This information is soley used to contact winners.  Contact information collected for contests is deleted once winners have been confirmed. Participation in contests is open to all kids, registered or not.</p>
  
    <h2>The KW Zone - Social Networking at Kidzworld</h2>
    <p>The KW Zone is a unique component of the Kidzworld experience. In The KW Zone kids can create an online profile where they can design backgrounds, upload pictures and videos, make friends and interact with other kids with similar interests. All content site wide is strictly <b><i>moderated</i></b>, but kids are still cautioned that anything they upload (and are subsequently approved) can be viewable across the web.  We recommended that the kids only upload images and information that they are willing to share with other kids.</p>
  
    <h2>Chat Rooms and Bulletin Boards</h2>
    <p>Kidzworld has <b><i>safe, moderated chat rooms, bulletin boards, discussion groups and forums</i></b>. These are only accessible by our registered users. We make our users aware that postings and conversations in these areas becomes public information. Kids are not allowed to disclose any personally identifiable information. The kidzworld username is their only identity at Kidzworld, and that is how people should know you on the Internet.</p> <p>Kidzworld’s <b><i>safe and secure chat room and bulletin boards are moderated at all times</i></b> by experienced Kidzworld staff.  Our chatroom is open from 11am to 7:00pm Pacific Time (PST). Our chat moderators take extraordinary steps to ensure that the kids do not divulge personal information. Kids who tries to reveal, or ask for, personal information will be removed from both the chat and message boards for 24 hours. If problems continue with the same kid, their IP address could be permanently blocked and future access denied to the website from that IP address.</p>
  
    <h2>E-cards</h2>
    <p>Kidzworld offers numerous public domain <b><i>e-cards</i></b> for kids to send to family and friends. To send an e-card, kids must know the email address of the person that they are sending to. Thus, it can readily be assumed that they already know this person in real life. They must, by law also include their own email address and their name. Failure to do so will result in the e-card being treated as spam.  Information entered in the e-card is used solely for the purpose of sending the e-card.  It is not stored or retained by Kidzworld.</p>
