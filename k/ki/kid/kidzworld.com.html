<h1 class="text_h1 text_wide">Privacy</h1>
<p>Kidzworld is a leading safe website for kids. We have developed this policy statement to reflect our commitment to kids safety, security and privacy. The kids on Kidzworld have access to the safest kids website, however, we do try to educate them to be aware of what they are doing and to take steps to ensure their own safety.</p>
<h2 class="text_h2 text_wide">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
<p>Kidzworld is a the leading safe website for kids. It was established in 1999, by Allen W. Achilles as a direct result of his concern for the safety and security of his own children online. Since that time. Allen Achilles has been a leader in ensuring the safety and security of kids online is protected. COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) became effective on April 21, 2000. The regulations apply to the online collection of personal information from children 12 years and younger. The Act spells out what website operators, need to include in privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent and what responsibilities website operators, have to protect and secure children’s privacy and safety online. Kidzworld is the leading safe website for kids and respects the privacy of it users, who are kids.</p>
<p>COPPA applies to individual identifiable information about a child (12 or younger) that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact a kid. The Act also applies to other types of information, such as hobbies, interests and user information gathered through the use of cookies and other methods of tracking, when they are tied to individually identifiable information.</p>
<p>Kidzworld and founder Allen Achilles are tireless advocates of Internet privacy.   As the only fully moderated website for kids, we take extraordinary measures to ensure and secure the privacy and safety of our kids.</p>
<h2 class="text_h2 text_wide">Kidzworld User Registration and Membership</h2>
<p>Our registration form requires kids to provide us with contact information: name, email address and demographic information (age, gender, state/province). This information is used to get in touch with our members kids if necessary. For kids over 13 years old, we send their parent/guardian an email notifying them that they have registered at Kidzworld and provided us with personally identifiable information. For kids 12 and under we obtain permission from the kids parent/guardian before the registration is completed. We send them a confirmation email to which they must respond.</p>
<p>We do not disclose the kids personal information to anyone, at any time, for any reason. Parents or guardians can review their kid's personal information once we receive verifiable identification. Verifiable consent can be given by one of the following methods:   following the link provided in the confirmation email, provide a signed form  via postal mail or facsimile or even giving us a call. Upon request, parents may delete or prohibit the further collection of their child's personal information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kidzworld.com">privacy@kidzworld.com</a> and clearly state the nature of their inquiry. Any contact made with our member kids is done so through the facilities of Kidzworld.</p>
<p>Another way that Kidzworld accesses information about kids is through IP addresses. An IP address is something that is unique to your computer, and is used to identify and collect broad demographic information (like age, gender, regional information and generic interests).  As a safe website for kids, tools such as these can be used positively and in the sole interest of protecting the privacy and safety of all kids online.</p>
<p>Kidzworld also uses a form for kids to request information, products and services. We collect kids unique identifiers (like their Kidzworld on-screen name) to fulfill these requests.</p>
<p>Kidzworld hosts regular contests in which we ask kids for contact information (like their e-mail address). This information is soley used to contact winners.  Contact information collected for contests is deleted once winners have been confirmed. Participation in contests is open to all kids, registered or not.</p>
<h2 class="text_h2 text_wide">The KW Zone - Social Networking at Kidzworld</h2>
<p>The KW Zone is the latest, and most exciting, component of the Kidzworld experience. The KW Zone allows users to create their own online profile where they can design backgrounds, upload pictures and videos, make friends and interact with other members with similar interests. All content on profile pages is strictly monitored, but members are still cautioned that anything they upload (and is subsequently approved) will then be viewable across the world wide web. We recommended that you only upload things that you are willing to share with everyone.</p> 
<h2 class="text_h2 text_wide">Chat Rooms and Bulletin Boards</h2>
<p>Kidzworld has safe, moderated chat rooms, bulletin boards, discussion groups and forums. These are only accessible by our registered users. We make the kids aware that postings and conversations in these areas becomes public information. Kids are not allowed to disclose any personally identifiable information. The kidzworld username is their only identity at Kidzworld, and that is how people should know you on the Internet.</p>
<p>Kidzworld’s safe and secure chatroom and bulletin boards are moderated at all times by experienced Kidzworld staff.  Our chatroom is open from 11am to 7:00pm Pacific Time (PST). Our chat moderators take extraordinary steps to ensure that the kids do not divulge personal information. Kids who tries to reveal, or ask for, personal information will be removed from both the chat and message boards for 24 hours. If problems continue with the same kid, their IP address could be permanently blocked and future access denied to the website from that IP address.</p>
<h2 class="text_h2 text_wide">E-cards</h2>
<p>Kidzworld offers numerous public domain e-cards for kids to send to family and friends. To send an e-card, kids must know the email address of the person that they are sending to. Thus, it can readily be assumed that they already know this person in real life. They must also include their own email addres and their name. Failure to do so would result in the email being treated as spam.  Information entered in the e-card is used solely for the purpose of sending the e-card.  It is not stored or retained by Kidzworld.</p>
<h2 class="text_h2 text_wide">Outbound Links</h2>
<p>Our site contains links to other sites. Although Kidzworld is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other sites, we screen all sites accessible from Kidzworld, as a safe website for kids, to ensure that they comply with our standards. When a kid clicks on an outbound link, they are first directed to a page informing them that they are about to leave Kidzworld.</p>
<h2 class="text_h2 text_wide">Email communications</h2>
<p>Occasionally Kidzworld may communicate with the kids by email. Kidzworld allows kids to opt-out of receiving communications from us in the registration form. If a user wishes to opt-out after completing the registration form, they can do so by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kidzworld.com">privacy@kidzworld.com</a> or by clicking on the Unsubscribe link in the next newsletter. </p>
