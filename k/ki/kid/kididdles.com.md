**Collected Information**  
For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only a consumer's IP address. Our Web server does **not** automatically recognize or collect a consumer's Email address.

**KIDiddles does not send out unsolicited Email.** We collect the Email addresses of those who submit an order online, send inquiries to us by Email, enter any of our contests, and/or subscribe to any of our mailing lists or newsletters. We will only communicate with you by Email as follows:

  * For customers to our online store, to provide you with an update on the status of your order, or to request additional information before proceeding with your order, if required; or
  * To reply to your inquiry (if a response is required).



We also collect aggregate, non-identifying information on what pages our visitors access or visit.

We do not send out 'junkmail.' If you supply us with your postal address, it will only be used for the purpose of completing your order, or sending other information as requested by you.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers online will only be contacted by us by phone with respect to their inquiry (if phone contact has been requested), or with respect to orders they have placed online. **This is generally only necessary if there is a problem with your order.**

The information we collect is **not** sold, leased, or otherwise shared with any other organizations except for:

  * For customers to our online store, for communications with the financial institution that issued your credit card, if a manual name or address verification is required, or to report a potentially fraudulent credit card transaction; and/or
  * Communications with our bank if a credit card charge has been disputed.



**Cookies**  
We use cookies only in our online store. In that case, they are to retain visitors' preferences, record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

**Ad Servers**  
We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies. We do run our own banner ad program, for which all advertisers are screened before their ads are displayed. The advertisers of those banner ads have access to information regarding the number of times their ads have been displayed and clicked, as well as the IP addresses of visitors who viewed their ads, but they do **not** receive **any** identifying information whatsoever about our visitors.

**Other Uses**  
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will use for these new purposes only data collected **from the time of the policy change forward.**

**Security**  
We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site.

 **Non-Compliance**  
If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at the above address, via our [Contact Us](http://www.kididdles.com/about2/contact.html) page, or through your state or local consumer protection office.
