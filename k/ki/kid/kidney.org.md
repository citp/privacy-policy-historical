## Information Collected Online and Elsewhere

When you apply for membership, donate funds or a vehicle, register for an event, or sign up for a newsletter, we may ask for basic information that may include name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number and e-mail address. The National Kidney Foundation will not sell, trade or share your personal information with anyone else, nor will we send mailings to you on behalf of other organizations. Online payment information, i.e. credit card numbers, is **not** stored. Should you voluntarily disclose personal information online, e.g. on message boards, through e-mail or in chat areas, that information may be collected and used by others.

## Online Transactions

National Kidney Foundation Web sites employ Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security for data encryption and firewall technology. System passwords are routinely changed. All credit card information transmitted during online transactions is processed with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security, an established protocol for transmitting information via the Internet which uses server authentication and data encryption to ensure that your data is safe and secure. Once processed, credit card information is not stored. Access to National Kidney Foundation Web sites is restricted to authorized staff only. Despite use of these safeguards, we cannot guarantee and do not represent that your information will always be secure from unauthorized access.

## Web Site Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a Web site and is stored on your computer's hard drive. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but to protect your privacy your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

## How NKF Uses Cookies

The National Kidney Foundation uses cookies to remember visitor preferences. For example, when a visitor changes the text style on our Web site using our [style changer](http://www.kidney.org/about/stylechange.cfm), the selection is stored in a cookie so that it will be applied upon each visit. We also provide the ability to store login information for certain areas of our site including our forums. NKF does not use cookies to store or transmit personal information.
