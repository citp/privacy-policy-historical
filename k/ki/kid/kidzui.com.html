                  <h2>KidZui Children's Privacy Policy</h2>
                  <h3>Types of Information Collected by KidZui</h3>
                  <p>Information gathered by KidZui - Children can visit the KidZui.com site without any personally identifiable information being collected from them. However, if they download and use the KidZui browser, some personally identifiable information must be collected from children, but no personally identifiable information is collected by the application until you provide your consent, as set forth below.</p>
                  <p>At registration, KidZui collects a screen name, gender, date of birth and first name from your child, as well as a parent or guardian’s email address. KidZui also gathers usage data regarding your child’s Internet activity via the KidZui browser, including what web pages they visit or share, what pictures and videos they view or share, searches (and results of such searches), content they rate, tag and select as their favorites, as well as time spent online including time online, number of sessions per day, date, etc. KidZui believes in not collecting more personally identifiable information from children than is necessary to use its services. In addition, users should be aware that sites that are targeted to children 12 or under are prohibited by law from collecting more information than they need.</p>
                  <p>
                    As a parent, you may request at any time that the information collected about your child be removed from the KidZui database. In addition, the service itself permits you to monitor and review information regarding your child, including your child’s Internet activity, what web pages they visit, what pictures and videos they view, rate or share, as well as time spent online, searches and search results, their friends and categories visited. If you are a parent and wish to deactivate your KidZui account, please send an email message to
                    <a href="mailto:support@kidzui.com">support@kidzui.com</a>
                    from your registered email account, requesting that the account be cancelled. When we receive your cancellation request, we will permanently delete all information associated with your account.
                  </p>
                  <p>Use and disclosure of children’s personally identifiable information – No personally identifiable information from users 12 or under is used for any promotional or marketing purposes whatsoever inside or outside KidZui.com. We ask for your child’s date of birth to validate their age. We track what all children of the same age look at and enjoy online to tailor and improve our services, without sharing personally-identifiable information about any individual child. We do not share personally identifiable information from users 12 or under with any third party. However, when your child visits other websites using the KidZui browser, their information may be collected by third parties in the manner identified on those websites, and their practices may be different from ours. You should review these websites’ privacy policies to ensure you are aware of their privacy practices because KidZui.com is not responsible for these websites’ information practices.</p>
                  <p>Notification to parents - At the time a child 12 or under registers with KidZui.com and downloads the KidZui browser, an email is sent to the child’s parent or guardian. We require parents to give express permission before we will permit their child to use any feature on KidZui.com where personally identifiable information can be made public to the Internet and shared with other users.</p>
                  <p>You can refuse any registrations that your children make in order to use any feature on KidZui.com and the KidZui browser where personally identifiable information can be made public to the Internet and shared with other users. If KidZui does not hear back from you, we will assume you have not consented to your child being registered with us and we will delete all information we have received from your child, within a reasonable time. Once a child is registered, he or she will be permitted to use any future registration-based features and parents are not notified again. In these circumstances, we use the information collected only to permit children to use the functions of KidZui.com and the KidZui browser, and not for any other purpose.</p>
                  <p>Security - KidZui understands the importance of protecting the personally identifiable information associated with our users. KidZui  takes a variety of security steps to protect all users’ information, including administrative, technical and contractual steps. When credit card information is provided we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it. Users should also take steps to protect their security including never giving out their password. Parents should never provide their parent login password to their child.</p>
                  <p>Parent access to information - Parents can review information that has been collected about children who are 12 or under in the following 2 methods:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Parents can review their child’s personally identifiable information by logging into the parental account that is created once the registration is approved by going to http://www.KidZui.com. You will need to have your e-mail address that you used to sign-up and the password you selected at sign-up.</li>
                    <li>
                      You can also contact KidZui Customer Support to view the information that has been collected from or about your child by sending an email to
                      <a href="mailto:support@kidzui.com">support@kidzui.com.</a>
                      You will need to have your parent login information (e-mail address) as well as your child’s user name and password to enable us to answer your questions.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
