    <b>Terms and Conditions / Privacy Policy </b>
    <p>Search results provided by Google SafeSearch with additional keyword 
	filtering by KidzSearch.com. KidzSearch offers no guarantees or warranties on results. 
	Please <a href="contactus.html">contact us</a> if you have any specific 
	issues or concerns about results found.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>KidzSearch believes that maintaining the online privacy of children is 
    essential to building a safe site where kids can learn and play. We provide 
    the following information about our policies in conformance with the 1998 
    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>
    <p><b>1. What personal information does KidzSearch collect?</b></p>
    <p>KidzSearch does not collect visitors' personally identifiable 
    information without consent, nor does KidzSearch require visitors to give personally 
    identifiable information in order to access or use our site. KidzSearch will 
    not require a visitor to disclose more information than is reasonably 
    necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of that 
    participation. The KidzSearch site contains links to other Web sites that 
    may ask for personal information. Although we try to review such sites 
    carefully, KidzSearch expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for 
    the privacy policies, data collection practices or regulatory compliance of 
    those independent sites. KidzSearch may have offers for a subscription 
    newsletter. Visitors must voluntarily enter their email in order to receive 
    our newsletter. We do not sell email names or provide access to 
    third-parties.&nbsp; Personal information, such as names, phone numbers, or 
    address details are never collected.</p>
    <p><b>2. Does KidzSearch use cookies?</b></p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p><b>3. Does KidzSearch collect aggregated information?</b></p>
    <p>KidzSearch collects statistics on which keywords a visitor searches and 
    which responses they select. This information is gathered together 
    (aggregated) so that individual visitors cannot be identified or 
    distinguished from the whole. For example, we might know that 100 visitors 
    searched for giraffes, but we do not know who those visitors were. This 
    information helps us make editorial and design decisions to make KidzSearch 
    more helpful and even easier to use. In addition, we may use this 
    information to help us target advertising or content for the site in 
    general. We also may collect IP Addresses (which domain a visitor is logged 
    on from), Referral Data (the address of the last URL a user visited prior to 
    clicking through to KidzSearch), Browser type (which browser is being used), 
    Platform Type (whether a visitor uses Macintosh or Windows), and Traffic 
    Flow (where a visitor spends their time while on the site) on our site, 
    however these collected pieces of information do not allow for personal 
    identification of the visitor.</p>
    <p><b>4. Does KidzSearch have a chat room?</b></p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p><b>5. Does KidzSearch run contests for children?</b></p>
    <p>We may have periodic contests.&nbsp; Collected information is never given 
    out to third-parties.</p>
    <p><b>6. How can I contact KidzSearch if I have questions about this Privacy 
    Policy?</b></p>
    <p>If you have any questions about the KidzSearch Privacy Policy, 
	<a href="contactus.html">email us</a>.<br>
	&nbsp;</p></font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM TERMS</b><br>
	KidzSearch may offer partnership programs, such as
	<a href="giveback/index.html">school funding</a>, site customization for 
	your school, and other business relations.&nbsp; These agreements will begin 
	upon our acceptance of your application and will end when terminated by 
	either party. Termination may happen at any time, with or without cause, by 
	giving the other party written notice of termination.<br>
