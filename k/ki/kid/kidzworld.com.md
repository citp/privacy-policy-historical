# Privacy Policy | Safe Website For kids - Kidzworld

Established in 2001, Kidzworld is the **_first[safe](http://safe.kidzworld.com/) social network for kids_**. We have developed this policy statement to reflect our **commitment to[kids safety](http://safe.kidzworld.com/), security and privacy**. [Kidzworld](http://www.kidzworld.com/) users have access to the **[safest kids social network](https://web.archive.org/kwzone)** ; however, we do try to educate them to be aware of what they are doing everywhere online and to take the appropriate steps to ensure their **online safety**. 

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

Kidzworld is a leading [**_safe website for kids_**](https://web.archive.org/web/20120617044358id_/http%3A//www.kidzworld.com/corporate/safety). It was established in 2001, by Allen W. Achilles as a direct result of his concern for the safety and security of his own children online. Since that time, Allen Achilles has been a tireless advocate for the safety and security of kids online. COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) became effective on April 21, 2000. The regulations apply to the online collection of personal information from children 12 years and younger. The Act spells out what website operators, need to include in privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent and what responsibilities website operators, have to protect and secure children’s privacy and safety online.

COPPA applies to individual identifiable information about a child (12 or younger) that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact a kid. The Act also applies to other types of information, such as hobbies, interests and user information gathered through the use of cookies and other methods of tracking, when they are tied to individually identifiable information. 

Kidzworld and founder Allen Achilles are tireless advocates of **_internet safety and privacy_**. As the only **_[fully moderated kids social network](https://web.archive.org/kwzone)_** , we take extraordinary measures to ensure and secure the **_privacy and safety of our kids_**. 

## Kidzworld User Registration and Membership

Our registration form requires users to provide us with contact information: first name, last initial, email address, age, gender, and country, state/province. The email address is only used to contact users if necessary. For users 12 and under we only collect their birthdate, location, gender and parent/guardians email address. We send the parent/guardian a confirmation email to which they must respond in order to activate the childs' account. Parent email address is retained in our database for future contact. Under no circumstances do we market products or offerings to our users by email. 

We do not disclose users personal information to anyone, at any time except by subpoena from authorities. However, in the event of the sale or merger of the company; Kidzworld.com, Inc., the personal information collected by Kidzworld about its user in the normal course of its business will be shared with the partner company or successor company upon completion of the subject acquisition or merger. Parents or guardians can review their childs personal information once we receive verifiable identification. Verifiable consent can be given by one of the following methods: following the link provided in the confirmation email, provide a signed form via postal mail or facsimile or even giving us a call. Upon request, parents may delete or prohibit the further collection of their child's personal information by contacting us at privacy@kidzworld.com.

Another way that Kidzworld accesses information about kids is through IP addresses. An IP address is unique to the users computer, and is used to identify and collect broad demographic information (like age, gender, regional information and generic interests). As a **_[safe social network for kids](https://web.archive.org/kwzone)_** , tools such as these can be used positively and in the sole interest of protecting the **_privacy and safety of all kids online_**.

Kidzworld also employs a HELP form for kids to request information, products and services. We collect kids unique identifiers ( their Kidzworld on-screen name) to fulfill these requests, however, the information is not retained.

Kidzworld hosts regular contests in which we ask kids for contact information (like their e-mail address). This information is soley used to contact winners. Contact information collected for contests is deleted once winners have been confirmed. Participation in contests is open to all kids, registered or not.

## The KW Zone - Safe Social Networking at Kidzworld

In The KW Zone kids can create an online profile where they can design backgrounds, upload pictures and videos, make friends and interact with other kids with similar interests. All direct user interaction is **fully moderated** , by not only our sophisticated computer technology but also by real live people. Users are still cautioned that anything they upload (and is subsequently approved) may be viewable across the web. We recommended that the kids only upload images and information that they are willing to share with others. 

## Chat Rooms and Bulletin Boards

Kidzworld has **_safe, moderated chat rooms, bulletin boards, discussion groups and forums_**. These are only accessible by our registered users. We make our users aware that postings and conversations in these areas becomes public information. Kids are not allowed to disclose any personally identifiable information. Their anonymous kidzworld username is their only identity at Kidzworld, and is how users are known on the site.

Kidzworld’s **_safe and secure chat room and bulletin boards are moderated at all times_** by experienced Kidzworld staff. Our chatroom is open from 11am to 7:00pm Pacific Time (PST) Monday through Thursday and 9:00am to 8:00pm Fri through Sun. Our chat moderators take extraordinary steps to ensure that the kids do not divulge personal information. Kids who tries to reveal, or ask for, personal information will be removed from both the chat and message boards for a period of time. If problems continue with the same user, their IP address may be permanently blocked and future access denied to the website from that IP address.

## E-cards

Kidzworld offers numerous public domain **_e-cards_** for kids to send to family and friends. To send an e-card, kids must know the email address of the person that they are sending to. Thus, it can readily be assumed that they already know this person in real life. They must, by law also include their own email address and their name. Failure to do so will result in the e-card being treated as spam. Information entered in the e-card is used solely for the purpose of sending the e-card. It is not stored or retained by Kidzworld.

## Outbound Links

Although Kidzworld is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other sites, we screen all sites accessible from Kidzworld, as a **[safe website for kids](http://safe.kidzworld.com/)** , to ensure that they comply with our standards. When a kid clicks on an outbound link, they are first directed to a page informing them that they are about to leave Kidzworld.
