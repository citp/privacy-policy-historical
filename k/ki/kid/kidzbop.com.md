When you CONTACT US by phone, email or otherwise to submit information to us (such as when contacting us with a question or feedback).

We will also collect information about your computer as you browse our Sites.   Please see TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES below.

**TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES / COOKIES**

Our Sites have features that automatically collect information from you to assist us in creating Sites that honor your preferences and serve your needs, allow us to improve our Sites and provide you with tailored advertising.   In certain instances, our Sites uses cookies, which are small data files containing information about you that are stored on your hard drive.  Cookies are embedded in the HTTP information that travels back and forth between your computer and the servers.  Cookies allow automated customer customization and personalization, and, for example, cookies may be utilized to assure that a sweepstakes applicant enters any given sweepstakes only once or to store session preferences.

We use the following types of cookies on our Sites:

_Strictly necessary cookies_. These cookies are essential for the operation of our Sites and include, for example, cookies that enable you to browse our Sites and use its features and to maintain secure areas of our Sites.

_Analytical/performance cookies_. These cookies collect anonymous information about how you use our Sites for example how you arrived at our Sites and which pages you visit most often.  This helps us to improve the way our Sites work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. These cookies are sometimes placed by third-party providers of web traffic analysis services, such as Google Analytics.

_Functionality cookies_. These are used to recognize you when you return to our Sites in order to improve your experience on our Sites, allowing us to personalize our content for you.

_Targeting cookies_. These cookies record your visit to our Sites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed.  These cookies are usually placed by third-party advertising networks. They remember the other websites you visit, and this information is shared with third-party organizations, for example advertisers.

_Social Media cookies_.  These cookies allow you to share what you’ve been doing on our Sites with social media organizations such as Facebook and Twitter. These cookies are not within our control. Please refer to the privacy policies of these organizations for how their cookies work.

_Web Beacons_

We, or our third party partners, may employ a software technology called web beacons (also known as web bugs, clear gifs or pixels) which helps us understand what content is effective, for example by counting the number of users who have visited these pages, and to understand usage patterns. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to let us know when content is viewed. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded on web pages, ads, and e-mail. We, or our third-party partners, may tie the information gathered by web beacons to the other information we collect about you.

**HOW YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE USED**

_Legal Basis for Data Processing_ : We process personal information for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, as described above. Our legal basis to process personal information includes processing that is: necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us (for example, to provide you with the services you request and to identify and authenticate you so you may use the Sites); necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the Sites); and based on consent by our customers (for example, to communicate with you about our products and services and provide you with marketing information), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by using preference settings in emails or on our Sites or emailing us as set out in the CONTACT US section below) without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

We may use automated decision-making technologies, including profiling, to support our data processing activities. Our automated decision-making capabilities include logic that attempts to identify artists, music, communications, products, or offers that we believe may interest you. By using this logic, it helps us personalize your interactions with us and our artists. For you, this means that you may see online advertisements, direct marketing communications (if you have subscribed), or other advertising or marketing messages or special offers based on your activity on our Sites or interactions with us or our third-party partners.

In some instances, you may be required to provide us with personal information for processing as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you the ability to use all the features of the Sites.

_International transfers:_   Our sharing of your personal information, in accordance with this privacy policy, may involve transferring your information outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring, where required by law, at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * transferring personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
  * using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or
  * transferring personal data to the United States to an entity if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
