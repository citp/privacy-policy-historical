Children and parents, take careful note of the following information: 

Parental consent and the UpToTen User Account

In compliance with [COPPA](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html) (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and all European legislation currently in force, only the parents and legal guardians are permitted to give personally identifiable information concerning of child 12 and under: To comply with these laws, we have created the UpToTen User Account. 

Through the UpToTen User Account, the child's parent or legal guardian can send all the information concerning their child(ren) that is necessary for the subscription process. The information we ask for allows us to deliver a personalized and fulfilling experience for club members.   
Through the UpToTen User Account, the child's parent or legal guardian has immediate access to and complete control over the personally identifiable information UpToTen holds concerning them. The parent / guardian can modify or delete that information at any time through the UpToTen User Account. 

What sort of information is collected by this site ? 

This site is home to a multitude of activities, games and services for both parents and children.   
Only children accompanied by an adult can access UpToTen Kids. We ask the parent or guardian to identify themselves and to open a free UpToTen User Account before we allow access to the child. Some of the data collected is personally identifiable information (first and last names, professional or home address, email address...), and some is not ( gender, age, browser used on the PC...)

We collect personally identifiable information concerning the parent or guardian during the sign-up process. For the Boowa and Kwala club, we require personally identifiable information about the child. The inscription for the Club can only be completed via a valid UpToTen User Account. The data we collect concerning children under the age of 13 is therefore provided by their parent or guardian (in compliance with [COPPA](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html) (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and all European legislation currently in force).

The following text aims to clearly state UpToTen's policy concerning personal data collected on the site. We will explain how the information is collected and for what reasons. 

UpToTen does not sell, exchange or broadcast publicly information provided by users without their consent and this in strict accordance with the relevant applicable laws (the [COPPA](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html), for example). UpToTen respects the concerns and private lives of its visitors and their families. All information given remains the sole property of UpToTen. 

UpToTen will partner with commercial institutions in order to offer club members and UpToTen User Account holders quality products and services. Unless otherwise stated, adhesion to UpToTen via a Boowa & Kwala Club membership or an UpToTen User Account gives the adherent access to direct promotion for UpToTen products and those of carefully chosen partners. 

Our partners' products will be recommended by Boowa and Kwala and will therefore be quality, well-known brands that are suitable for Boowa and Kwala fans. 

UpToTen makes every effort to ensure that it complies with all relevant laws and regulations and will make prior inquiries with conversant authorities.

We collect this information only from the parent or legal guardian. We only collect such information as is absolutely necessary to offer the future member a full, personalized service. We make our best efforts to ensure that the information collected is always the strict minimum. 

Should we require more information than is provided in the Boowa and Kwala club subscription process, we will request such information only through the parent / guardian and in full respect of the [COPPA](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html). 

Parents / legal guardians have the right of access to all personally identifiable data we hold concerning their child(ren). They also have the right to have this information modified or deleted. Parents can exercise this right through their UpToTen User Account.

UpToTen can use this information for awarding prizes, checking the participants' compliance with regulations, publication or replying (all usage of this type will be clearly indicated and explained to visitors as and when they are asked to provide information), for internal use such as assessing the level of interest of the various site modules for visitors to enable UpToTen to provide the best possible personalized service.

YOUR UPTOTEN USER ACCOUNT 

Communication security 

You are the only person who has access to your e-mail account. This is the reason that we use your e-mail address to identify you (your UpToTen User Account Username). 

We can ensure your privacy by communicating with you solely via this e-mail address as you are the only possible recipient. Sending your password to this address, for example, is therefore safe. 

General Conditions that apply to our privacy policy

Although UpToTen follows and complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, the regulations promulgated thereunder and the currently applicable European laws concerning children on the Internet, this does not guarantee safety or that the relevant person is a child or a parent or legal guardian, and UpToTen does not guarantee the actual identities claimed by its users.

That's why we advise all users to practice safe computing and urge parents to advise their children not to give out any personally identifiable information without their consent.

UpToTen makes no guarantees, warranties or representations that you or your child will be absolutely safe or insulated from inappropriate content or behavior and we do not guarantee, warrant or represent that a child will not try to circumvent, or be successful in circumventing, the features on our site. Furthermore, UpToTen does not assume any obligations, liability, or responsibilities associated with such behavior or associated with the obligations of parental supervision. 

UpToTen reserves the right to change the information, features, products, policies, promotions, disclosures and disclaimers at any time. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the UpToTen site. Please check these terms periodically for changes. At the top of the policy we indicate the date of the last update. The continued use of the UpToTen web site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept such changes, and any off-line consent provided under COPPA will be deemed to apply to the revised policies and new or modified features. However, in the event there is a material change in our data collection, use or disclosure practices, we will obtain a new consent.

These contractual conditions shall be analyzed and governed by the laws of MAURITIUS without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
