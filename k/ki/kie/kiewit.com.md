# Kiewit : Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

Peter Kiewit Sons', Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Kiewit") own and operate a number of Internet domains, including but not limited to this Website (the "Website"). This statement describes Kiewit's Website privacy policies.

### Privacy Philosophy

The Internet is rapidly changing the way we communicate and interact. While the Internet may provide access to more information and services than ever before, online activities raise new challenges, such as the privacy issues addressed in this policy. We welcome your feedback regarding this Website and our Privacy Policy. Please address all comments to [webmaster@kiewit.com](mailto:webmaster@kiewit.com).

### What Information is Collected?

You may be asked at various times to provide data such as your name, e-mail address and phone number (the "Personally Identifiable Information"), as well as information about what you like or do not like about the Website. Kiewit collects Personally Identifiable Information online primarily to make it easier for you to use the Website, to allow us to improve our website and our services, and for us to communicate with you.

Our data collection policies are intended to allow you to choose how much Personally Identifiable Information to provide to us. Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:

Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot easily be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that 10,000 people visit this Privacy Policy page today, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth.

Personally Identifiable Information tells us who you are. We may need this information to provide personalized or enhanced service that you request. While we hope that you will find it beneficial to judiciously provide Personally Identifiable Information so that we can provide the best practical service to you, the amount of Personally Identifiable Information that you choose to disclose is a decision you make.

When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser automatically transmits some information to Kiewit every time you access our Website. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, and the browser version you are using to access our site. Some of this information may be collected by Kiewit to help us improve our Website and our services. For instance, we may use this information to ensure the content you request is presented in the best format.

To activate some of the features available within the Website, we may assign "cookies" to your Internet browser. On our system, a cookie is a small text file that contains a unique identification number stored on your computer. This unique identification number automatically identifies your browser to our server computers when you interact with our Website. When you agree to provide Personally Identifiable Information directly to us, we may assign cookies that identify you, personally, to our servers.

### What organization is collecting the information?

The data you provide is collected by Kiewit. Some areas of our Website read data that creates, or has created, an Anonymous Profile. Other areas require you to register or login before you can access an area of the Website. These areas read and store Personally Identifiable Information that specifically identifies you to our servers.

### How will the Anonymous Profile Information be used?

Below is a description of some of the uses of the information that we collect and how our users benefit from these actions:

We try to pay attention to what our users use and do not use on our Website, and we modify our content appropriately. Many of the pages in our Website collect Anonymous Profile Information. The creation of an anonymous profile allows Kiewit to identify the information that users find most useful. We may use these anonymous profiles to improve our Website's content and format, and our company's services. This is essential to our ability to provide high quality content to you.

### How will the Personally Identifiable Information be used?

Our Website may require that you provide Personally Identifiable Information to use a Website feature. We may use this information for internal research regarding the use of our Website and to facilitate the feature you choose to use.
