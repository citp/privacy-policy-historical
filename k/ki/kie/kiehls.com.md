When you visit the Kiehl's website, like when you visit most other websites, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, which may include information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the internet (such as "aol.com" or "earthlink.net"), the date and time you access the site, the pages you access while at the Kiehl's website, and the internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to the Kiehl's site. This information is not personally identifiable.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, social security number, email address or any information you submitted to kiehls.com that identifies you individually.

kiehls.com will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it. Therefore, if you do not want kiehls.com to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, do not submit it. 

You can visit and browse the Kiehl's website without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself. You may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information about yourself, which may be maintained as described below. kiehls.com may collect personally identifiable information about you from its website by methods such as the following:
