European Union-Swiss Privacy Policy</h2> RealPage, Inc. and its group companies (collectively, “RealPage”, “we”, “our”, “us”) are committed to providing our product and service users (“clients”, “you”) with clear and concise information regarding our privacy policy and practices. This Privacy Policy describes in detail our policy and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of client information by our subsidiary, Kigo, Inc., doing business as Kigo. By accessing our websites or utilizing our products and services, you consent to the information collection and handling practices outlined in this policy.This Privacy Policy was last updated on June 23, 2014. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time so please check back regularly to keep informed of any updates.<h3>Scope</h3> This Privacy Policy describes in detail our policy and practices regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of client information only. This Privacy Policy does not apply in respect of any data we process on behalf of our clients in the course of providing our products and services to them, including personal data relating to customers of our clients, and vendors which our clients have formalized business arrangements with. Any such individuals with questions about the uses of their data by our clients should contact the relevant client directly.<h3>What information we collect</h3> RealPage may collect various types of client information through our products, services, and websites. The information is gathered from your usage of our products and services, as well as from your entry of information on our websites. This collected information consists of two basic types of data: 1) personal information and 2) device information.Personal information is information that can be used to uniquely identify you as an individual or contact you directly. This may include contact information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. For certain financial, health, or credit-based products and services, personal information may also include sensitive data such as payment data, credit records, social security numbers, date of birth, and account numbers. Personal information is only collected based upon your choice to provide it to RealPage through our products, services, and websites. You have the option to choose not to provide personal information to us; however, the lack of such personal information will typically prevent RealPage from providing the requested products or services to you.If you provide us personal information about others, such as your customers and vendors with whom you have formalized business arrangements with, we will only use that information in accordance with your instructions and for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.Device information is general information that does not permit direct association with you as an individual. When you browse RealPage websites, we may automatically collect device information such as your IP address, browser, internet connection speed, past web pages visited, and your link selections on our various website pages. This information may be used to: (1) manage and protect our websites, products, services, and users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; and (2) help us research, develop, and improve our websites, products, and services. This type of information may also be aggregated or otherwise rendered anonymous for business and marketing uses by us or by third parties.<h3>How we use the information</h3> Your information will be used to enable us to provide you with the products or services you have requested from us. We may also process your information for operational and marketing purposes, so that we can improve our products and services to better meet our clients’ needs, as described further below.<h3>Who has access to your data?</h3> Except as explained in this Privacy Policy, RealPage does not sell, license, or share our users’ information outside the RealPage family of companies without the consent and authorization of the user whose information will be shared.We may share your information within the <a href="http://www.realpage.com/company/" target="_blank">RealPage family of companies, products, and services</a> for operational and marketing purposes.

Every marketing e-mail RealPage sends contains instructions and procedures allowing you to opt out of additional marketing e-mails for that product or service.In some circumstances, we use third-party companies, agents, and contractors to perform services on our behalf, such as website optimization, email distribution, processing credit card transactions, infrastructure and IT services, background screening, and other data processing or handling functions.
