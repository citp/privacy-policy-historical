However, we must cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer. We do reserve the right to send emails on behalf of our partners and affiliates.

The amount and type of information that Kirkus Media LLC gathers and stores depends on the nature of the interaction.

 **Information We Need**

We ask for your phone number in the event that our customer service representatives or delivery services need to contact you about your order.

We store all files uploaded for author services (example, manuscripts), personal information (example, email addresses), and project information (example, book titles) on a secure server and restrict access to only the professionals contracted to work on your project and key Kirkus personnel. Contracted professionals are required to sign non-disclosure agreements prior to working on any Kirkus projects.
