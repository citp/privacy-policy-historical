# Privacy Policy – Kiwiblog

When you browse this site, the following information is recorded and made available to me:

The pages you browse on my site  
The referring page or link you came from  
The search engine query you used to find the blog  
Your IP adddress  
Your machine name  
Your web browser version  
Your operating system  
The e-mail address you used to register  
Your user name if registered  
Your IQ (okay not that one)

I reserve the right to use or publicise any of the above information. However, unless there is good reason, I intend to only publish information in summarised form (such as 44% of browsers used are Firefox) or with no personal details (such as machine name or IP address) attached. The most common information published will be amusing search engine queries.

If you post a comment on my blog, your IP address plus the date and time you made the comment are recorded. If you vote in a blog poll your user name (if registered) and IP address are recorded.

I retain this information for at least a year and will in all circumstances release it to NZ authorities if presented with a warrant. I may hand it over without a warrant also, if I think a comment broke the law or was defamatory. I reserve all rights to do what I see fit with this information, as it is my site.

I have given information to the Police on ~~two~~ **three** occasions. Once in relation to threats made by a user against an MP, once in relation to a murder investigation, and once in relation to flagrant and deliberate breach of suppression orders.

However those who know me will testify that I only try to screw someone over, if they have done something particularly nasty aimed at me. I’ve only twice needed to retaliate in the last ten years, so it is very hard to get onto my revenge list. The bad news is that there is no known method to get off the list, once on it 

So the bottom line in terms of privacy in browsing or commenting on this site, is that in 99.99% of all cases I will keep your personal information strictly confidential to me. However if you break the law, defame someone, or really piss me off, then you have been warned!

[Kiwiblog](https://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/kiwiblog "Posts tagged with Kiwiblog") installs the latest software updates as they become available. However WordPress, like all systems, does have vulnerabilities that can be exploited despite our best efforts. To the best of my knowledge this has never happened, but [Kiwiblog](https://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/kiwiblog "Posts tagged with Kiwiblog") can not guarantee it never will happen. If a user wishes to maximise their privacy they should consider not using any directly identifiable information in their usernames and registered e-mail addresses. Also you are best to use a unique password for [Kiwiblog](https://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/tag/kiwiblog "Posts tagged with Kiwiblog").
