**WHO WE ARE**

May Media Group LLC is the registrant of KIWIMAGONLINE.COM. 

**WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU**

KIWIMAGONLINE.COM asks adults that subscribe to our publication(s), make purchases on our website, participate in our surveys, contests, sweepstakes and other offerings, to provide certain personal information, including name, mailing address, e-mail address and phone number.   Participants may optionally provide additional information which may include, age, gender, education, marital status, etc.   The type of information requested is specifically tailored to the particular offering (e.g. number of children in household, preferences for food products, healthcare, etc.).  

**HOW WE USE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU**

We use the information you supply through KIWIMAGONLINE.COM to provide you with the information or service you requested, to enhance your experience on our website, and for internal business purposes consistent with this policy.   For example, if you subscribe to any of our publications, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to send you the publication, or, if you enter one of our contests, we will use this information to notify you if you won.   We may also use the information to tell you about   publications, products or services that we believe will interest you, or improve existing services and product offerings by tailoring them to your interests.   While your individual information is protected as described in this privacy policy, we reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as finding compatible advertisers and partners and analyzing usage trends. 

We also share certain information with our affiliates, and certain companies who we believe can offer you products and services that may interest you.   If you do not wish to have your information shared, write to us at [webmaster@kiwimagonline.com](mailto:webmaster@kiwimagonline.com)[](mailto:webmaster@maymediagroup.com). 

Certain third parties may need access to your information for the sole purpose of providing you the service you requested.   For example, if you purchase products through our website, we may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment.   Your information may also be disclosed if the law requires us to do so in connection with investigations or other legal proceedings. 

**THIRD PARTY ADVERTISEMENTS**

We may provide your information to our advertisers so you see ads and are able to link to other sites that may interest you.   However, our Privacy Policy does not cover information collected on those third party sites, and these third party companies are not bound by our Privacy Policy.   Always consult the other site's privacy policies before providing any information on those sites, as KIWIMAGONLINE.COM does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. 

**TECHNOLOGY WE USE**

KIWIMAGONLINE uses "cookies" to enhance your online experience.   A "cookie" is a data file containing user-specific information that a website transfers to the user's computer.   Cookies help us keep track of your patterns and preferences so that we may improve the content and offerings on our website.   For example, we may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you enter our site, and to offer you products or services you may like. 

Cookies alone do not contain personally identifiable information, such as name, e-mail address, etc.   However, once you furnish such personally identifiable information through our website, this information may be linked to the information stored in the "cookie."   We may also use "web beacons" or similar technologies to collect non-personal aggregate information such as browser type, operating system, pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. 

Some of our advertisers may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies as well, which are subject to each advertiser's own privacy policies, not ours, and KIWIMAGONLINE.COM disclaims all liability in connection therewith.  

You may be able to control the use of cookies by modifying your Web browser to reject cookies.   However, if you do that, some portions of KIWIMAGONLINE.COM may not function properly. 

KIWIMAGONLINE.COM automatically identifies your "IP Address" which is the unique location where you entered the Internet (e.g. the computer at your desk at work).   We collect IP Addresses and use them to keep track of broad demographic statistics, like how many people visit our site, and to diagnose problems with our server or to administer our website. 

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

We do not collect any personally identifiable information from children. 

**CHANGES TO THIS POLICY**

This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time, and the date of the most recent revision will appear at on this page.   Your continued access to KIWIMAGONLINE.COM constitutes your acceptance of any changes or revisions to our Privacy Policy.
