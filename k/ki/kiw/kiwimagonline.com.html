    <strong>TECHNOLOGY WE USE </strong></p>
<p align="left">KIWIMAGONLINE uses "cookies" to enhance your online experience. &nbsp; A "cookie" is a data file containing user-specific information that a website transfers to the user's computer. &nbsp; Cookies help us keep track of your patterns and preferences so that we may improve the content and offerings on our website. &nbsp; For example, we may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you enter our site, and to offer you products or services you may like. </p>
<p align="left">Cookies alone do not contain personally identifiable information, such as name, e-mail address, etc. &nbsp; However, once you furnish such personally identifiable information through our website, this information may be linked to the information stored in the "cookie." &nbsp; We may also use "web beacons" or similar technologies to collect non-personal aggregate information such as browser type, operating system, pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. </p>
<p align="left">Some of our advertisers may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies as well, which are subject to each advertiser's own privacy policies, not ours, and KIWIMAGONLINE.COM disclaims all liability in connection therewith. &nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">You may be able to control the use of cookies by modifying your Web browser to reject cookies. &nbsp; However, if you do that, some portions of KIWIMAGONLINE.COM may not function properly. </p>
<p align="left">KIWIMAGONLINE.COM automatically identifies your "IP Address" which is the unique location where you entered the Internet (e.g. the computer at your desk at work). &nbsp; We collect IP Addresses and use them to keep track of broad demographic statistics, like how many people visit our site, and to diagnose problems with our server or to administer our website. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong> </p>
<p align="left">We do not collect any personally identifiable information from children. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</strong></p>
