# KitchenAid® Privacy Statement

|   


KitchenAid® takes the protection of its customers' personal information very seriously. You can generally browse our Web site without providing any personal information. There are only a few places where we request a small amount of personal information; and we want to make sure that you understand what that information is used for and how it will be protected. We make every effort to ensure that any data collected is accurate, timely and secure.

KitchenAid does not rent, sell or otherwise distribute the customer information entered on this site.

Generally, the information KitchenAid collects helps us to provide you with the latest product information, promotional information and other information that we feel you may find useful. If you have provided personal information, but do not wish to receive further information from KitchenAid, you can simply respond to our e-mail and tell us that you do not want to receive future communications.
