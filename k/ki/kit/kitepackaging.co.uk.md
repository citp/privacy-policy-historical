**Marketing**   


We may from time to time contact you to make you aware of new products and services, unless you explicitly request us not to do so. 

If you have made a purchase from Kite Packaging pre-dating 25th May 2018, you mayreceive regular product recommendations from us by e-mail. If you no longer wish to receive such communications, you can opt out by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any Kite Packaging marketing e-mail. 

If you are a new customer, you can opt out of email communications at the new customer billing stage of the basket. This will ensure we do not send you promotional material via email.

We will never share your name and contact details with 3rd parties for marketing purposes. We do use 3rd party service providers to send out marketing material but only allow them to use that information on our instructions and where they have agreed to treat the information confidentially and to comply with data protection legislation. 

**Data security**   


We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your information.
