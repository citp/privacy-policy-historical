**Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is very important to us and we are strongly committed to protecting it.  
Our privacy policy is clear – we do not sell or rent your personal information without your explicit permission.

We may collect your personal information that can identify you when you visit / register / post information and use our site in other ways.  
Please be aware that certain information such as your name, nickname, country, images, comments, posts and other information that you (and other site visitors)  
provide during registration and/or posting on our site, communicating with other users, or by using the sites in other ways may be displayed to any visitor of the site  
and/or cashed, indexed, retrieved, displayed and used by search engines and third party sites.  
We cannot control who accesses such information and how this information is used.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a visitor’s browser by a killurtime.com.  
The browser provides this piece of text to the originating Web site when this visitor returns.  
A “persistent” cookie may be used to help save your settings and customizations across site visits.  
Also, if you log in to your account, such a cookie will be used to recognize you as a valid user so you will not need to log in each time you visit the killurtime.com.  
Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent.  
Also, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any time. Please note that many features of the Acidcow.com may not function properly when cookies are disabled or removed.

**Log Files**

As with most other websites, our server logs automatically collect your IP/ISP addresses, your internet browser type and language used, the country, date and time of your visit, pages / services used on the site and other information.  
Such information may be used to track user activity and navigation around the site and its services and the dynamics and trends connected to the use of the site.  
Collected demographic and other information may be also used for statistical and administrative purposes.

**Changes to our privacy policy**

Privacy policy is subject to change upon our discretion.  
Any user/visitor of the site is deemed to have acknowledged privacy policy of the site when using the site and/or its services.  
We encourage you to check it frequently.
