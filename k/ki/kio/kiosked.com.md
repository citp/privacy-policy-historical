###### I. Introduction

We at Kiosked Ltd. (“We,” Us”) think that privacy and the protection of personal data are a very important element of the user experience of [www.kiosked.com](http://www.kiosked.com/) (the “Service”), as described in our [Terms of Use](http://www.kiosked.com/terms-of-use/ "Terms of use").  In this Privacy Policy, the term “personal data” means information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person.  This Privacy Policy tells you about the ways in which we protect your privacy and personal data we process about you.

We know that you, the user of the Service, are concerned about how we use and disclose personal data.  We are dedicated to openness regarding the ways in which we use and disclose personal data, and we are committed to complying with data protection and privacy laws that apply to us.  Importantly, we want to give you control over personal data that we process about you when you use the Service.

We wish to remind you that this Privacy Policy applies to personal data that we process when you use the Service.  It does not apply to any links to third parties’ websites and/or services, such as third-party applications, that you may encounter when you use the Service.  We encourage you to carefully familiarize yourself with privacy policies applicable to any websites and/or services operated by third parties.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties.

Please be careful when sharing personal data about you generally in the Service and with other users of the Service.  Also, submitting personal data relating to other individuals, such as pictures or contact information, may violate their privacy and data protection rights.  Thus, please obtain consent from the individual whose personal data you are about to submit to the Service before you submit such data.
