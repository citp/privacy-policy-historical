    <h1>Data Protection Policy</h1>   
    <p>Kaplan International Colleges is committed to maintaining the privacy of your personal information. This Data Protection Policy describes how we treat information received about you.</p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>So that we can provide you with the information, programmes or products you have requested, we 
      collect and store certain information about you, including your name, telephone number, email 
      address, postal address, age, educational background, credit card number and other payment 
      information. If you are enrolling as a student, we also may also collect other personal data, such as 
      information regarding your health so that, if necessary, we can make appropriate accommodation 
      for you, or your race or ethnicity, so that we can report aggregate student diversity statistics. This 
      data is considered “sensitive data” and you consent to our collection, storage and use of such 
      sensitive data for these purposes.</p>
    <p>We also may collect from you emergency contact information, such as the telephone number or 
      email address for a friend or family member. You represent to us that you have obtained consent 
      from your emergency contacts to provide us their information for this purpose. </p>
    <h2>How We Use Information Collected</h2>
    <p>We use this information to process your requests, review and confirm your qualifications, provide 
      you with our materials and programmes and to otherwise contract with you. We also may provide 
      you with promotional materials about our products and services and provide your information to our 
      affiliates and other carefully selected companies, some of whom may be outside the EU, who would 
      like to send you promotional materials about their products and services.</p>
    <h2>Your Ability to Choose</h2>
    <p>You can let us know that you do not wish to receive promotional material from us by contacting us 
      by email at kicinfo@kaplan.com or by post at 52 Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1W 0AU. You also 
      can let us know that you do not want us to share your information with our affiliates or other 
      carefully selected companies for promotional purposes by contacting us at the same email or postal 
      address.</p>
    <h2>Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We may hire other companies to perform services on our behalf including, without limitation, 
      facilitating some aspects of our website and services, managing our database, sending email and 
      other mail to you, processing and collecting payments, providing us legal, financial and accounting 
      advice and conducting required audits. These other companies may be supplied with or have 
      access to your information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf. 
      We also may disclose personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is 
      necessary under the law (for example, when necessary to protect our or a third party's intellectual 
      property or proprietary rights) or when we, at our sole discretion, believe it is appropriate, in 
      connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, or when we, in good faith, believe that 
      the law requires us to do so.</p>
    <p>Your personal data is accessible by and provided to our partner university, for administration 
      purposes, such as keeping track of your student records, accepting and recording your payments,
      providing you with certificates of completion and complying with any regulatory reporting
      requirements. We may also provide your data to companies or authorities from which you seek
      funding. If you have enrolled in our programmes through your sponsor or employer, we may share
      your data and course attendance and study results with your sponsor or employer. Such third
      parties are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Contact our partner universities/your employer or
      sponsor/any funding institutions/ companies directly for information about how they treat your
      personal data.</p>
    <h2>Transfer to Other Countries</h2>
    <p>We may need to process and store your information in countries outside the EU (and not subject to
      EU Data Protection laws), including, without limitation, your home country, the country in which you
      plan to graduate or other countries where we have offices or service providers. By providing your
      information to us, you consent to transfer of your information to these other countries.      </p>
    <h2>Access and Rectification</h2>
    <p>If you would like to review, change or delete any information that we have about you, you can do so
