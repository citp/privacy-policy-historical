<h3>Please read the following carefully</h3>
<p>General information about the policy of this website in its collection, protection, use and disclosure of the personal information gathered on this site. If you are under 18 years of age, please be sure to read this privacy statement with your parents or guardian and ask them questions about what you don’t understand.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>In this Privacy Policy Kickboard Inc. is referred to as “Kickboard,” “we,” “us,” or “our”&nbsp;and you, the end user, are referred to as “you” or “your”.<br>
Certain Kickboard®&nbsp;websites are freely accessible (“Kickboard Corporate Websites”). Other Kickboard websites are restricted to those who are authorized to access them by Kickboard and have a user name and password (“Kickboard Customer Websites”); these Kickboard Customer Websites include Kickboard platform solutions made available through such websites (“Kickboard Platform”). This Privacy Policy describes the type of information we may collect from users through both the Kickboard Corporate and Customer Websites (the&nbsp;”Kickboard websites”), how we use that information, and with whom we may share it.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by Kickboard offline or in any other way.</p>
<p>The Kickboard websites include links to websites operated by others. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties, and this policy does not apply to any information collected by such third party websites.</p>
<h4>Modification</h4>
<p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any revisions will be effective upon posting.</p>
<h4>How We May Collect Personal Information</h4>
<p>We may collect information that personally identifies you when you obtain a user name and password, when you the Kickboard Platform or when you otherwise communicate with us through a Kickboard website. We may also obtain your personal information through a Kickboard website if it is submitted by a representative of the institution (such as a school, school district, state department of education or other educational organization) or by the individual (such as a parent or guardian) funding your access to the Kickboard Platform (“Sponsoring Organization”).</p>
<h4>What personal information do we collect and use</h4>
<p>We consider the following to be examples of Personally Identifiable Information but there may be others: your first and last name, email address, home address, phone number, date of birth, credit card information, and certain other information, such as a Social Security Number, if it is linked with your Personally Identifiable Information. We strongly recommend that you not use your Social Security Number or any other important ID as a user ID or password for this Site or others.</p>
<p>Kickboard does not collect Personally Identifiable Information about a user, unless it is voluntarily provided to us and so that we can serve the user’s needs and our legitimate business purposes as stated here. For example, when the user sends us a message or makes an online purchase, we need to retain certain Personally Identifiable Information on this Site in order to respond. A user’s Personally Identifiable Information may also be used by us to help improve this Site, and for our company’s marketing and promotional purposes. The information will be treated confidentially within Kickboard, as we protect other confidential information. You can choose not to provide certain information, which may preclude your access to certain parts of Kickboard websites.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>How Information Is Used and Shared</h3>
<h4>Kickboard Support</h4>
<p>We may use your personal information to provide user support to you and your school or Sponsoring Organization for your use of the Kickboard websites.</p>
<h4>Kickboard Communications</h4>
<p>We may send you communications about updates, services and new Kickboard offerings from time to time. If you do not want to receive these communications you can opt out by sending an email to&nbsp;support@kickboardforteachers.com or by such other manner as may be indicated in such communications.</p>
<h4>Legal Requirements</h4>
<p>Kickboard reserves the right to disclose your personal information as necessary to: (1) comply with any applicable federal, state or local law or regulation, including to comply with any subpoena, court order, or legal process served on Kickboard; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Kickboard; (3) protect the personal safety of other Kickboard websites users or the public; or (4) to ensure compliance with our Terms of Use, including the Terms of Use for the Kickboard Corporate Websites and the Terms of Use for the Kickboard Customer Websites. Kickboard cooperates with law enforcement and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property, and other rights. We reserve the right to report suspicious activity to law enforcement for prosecution.</p>
<h4>Business Transfers</h4>
<p>Information about Kickboard websites users, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of Kickboard.</p>
<h4>Third Parties</h4>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties. Kickboard may, however, use for its own purposes, aggregate information that does not identify you personally, or share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.</p>
<h4>Children and Our Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from Children on this Site either directly or passively except when a Child may voluntarily submit such information through a “Contact Us” link on a Kickboard Website or a public posting area on a Kickboard Website, if such feature is available. If a Child e-mails us via a “Contact Us” link and we can identify the sender as a Child, any Personally Identifiable Information submitted will only be used to respond on a one-time basis to such Child. In addition, if we have actual knowledge that a Child is sending or posting Personally Identifiable Information on any area of this Site, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such Personally Identifiable Information before it is made public.<br>
We may disclose a Child’s Personally Identifiable Information if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose a Child’s Personally Identifiable Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
<h4>Non-personal User Information</h4>
<p>An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Internet. When you request pages from Kickboard websites, our servers log your computer’s IP address. Kickboard collects these IP addresses for the sole purpose of identifying our users’ service providers (whether AOL, MSN, etc.) so we can better develop our offerings at the Kickboard websites. We do not automatically link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, however we can and will use IP addresses to identify users when we feel it is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Kickboard; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Kickboard; (3) protect the personal safety of other Kickboard websites users or the public; or (4) to ensure compliance with our Terms of Use, including the&nbsp;Terms of Use for the Kickboard Corporate Websites&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Terms of Use for the Kickboard Customer Websites.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Kickboard Websites use “cookies” to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses a Kickboard Website, Cookies are textual identifiers that our systems transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable the Kickboard Website to recognize your browser, and to optimize and sometimes customize your use of our Site. If you want to disable cookies, you can. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers and “add-on” programs will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. It is your choice, but cookies allow you to take full advantage of Kickboard Website features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
<p>We do not use cookies to get users’ Personally Identifiable Information before a user registers with a Kickboard Website and affirmatively opts-in. Once a user opts-in and provides personal information for purposes of receiving more information from us, we do collect and use that information obtained through the cookie technology for purposes of marketing to you, in accordance with this policy. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other marketing communications from us, you can opt out of further marketing to the addresses you have provided.</p>
<p>In connection with cookies we may use web beacons to track response rates to certain email communications that a user has opted to receive from us. If a user has registered with our Site, we may collect certain personal information in connection with the web beacon including the referring email address. This information is not shared with third parties.</p>
<p>Kickboard reserves the right to monitor your use of Kickboard Websites to determine if you are complying with our terms of use and the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to a Kickboard Website.</p>
<h3>Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Privacy</h3>
<h4>Links to Other Websites</h4>
<p>You should be aware that when you are on any Kickboard website, you could be directed by links or otherwise to other websites hosted by third parties. We do not endorse those websites. For example, if you “click” a link to a third party site we have listed on one of the pages on the Kickboard websites, the “click” takes you off the applicable Kickboard websites. Kickboard is not responsible for the content or information collection practices of any third party websites. Please note that these websites may have privacy policies that differ from this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information.</p>
<h4>What You Disclose</h4>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online – for example, via message boards, forums, or chats – that information can be viewed and used by people that you do not know, including but not limited to other students who access the Kickboard websites. Kickboard does not control their use of that information.</p>
<h4>No Guarantee of Security</h4>
<p>No data transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure. Kickboard does not ensure or warrant the security of any personal or other information you transmit to us including without limitation via the Kickboard websites.</p>
