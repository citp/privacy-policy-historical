# KickoffLabs LLC Privacy Policy - KickoffLabs

**Last Updated: September 8th, 2015**

Your privacy and the privacy of your customers are critically important to us. At KickoffLabs LLC (“KickoffLabs”, “We”, “Us”, or “Our”), we have a few fundamental principles:

We don’t and won’t ask you for personally identifying information unless we truly need it. (Until we have a good reason for needing your gender and income level, what’s the point?) We ask that you do the same with any site(s) you create using Our Services (“Your Sites”). To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, www.kickofflabs.wpengine.com, and Our products and services and are collectively called the “Services.”

We don’t share your personally identifying information, or data you collect through Your Sites, with anyone, except as needed, to provide product support, to comply with the law, or to protect Our rights.

We don’t store personal or customer information from Your Sites on Our servers unless required for the on-going operation of Our Services. 

You are in control of the information you share through Your Sites and the customer data you collect is your responsibility. As part of the Terms of Service, available at www.kickofflabs.wpengine.com/terms, we require that you respect other Users’ and your customers’ rights to privacy in the same manner you’d require your data to be respected.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of third parties whose links may appear on or through the Services. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third parties or other Users.

We recommend that you exercise caution before you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information to other users, on publically accessible or displayable parts of the Service, or through third-party links on third-party websites or platforms.

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our Support team at [support@kickofflabs.com](mailto:support@kickofflabs.com?subject=Privacy%2520Question:%2520)

## Collection and Use of Information

**Email Addresses.**

We **do not** and **will not** send spam, sell or rent your email address or any social media login account (“Account”) information to third parties. We **do not** disclose, sell, share, trade or give away a User’s personal information to third parties, except as needed for completing payment and billing transactions through the services of payment processing vendors, if applicable. We **do not** email your customers directly, for any reason. Please note that given the nature of our services, emails may be generated on your behalf through our service and may bear the Kickofflabs branding. You are still responsible for the content of those emails complying with our policies and each of our respective privacy policies. 

**Logging Statistics**

Like most website operators, Our servers automatically collect certain types of non-personally-identifying, technical information, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We use this information to better understand how Our visitors use Our website, and to maintain Services. 

**IP Addresses**

Internet Protocol addresses indicate the location of a User’s computers or mobile device on a network connected to the Internet. Providing Services to you may result in the logging of IP addresses for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We do not log IP addresses to track your session, nor do we link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.

**Cookies**

Your use of the Services may result in the assignment and storage of session cookies to recognize your access privileges. A cookie is a text file that is placed on the hard disk of your computer or mobile device by a server. Session cookies expire when you end your session and close your browser interface. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. **** We use cookies to help Us identify and track visitors, their usage of and preferences on Our website. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers or mobile devices should set their browsers to “Refuse Cookies” before using Our Services, with the drawback that certain features of Our Services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

  
KickoffLabs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that: (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Our behalf or to provide the Services; and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Services you consent to the transfer of such information to them. 

If you have an Account with Us for access and use of Our Services, We may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with KickoffLabs and Our Services. We primarily use Our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. 

KickoffLabs takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Feedback & Support

If you send Us a request (via a support email or one of our feedback channels), We reserve the right to publish it (stripped of all personally identifying information, of course) in order to help Us clarify or respond to your request or to help Us support other Users. 

We may provide technical support to service your Account(s) with us. In order to do so, We may use certain personally identifying information, with your consent, to access your account for the purpose of troubleshooting, running tests, and/or otherwise providing support. In providing technical support to you, We may potentially see other personally identifying information viewable on your Account pages. As with all other information, We promise to hold any information we encounter in the process of providing support to the highest possible security and protection standards. 

## Security

To prevent unauthorized access, safeguard data accuracy, and maintain the appropriate use of information, We have put in place appropriate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to protect the personal information data you submit. We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems. However, since the Internet is not 100% secure and as new technology evolves and emerges, We cannot guarantee that Our security measures will prevent third-party interferences from illegally obtaining or tampering with your personal information.

We encourage you to help Us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you use the Services. Change your Account password often, using a combination of letters, numbers, and characters, and make sure you use a secure connection.

## Privacy of Minors

We do not promote or offer the Services for use by anyone under the age of 17 (“minors”). KickoffLabs does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from minors, and we will not knowingly link to any third-party website or platform, or host any of Your Sites that solicit or collect personal information from minors. If you believe that a minor has disclosed personal information to Us or that We have linked to such a third-party or User website or platform, please contact Us at support@kickofflabs.com.

## Safe Harbor and International Users

KickoffLabs abides by the safe harbor framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected from the European Union.

## Business Transfers

If the ownership of KickoffLabs substantially changes, such that all of its assets were acquired, or merged into another entity, or in the unlikely event that KickoffLabs enters bankruptcy, you understand that any stored personally identifying, and non-personally identifying information and data will likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer or merging entity of KickoffLabs may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Privacy Policy Changes

We may change or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, in our sole discretion. We encourage you to frequently check this page for any changes to Our Privacy Policy.
