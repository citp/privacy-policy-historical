We may also use software tools, such as Javascript, to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, and methods used to browse away from the page.

_When and Why We Disclose Personal Information and Non-Personal Data_

Except as provided herein, we will not display on the Site, or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to any third parties unless it is necessary to provide the Services, when required by law, or if we have good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to

_Security of Personal Information_

We employ generally accepted industry standards to protect your personal information and we continuously strive to protect your information and privacy as much as we can. Unfortunately, no data transmission over Wi-Fi or the Internet can be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online.

_Third Party Analytics_

This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information by KICKICO. We may use analytics services to help us analyze the information we have collected from you. These analytics services may use cookies, web beacons and other devices and technologies to track traffic data. Data that they collect typically includes, but is not limited to, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, such technologies placed by third party analytics services.
