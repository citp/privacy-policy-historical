</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Your privacy and the privacy of your customers are critically important to us. At KickoffLabs LLC (“KickoffLabs”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), we have a few fundamental principles:</span>
</p>

<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">We don’t and won’t ask you for personally identifying information unless we truly need it. We ask that you do the same with any site(s) you create using our Services (“Your Sites”).&nbsp;To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, www.kickofflabs.com, and our products and services and are collectively called the “Services” throughout this policy.</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">We don’t share your personally identifying information, or data you collect through your Sites, with anyone, except as needed, to provide product support, to comply with the law, or to protect our rights.</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">We don’t store personal or customer information from Your Sites on Our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our Services. We may store customer information in an anonymized, aggregated manner, for analytics, product development and for the improvement of existing Services.</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">You are in control of the information you share through Your Sites and the customer data you collect is your responsibility. As part of the Terms of Service, available at www.kickofflabs.com/terms, we require that you respect other Users’ and your customers’ rights to privacy in the same manner you’d require your data to be respected.</span>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This Service does not require you to enter any information to view the website or the products and services, however, in order to utilize the Services, Personal Information may be required to deliver the services to you. This information shall be governed by the policy.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of third parties whose links may appear on or through the Services.

We recommend that you exercise caution before you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information to other users, on publicly accessible or displayable parts of the Service, or through third-party links on third-party websites or platforms.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data, please contact our Support team at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@kickofflabs.com?subject=Privacy%25252520Question:%25252520"><span class="s3">support@kickofflabs.com</span></a></span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">Collection and Use of Information</span><span class="s4"><br> <br> </span><span class="s5"><b>Registration Information.</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">

</p>

  <span class="s1">The email address is used for communication of account related activities and, if you are opted in, marketing communication about advancements to our services. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If you are sending email through our service to your own email list we require that you add a valid postal address in order to comply with anti-spam regulation that requires a postal address be sent with outgoing email communications.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We encourage you to exercise caution before voluntarily disclosing other types of personally identifying information about yourself and prohibit you from disclosing any personally identifying information about another person, whether another account holder or not. Personally identifying information generally includes, but is not limited to, a person’s name, address, phone number, titles and any other information that is able to identify an individual.</span>
</p>

<p class="p5">
  <span class="s1"><b>Email Addresses.</b>&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We&nbsp;<b>do not</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>will not</b>&nbsp;send spam, sell or rent your email address or any social media login account information to third parties. We&nbsp;<b>do not </b>disclose, sell, share, trade or give away a User’s personal information to third parties, except as needed for completing payment and billing transactions through the services of payment processing vendors, if applicable. We&nbsp;<b>do not</b>&nbsp;email your customers directly, for any reason. Please note that given the nature of our services, emails may be generated on your behalf through our service and may bear the Kickofflabs branding. You are still responsible for the content of those emails complying with our policies and each of our respective privacy policies.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p class="p5">
  <span class="s1"><b>Logging Statistics</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Like most website operators, our servers automatically collect certain types of non-personally-identifying, technical information, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.</span>
</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">What website you came from to get here</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">How long you stay for</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">What kind of device you’re using</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We use this information to better understand how our visitors use our website, to maintain Services, and to diagnose issues with the service that may arise.</span>
</p>

<p class="p5">
  <span class="s1"><b>Data Aggregation&nbsp;</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In addition to the other uses described in this Policy, you agree that we may extract and use information from the information you disclose for the purposes of aggregating data in a non-identifiable method. This aggregated data may be used internally to improve services or without limitation, to develop, analyze, combine, or publish the aggregated data for commercial purposes.</span>
</p>

<p class="p5">
  <span class="s1"><b>Cookies</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Your use of certain of the Services may result in the assignment and storage of session cookies by Google Analytics to recognize your access privileges and generally track user preferences. A cookie is a text file that is placed on the hard disk of your computer or mobile device by a server. Session cookies expire when you end your session and close your browser interface. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers or mobile devices should deny Cookies in the pop-up window. If Cookies are denied, certain features of our Services may not function properly.</span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">How we Share your Information</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">KickoffLabs takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s4"><br> </span><span class="s1">KickoffLabs discloses potential personally identifying information only on an as needed (or required) basis as follows:</span>
</p>

<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">To KickoffLabs employees that: (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide the Services; and (ii) that have expressly agreed not to disclose it to others. Note; Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Services you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">As required by law such to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process. To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take commercially reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of a legal process.</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a written government request</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">If KickoffLabs becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets. In the event of a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, we will ensure that the acquiring organization agrees to protect personal information in accordance with the commitments we have made in this Privacy Notice, and that the acquiring organization will provide notice before personal information, customer information, or business information becomes subject to a different privacy notice.</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li2">
    <span class="s2">To any other third party with your prior consent to do so. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</span>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">Accessing and Updating your Personal Information</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">To review, access or update your personal information to review its accuracy, or request deletion please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@kickofflabs.com"><span class="s3">support@kickofflabs.com</span></a>.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with reasonable access to any of your personal or other account information we maintain within forty-five (45) days of your request. We provide this access so you can review it, make corrections, or request deletion of your information. If we cannot honor your request within the 45-day period, we will tell you when we will be able to provide access. In the unlikely event that we cannot provide you access to your information, we will explain why we cannot do so.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Please note that any changes you make will be reflected in our active user database within a reasonable time, however we may retain information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud, to satisfy legal obligations, or otherwise we reasonably believe there is a legitimate reason to do so.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We do not offer choices to limit the use of personal information beyond what’s outlined in this privacy policy. We strive to only collect information that is required for our service to properly function. </span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">Communications</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If you have an account with us for access and use of our Services, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with KickoffLabs and our Services. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.</span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">Third Party Services</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">KickoffLabs also uses third party services that provide servers, storage and hosting services, namely Amazon AWS and Heroku. KickoffLabs does not transfer to third party services your personally identifiable information, and removes non-anonymized data immediately upon anonymization, and stores anonymized data on such third party providers.</span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">Feedback &amp; Support</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If you send us a request (via a support email or one of our feedback channels), We reserve the right to publish it (stripped of all personally identifying information, of course) in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other Users.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We may provide technical support to service your account(s) with us. In order to do so, we may use certain personally identifying information, with your consent, to access your account for the purpose of troubleshooting, running tests, and/or otherwise providing support. In providing technical support to you, we may potentially see other personally identifying information viewable on your account pages. As with all other information, we promise to hold any information we encounter in the process of providing support to the highest possible security and protection standards.</span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">Security &amp; Data Storage</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">To prevent unauthorized access, safeguard data accuracy, and maintain the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to protect the personal information data you submit. We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems. However, since the Internet is not 100% secure and as new technology evolves and emerges, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party interferences from illegally obtaining or tampering with your personal information.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We encourage you to help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you use the Services. Change your account password often, using a combination of letters, numbers, and characters, and make sure you use a secure connection.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">KickoffLabs will retain data (predominantly anonymized) for as long as needed for the purposes described above and/or as required by law. A user may request access to certain data about themselves by emailing support@kickofflabs.com.</span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">Privacy of Minors</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We do not promote or offer the Services for use by anyone under the age of 17 (“minors”). KickoffLabs does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from minors, and we will not knowingly link to any third-party website or platform, or host any of Your Sites that solicit or collect personal information from minors. If you believe that a minor has disclosed personal information to us or that we have linked to such a third-party or User website or platform, please contact us at support@kickofflabs.com.</span>

</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">KickoffLabs complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.&nbsp;KickoffLabs&nbsp;&nbsp;has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">support@kickofflabs.com</span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">KickoffLabs&nbsp;has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit&nbsp;www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers&nbsp; for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.</span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.&nbsp; See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at&nbsp;https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction</span>
</p>

<p class="p6">
  <span class="s1"><b>Invoking Arbitration</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">An individual who decides to invoke this arbitration option must take the following steps prior to initiating an arbitration claim: (1) raise the claimed violation directly with the organization and afford the organization an opportunity to resolve the issue within the timeframe set forth in Section III.11(d)(i) of the Principles; (2) make use of the independent recourse mechanism under the Principles, which is at no cost to the individual; and (3) raise the issue through their Data Protection Authority to the Department of Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce an opportunity to use best efforts to resolve the issue within the timeframes set forth in the Letter from the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, at no cost to the individual. This arbitration option may not be invoked if the individual’s same claimed violation of the Principles (1) has previously been subject to binding arbitration; (2) was the subject of a final judgment entered in a court action to which the individual was a party; or (3) was previously settled by the parties.</span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">In addition, this option may not be invoked if [an EU Data Protection Authority or the Commissioner]&nbsp;(1) has authority under Sections III.5 or III.9 of the Principles; or (2) has the authority to resolve the claimed violation directly with the organization. [A DPA’s/the Commissioner’s]&nbsp;authority to resolve the same claim against [an EU or a Swiss]&nbsp;data controller does not alone preclude invocation of this arbitration option against a different legal entity not bound by the [DPA/Commissioner’s] authority</span>
</p>

<p class="p4">
  <span class="s1">KickoffLabs Sub-Processors</span>
