This website uses SocialPlugins("Plugins") provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins can be identified by the Facebook logos (white "f" on a blue background or a "thumbs up" icon) or the extension “Facebook Social Plugin” (<http://developers.facebook.com/plugins>).

When a user visits a page of website that contains a social plugin, the browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser which embeds the latter into the website. We accordingly have no influence over the scope of the data that Facebook acquires using this plugin and therefore draw your attention to the information we have available in this respect (<http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=17512>).

The embedded plugins let Facebook know that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, or entering a comment, your browser will send the corresponding information directly to Facebook, at which point it will be saved. If you are not a member of Facebook, Facebook may still acquire and store your IP address. Facebook ensures that, in Germany, the IP address will only be stored anonymously.

For the information on the purpose and scope of data collection and handling by Facebook, as well as your rights in this respect and configuration options regarding the protection of your personal sphere, please visit Facebook's data use policy (<http://www.facebook.com/policy.php>).

If you are a Facebook member and do not want Facebook to collect data concerning your visit to our website and do not want this linked to your Facebook membership data, please log out of Facebook before visiting our website.

A Twitter button enables you to either share a posting or page of this website on Twitter or to follow us on Twitter.

When a user visits a page of website that contains this plugin, the browser establishes a direct connection to Twitter servers. Twitter directly transfers the Twitter button contents to your browser. Thus, we have no influence on the data acquired by Twitter using the plugin and therefore draw your attention to the information we have available in this respect.

When you access a page of the website that contains one of these buttons, your browser establishes a direct connection with Google's servers. The content of the “+1″button is transmitted directly to your browser by Google and incorporated by the browser into the website. We therefore have no influence on the scope of the data that Google collects via this button. According to Google, no personal data is collected unless the user clicks on the button. This data, such as the IP address, is only collected and processed from logged-in members.

The purpose and extent of the data collection and the further handling and usage of the data by Google, as well as the rights and possible settings to protect the privacy of the user, are outlined in Google's privacy policy on the “+1″-button (<http://www.google.com/intl/de/+/policy/+1button.html>) and the FAQ ([http://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=de&answer=1319578&rd=1](http://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=de&answer=1319578&rd=1)).
