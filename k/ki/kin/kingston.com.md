As a parent or guardian you can request Kingston to remove personal information pertaining to your child that was submitted without your consent or by misrepresenting his or her age. At your request, we will take reasonable steps to remove such information from our database.

All such requests should include the same user name, password and e-mail address that your child submitted and should be sent to [sales@kingston.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20170617101457id_/http%3A//www.kingston.com/us/company/sales@kingston.com).

##### WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Kingston takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, users’ information.

Our servers are protected by firewalls and are physically located in secure data facilities to further increase security.

We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for mutual authentication, data encryption and data integrity.

During the online account registration process, you can review, change or remove any information you have submitted. Our goal is to ensure that our information about you is as accurate as possible and encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes. You may, at any time, access your information to update, modify or delete any inaccuracies by accessing your account through the Website.

You may also request that we remove your account information from our databases. We will endeavor to remove as much information as legally allowable. However, as we generally keep information related to past transactions for our records, we may not be able to completely remove all of your information.

##### YOUR RIGHTS

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your information) if we intend to use your information for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes.
