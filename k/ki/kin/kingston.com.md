### What Information Do We Collect?

The information we collect is generally of two types: personally identifiable information (referred to in this Privacy Policy as “PII”, which we have defined above) and non-personally identifiable information.

Non-personally identifiable information comprises information that does not by itself identify an individual. This information generally includes anonymous information about an individual’s use of the website that includes, among other things, information concerning date and time of visit, the pages of the website visited, path through the website, IP address, the type of browser and operating system used.

### How Do We Collect Your Personal Information? And Why?

#### General

Except for the circumstances which we later explain in the following paragraph, we do not collect PII, except when you specifically and knowingly disclose such information. This information is generally collected when you order our products or services, register your products on the website, provide information on a website, web property, or web-based function directly created by or controlled by Kingston, or through any Kingston presence on a social media platform, fill in surveys, take part in promotional events (including competitions), correspond with us, discuss a service issue on the phone with an associate, sign up to receive Kingston product and service updates whether with Kingston or an agent of Kingston, or when we meet with you at meetings or events. If you disclose your PII, we will only store and use such information that we need to meet your requests and our legitimate interests and business objectives, including, where you have consented, providing you with information about products and services that we consider may be of interest to you. We primarily use your PII to perform our contractual obligations to you and fulfil our legal obligations, to run our business efficiently and provide you with an improved and customized online experience and service.

If you have already consented to receiving information about our products and/or services and have viewed the Website after following a link in an email you have received from us, then we may use a targeting cookie to help us better understand which of our products and/or services interest you.

That data concerning your interest in our products and/or services is sent to a third party who notes it against the existing record of your consent to receive marketing communications from us.

#### Product Purchases

When purchasing through the website, we employ a registration process which requires that you provide us with your first and last name, billing and shipping information (which includes your home or other physical address, the name of your city or town, your telephone number, your e-mail address or other PII).

Your personal contact information may be disclosed to our staff and to third parties involved in the completion of your transaction, the delivery of your order or the support of your use of the website.

When you order any product through our website or at a Tradeshow or request an RMA (Returned Merchandise Authorization) on our website, you may be redirected to a third-party payment gateway service to provide your credit card information including the credit card number, card security code (also called CVV2, CVC2, CID code), the expiration date and the billing address. This information is used to perform our contract to supply you with our products or services and for our legitimate interest of collecting payments which may be due to us. The third-party payment gateway service is fully compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for payment processing.

#### Online Surveys

In order to improve our products and services, we may use your PII (including your identity, contact details, and usage data) to send you online surveys.

### Where We Store Your Personal Information

The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, stored in, processed in or accessed from countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).

Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or

Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.

#### EU-U.S. Privacy Shield

Kingston complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of PII from European Union member countries.

### Security

Kingston takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, users’ information. We restrict access to your PII to employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our products, services and the website. Our servers are protected by firewalls and are physically located in secure data facilities to further increase security.

We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for mutual authentication, data encryption and data integrity. While no computer is 100% safe from outside attacks, we believe that the steps we have taken to protect your PII drastically reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of information involved.

### Integrity

During the online account registration process, you can review, change or remove any information you have submitted. Our goal is to ensure that our information about you is as accurate as possible and encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes. You may, at any time, access your information to update, modify or delete any inaccuracies by accessing your account through the website.

### Your Rights

As well as your Right to Object which is set out near the top of this Privacy Policy, you also have the following rights in relation to your PII:

### Right To Access And Right To Rectification

You have the right to know whether your PII is being processed by us, the categories of PII we hold on you, the purposes for which we intend to process your PII, how long we intend to retain your PII and who has received your PII from us (which we may identify as actual recipients or as categories of recipients).

If the PII we hold on you is inaccurate or incomplete, you can amend or delete any inaccuracies by accessing your account through the website, or you can email or phone us to ask that we correct it.

### Right To Erasure

You can ask, by email or phone, for the PII we hold on you (including PII that we’ve passed to anyone else) to be erased if:

  * We no longer require the PII to do what we collected it for; or
  * You have withdrawn your consent for us to use the PII; or
  * We no longer have a legitimate interest in holding or processing your PII; or
  * We have processed your PII unlawfully; or
  * You object to its use for direct marketing purposes and we have no other reason for processing your PII; or
  * The PII we hold was submitted by a person who was under 13 at the time.



Upon receiving a request from you to erase your PII for any of the above reasons, we will endeavour to remove as much information as legally allowable. However, as we generally keep information related to past transactions for the legitimate interest of keeping business records and to fulfil our legal obligations, we may not be able to completely remove all of your information. If we are unable to comply with your request to erase PII we shall tell you in writing what data we have retained, the reasons for retaining it and how long we expect to retain it for.

### Right To Restrict Processing

You can ask us, by email or phone, not to process your PII or to restrict the way it is processed (including PII that we’ve passed to anyone else) if:

  * You do not want us to process your PII whilst we are checking its accuracy; or
  * We have processed your PII without having a lawful basis to do so but you do not want us to erase your PII; or
  * You have objected to us processing your PII for purposes other than direct marketing and we are considering whether we have a lawful basis for continuing to process your PII; or
  * We no longer need your PII but you need us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.



### Right To Data Portability

You have the right to receive PII concerning you, which you have provided, and have the right to transmit that data to another controller. You have the right to have such PII transmitted directly from us to another data controller where technically feasible. We shall supply the PII in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You may contact us about any of your rights by the following means:  
Email: [EU_Compliance@kingston.eu](mailto:EU_Compliance@kingston.eu)  
Phone: [https://www.kingston.com/en/support](https://web.archive.org/en/support)

If you believe that we have failed to process your PII in accordance with your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation, and after informing us we have failed to address your concerns, then you may lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority of the EU member country where you live, where you work or where the alleged infringement of your rights occurred. You also have the right to take legal action against us or anyone that we have passed your PII to if you believe that we (or the party that we have passed your PII to) have failed to process your PII according to your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation. Such legal action may be taken either in the courts of the EU member country where you live, or where we (or the party that we have passed your PII to) are established.
