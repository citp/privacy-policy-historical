**Information About What Kinesis Survey Technologies LLC Gathers and Tracks  
**Kinesis Survey Technologies LLC collects two kinds of information about users: 1) data that users volunteer by signing up to receive news and product information, entering contests, completing surveys, or buying directly from us; and 2) aggregated tracking data we collect when users interact with us.
