##  1\. OUR APPROACH

KC takes the privacy of its users seriously. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself (including your email address). When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.

If we decide to change our privacy policy for this website, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.

##  2\. INFORMATION COLLECTION

We collect personal information (such as your name, email address and any other details you provide to us that identifies you as an individual) from you when you submit a request for information or when you submit your details for any other reason. Personal information will only be collected with your consent.

When you browse our website, we may also log your IP address (the internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend here. We do not link your IP address to any other personal information that you send to us. Like many other websites, we may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the website (see section 6\. Cookies)

Save for the use of cookies, we do not automatically log data or collect data apart from information you specifically provide to us.

##  3\. USE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We (and other KCOM Group companies) will use your information for several general purposes including: fulfilling any requests for information or services placed by you, processing any other transactions authorised by you, keeping you up to date with news about KCOM Group, our products and services, and providing other information to you which we think you may find of interest. Your personal information shall not be used for any other purposes.

##  4\. WHO MAY PROCESS DATA

Your personal information may be processed both by us and by other companies within our Group in accordance with this privacy policy.

Where any personal information is processed by us, we will comply with relevant Data Protection legislation at all times. We are registered to process data under the Data Protection Act (our registration number is D1303069) and you may refer to the Data Protection Register website for further information at [http://www.dpr.gov.uk](http://www.dpr.gov.uk/).

##  5\. SECURITY MEASURES

We are serious about guarding the security of your personal information that we have under our control from unauthorised access, improper use and disclosure, unauthorised destruction or accidental loss. However we cannot guarantee the protection of your personal data as due to the nature of the Internet, the Website is theoretically accessible by any user of the World Wide Web. You should be aware that when you disclose personal information on the Website it may be collected by another user and may result in unsolicited messages from other Internet users.
