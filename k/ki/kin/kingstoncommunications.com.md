## 1\. OUR APPROACH

KC takes privacy seriously. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself (including your email address). When we do need your personal data to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal data whether in connection with a contract with us for services or otherwise through your interaction with us, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal data.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.

## 6\. COOKIES

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie.

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

If you choose to disclose personal information about yourself to us, we will use a cookie containing encrypted information to enable us to uniquely identify you. Each time you visit the website a cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed on your browser. These cookies allow us to uniquely identify you when you visit the website and in order to enable us to provide you with a personal browsing experience. There are two types of cookies.  These are:

  1. A "session cookie", which expires immediately when you end your browsing session (for example, by closing your browser); or
  2. A "persistent cookie", which stores information on your hard drive for use of the cookie information at a later date. This means that when you end your browsing session the cookie information is not lost, and when you next return to the website, the cookie information is retrieved and used by the website.



When you visit our website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie.  Some cookies may contain information (such as the unique identity assigned by the cookie to identify you) that is used to track your usage of our website.  We use cookies to enable our systems to recognise our website users, to tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people.  We also use cookies in order for our systems to recognise you as a return visitor by the unique identity assigned by the cookie to identify you. This cookie is readable only by us. Cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on your computer.

You can find out more information about cookies and the cookies we use in our [Cookie Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/cookie-use-policy/ "Cookie Use Policy").

At your request, we will use reasonable efforts to update / correct personal data previously submitted by you. You may also request that we cease processing the personal data we have about you and that we delete your personal data from our database or records. However, it may be impossible to delete your information without some residual information because of backups and records of deletions.

Please address your requests to change or delete your personal data to [info@kcom.com](mailto:info@kcom.com "info@kcom.com") and insert "change details" or "unsubscribe" as appropriate as the subject heading. Alternatively you may write to us at the KCOM Group Address, stating your name and email address for identification purposes.
