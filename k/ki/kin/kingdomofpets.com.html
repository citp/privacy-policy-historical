  <h2>Privacy Policy:</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>General</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your use of this website is governed by our Terms of Use.  Accordingly, this Privacy Policy must be read in conjunction with our Terms of  Use.<br>
    Information Collection and Use</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>KINGDOM OF PETS Ltd. is the sole owner of any information  collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to  others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. KINGDOM OF  PETS Ltd. collects information from our users at several different points on  our website. We stress that all personal information is always treated as  personal and confidential, unless specifically stated otherwise.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>An example of this is that when you sign up to a KINGDOM OF PETS  newsletter series (6 Day Courses or free trials) your email address is only  recorded so that we can send you KINGDOM   OF PETS newsletters  and/or free trial.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if  you no longer desire our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct,  update or remove the personal data you provided to us. This can be done by  clicking the “change subscription options” link at the bottom of any email from  us or by sending us an email.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Success Stories and Reviews</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We only use names, photos and testimonials or reviews of  people who have given us permission to do so. If you have feedback about any KINGDOM OF PETS product then please email us.  Please state whether or not we are allowed to use your feedback as a  testimonial.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Log Files</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Links</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware  that KINGDOM OF PETS Ltd. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such  other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to  read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally  identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information  collected by this Website.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This website takes certain precautions to protect our users’  information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your  information is protected both online and off-line. However, there is  unfortunately no way yet for the industry to guarantee that the information you  transmit through the Internet is entirely secure.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Notice to Parents</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This website is not specifically directed at or intended for  children. Our public forums, such as the chat rooms and message boards, are  considered non-confidential communications. Much of the content in these public  areas, including the content within specific messages, comments or postings is  provided by and is the responsibility of the third party creator of the  communication or the person posting the information. The Company does not  control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any public forum  and, therefore, the Company specifically disclaims any liability with regard to  public forums and any actions resulting from a user’s participation in any  public forum. The Company has no responsibility for such content and is merely  providing access to such content as a service to its users.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The best way for you as a parent to protect your child’s  online privacy and safety is through supervision and parental guidance. Visit  the sites that your child uses. Good communication with the child will help him/her  be more aware of the risks involved in providing strangers with personal  information, especially when using chat-rooms or e-mail. We strongly recommend  that you supervise your children’s activities when using these services as you  would in any public area.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For your information, as a parent or legal guardian of a  child under 13 years old, you have the right to review your child’s personal  information gathered by Internet sites. You may ask to have your child’s  information deleted from their records and refuse to allow any further  collection or use of your child’s information. KINGDOM OF PETS Ltd. does not  collect information from registrants who indicate to be under 13 years old.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes  via the Privacy Policy links on the website so our users are aware of what  information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we  disclose it.</p>
