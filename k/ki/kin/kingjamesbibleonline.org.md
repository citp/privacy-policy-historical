# PRIVACY POLICY

#### How We Protect Your Privacy

We use security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system. 

#### Sharing and Usage

We will not share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you.

We may at times use services from third party vendors, including Google, that use coookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website.

Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.

Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative [opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

#### Will I be automatically added to an email subscription list?

No. No one is added to any list without authorization. We have a NO-SPAM rule with zero tolerance for spam. No spam has ever been sent or will ever be sent, and none is permitted to be received. It is against our policies to falsify and report emails as spam that are not spam.

You may actively choose to subscribe to Bible comment threads. At times, this may trigger an email notification to be sent to subscribers if someone updates a comment on the subscribed thread. A Bible-in-a-Year reading program is also available via email for subscribers. Interested parties subscribe themselves, by entering their email and clicking the subscribe button, and remove themselves from clicking a single link at the bottom of any one of the daily emails. This is a free service and contains no commercial solicitations- only Bible scripture. 

If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email you believe has been sent from our website domain, please use this web form to [Contact Us](http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Contact_Us.php).

#### Privacy Policy History

This policy is effective as of November 2007.
