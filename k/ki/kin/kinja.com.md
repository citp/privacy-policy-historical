### Information Collection and Use

##### Information Collection

Kinja, LLC. is the sole owner of the information collected on www.kinja.com. Kinja collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

##### Registration

In order to use fully this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user gives contact information (such as name and email address) and unique identifiers (such as, username and password). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site about which she has expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as date of birth), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 

##### Information Use

Kinja provides personalized digests of content from weblogs and news sites. The site uses username and password to identify users, in order to display the correct personal digest. Kinja also aggregates data to identify patterns, such as the most popular news sources in the system, or to categorize sites. Kinja monitors the sites selected by users in order to provide more complete topic digests. 

##### Profile

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. Your profile is shared in aggregate form only, except where explicitly indicated. 

##### Public digests

The user's profile contains a list of blogs and other web addresses, in order to provide personal digests. Personal digests are, by default, public, and available at www.kinja.com/user/<username>/<digestname>. To make personal digests private, the user must go to the "Share" page in the "Favorites" section, and check a box indicating "Keep my page private". Kinja's editors may monitor a user's public digests in order to improve the topic digests which are available to all users. 

##### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file [directions](http://www.sabcar.unr.edu/howto/explorer/). 

By setting a cookie on our site, users will not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. We store a cookie on each user's machine that contains a username and encrypted password. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Kinja products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, not all Kinja services require that you accept cookies. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile" section above. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, Kinja has no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Kinja only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

### Third Party Advertising

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by various advertising networks. Information about users' visit to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not username, date of birth, or any other personal information), may be used to serve ads to users on this site. 

### Log Files

Like most Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement. 

### Communications from the Site

##### Special Offers and Updates

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify the email address used to create the account. Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' to receive news of Kinja developments via email. Users who no longer wish to receive our communications may change their preferences on the user profile page. 

##### Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are never promotional in nature. 

### Sharing

##### Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

##### Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

We may in future share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers upon request. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 

##### Third Party Advertisers

Kinja may in future share Web site usage information about users with a reputable third party for the purpose of targeting our advertisements on this site and other sites. 

### Business Transitions

In the event Kinja goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. 

### Links

The Kinja web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Kinja, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Kinja. 

Kinja may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a "URL redirecter. " When Kinja uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL from a search result, information about the click is sent to Kinja, and Kinja in turn sends you to the site you clicked on. Kinja uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of our personalization. 

### Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

### Editing Personal Information

You can edit your Kinja account information at any time by visiting your [Kinja profile page](https://web.archive.org/editprofileform.knj "Kinja profile page"). You can delete your Kinja account at any time by visiting our Account Deletion page.

### Notification of Changes

Whenever we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the Kinja weblog, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
