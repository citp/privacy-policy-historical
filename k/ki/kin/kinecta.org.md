Why?          Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
              consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we
              collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand
              what we do.
What?         The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have

              • Social Security number and Income
              • Account Balances and Account Transactions
              • Transaction History and Risk Tolerance

              business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their members’
              personal information; the reasons Kinecta Federal Credit Union chooses to share; and whether you
              can limit this sharing.
