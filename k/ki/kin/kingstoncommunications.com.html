<h2><a name="Our_approach"></a>1. OUR APPROACH</h2>
<p>KC takes privacy seriously. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself (including your email address). When we do need your personal data to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal data whether in connection with a contract with us for services or otherwise through your interaction with us, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal data.</p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.</p>
<p><a href="#top">&gt;back to top</a></p>
<h2><a name="Information_collection"></a>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION</h2>
<p>We collect personal data (such as your name, email address and any other details you provide to us that identifies you as an individual) from you when you submit a request for information, or in connection with us providing services to you, or when you submit your details for any other reason. Personal data will only be collected with your consent and in accordance with the terms and conditions of any contract you enter into with us.</p>
<p>In relation to your use of our website, we collect personal information from you in order to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience whilst browsing our website.</p>
<p>When you browse our website, we may also log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend here. Like many other websites, we may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the website (see section <a href="#Cookies">6. Cookies</a>)</p>
<p>Save for the use of cookies, we do not automatically log data or collect data apart from information you specifically provide to us or which we receive as part of the provision of services to you (such as data automatically stored on our systems and infrastructure through your use of a service).</p>
<p><a href="#top">&gt;back to top</a></p>
<h2><a name="Use_of_information_we_collect"></a>3. USE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p>We (and other KCOM Group companies and selected third parties processing data on our or our group companies’ behalf) will use your personal data and other information for several general purposes including: supplying services to you and administering contracts with you, fulfilling any requests for information or services placed by you or your authorised contacts/persons, processing any other transactions or requests authorised by you or your authorised contacts/persons, keeping you up to date with news about KCOM Group, our products and services, &nbsp;providing other information to you which we think you may find of interest, and for any other purposes set out in any contract you have with us for services.</p>
<p><a href="#top">&gt;back to top</a></p>
<h2><a name="Who_may_process_data"></a>4. WHO MAY PROCESS DATA</h2>
<p>Your personal data may be processed by us, by other companies within our group and by selected third parties processing data on our or our group companies’ behalf in accordance with this privacy policy. Such processing may include processing and transferring data outside the European Economic Area. Personal data will not be sold or transferred to other unaffiliated third parties without your prior consent.</p>
<p>Where any personal data is processed by us, we will comply with relevant Data Protection legislation at all times. We are registered to process data under the Data Protection Act (our registration number is D1303069) and you may refer to the Data Protection Register website for further information at <a href="http://www.dpr.gov.uk/" title="http://www.dpr.gov.uk/">http://www.dpr.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Security_measures"></a>5. SECURITY MEASURES</h2>
<p>We are serious about guarding the security of your personal data that we have under our control from unauthorised access, improper use and disclosure, unauthorised destruction or accidental loss. However we cannot guarantee the protection of your personal data in relation to use of our website as, due to the nature of the Internet, the website is theoretically accessible by any user of the World Wide Web. You should be aware that when you disclose personal data on the website it may be collected by another user and may result in unsolicited messages from other Internet users.</p>

<h2><a name="Cookies"></a>6. COOKIES</h2>
<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie.</p>
<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
<p>If you choose to disclose personal information about yourself to us, we will use a cookie containing encrypted information to enable us to uniquely identify you. Each time you visit the website a cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed on your browser. These cookies allow us to uniquely identify you when you visit the website and in order to enable us to provide you with a personal browsing experience. There are two types of cookies. &nbsp;These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A "session cookie", which expires immediately when you end your browsing session (for example, by closing your browser); or</li>
<li>A "persistent cookie", which stores information on your hard drive for use of the cookie information at a later date. This means that when you end your browsing session the cookie information is not lost, and when you next return to the website, the cookie information is retrieved and used by the website.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you visit our website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. &nbsp;Some cookies may contain information (such as the unique identity assigned by the cookie to identify you) that is used to track your usage of our website. &nbsp;We use cookies to enable our systems to recognise our website users, to tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. &nbsp;We also use cookies in order for our systems to recognise you as a return visitor by the unique identity assigned by the cookie to identify you. This cookie is readable only by us. Cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on your computer.</p>
<p>You can find out more information about cookies and the cookies we use in our <a href="/legal/cookie-use-policy/" target="_self" title="Cookie Use Policy">Cookie Use Policy</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Access_and_changes_to_your_personal_information"></a>7. ACCESS AND CHANGES TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Upon request, we may provide you with a copy of the personal information which we hold about you (in return for a small fee). Please address requests to<a href="mailto:datacomplianceofficer@kcom.com" title="datacomplianceofficer@kcom.com">datacomplianceofficer@kcom.com</a> and insert "access request" as the subject heading, or write to us at the KCOM Group Address, stating your name and email address for identification purposes.</p>
<p>At your request, we will use reasonable efforts to update / correct personal data previously submitted by you. You may also request that we cease processing the personal data we have about you and that we delete your personal data from our database or records. However, it may be impossible to delete your information without some residual information because of backups and records of deletions.</p>
<p>Please address your requests to change or delete your personal data to <a href="mailto:info@kcom.com" title="info@kcom.com">info@kcom.com</a> and insert "change details" or "unsubscribe" as appropriate as the subject heading.
