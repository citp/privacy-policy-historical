<h3>Last modified April 29, 2012</h3>

<p>Koyote-Lab, Inc. ("KingTranslate") takes your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn
    more about King Translate's Privacy Policy ("Policy"). This Policy details how KingTranslate receives,
    collects and uses information in connection with its Website located at <a href="/">www.KingTranslate.com</a>.

</p><p>Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms shall have the same meaning ascribed
    to them in the Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>

<p><strong>Information You Provide:</strong></p>

<p>You can use the Website and access the Software and Service without providing any Personal
    Information (defined below). However, in connection with other activities through the Website, you
    may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information, which may include your name,
    email address, age, gender, address, telephone number(s), areas of interest, login name, login password
    and other self-identifying information (all "Personal Information"). It is entirely optional for you to
    engage in these activities. KingTranslate collects this Personal Information primarily for the following
    purposes: (i) personalize your experience of the Service; (ii) to manage and maintain users' personal
    preferences; and (iii) to email you with news, updates and offers. If you no longer wish to receive
    communication from KingTranslate, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in any of
    those communications (or see section below on Change or Removal of Information).</p>

<p><strong>Information We Automatically Collect:</strong></p>

<p>KingTranslate does not automatically collect any Personal Information on or through the Website,
    except as may be provided by you in connection with your voluntary communications described
    above. However, when you use the Website, KingTranslate may also automatically collect certain
    information about your computer to facilitate, evaluate and verify your use of the Website. For
    example, KingTranslate may use "cookies," "web beacons" and similar devices to track your activities
    on the Website. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive
    for record-keeping purposes. A web-beacon is a small transparent gif image that is embedded in an
    HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. Cookies make web-surfing
    easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are on the Website. Cookies may be used
    to analyze Website usage, improve content, customize the Website's content and layout and for other
    customer service purposes. KingTranslate's use of cookies or similar devices is not linked to any Personal
    Information.</p>

<p>When you visit the Website, KingTranslate may automatically receive and record certain non-personally
    identifiable information on its server logs from your browser, including your IP address, browser type,
    internet service provider (ISP), cookie information, and the webpage that you visit. KingTranslate
    collects non-personally identifiable information for general purposes, including but not limited to
    analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking user movements, conducting research, and providing
    anonymous reporting to internal and external clients. KingTranslate will not link any Personal
    Information, including e-mail addresses, with the aggregate data of its users. Please be aware that some
    non-personally identifiable information such as Uniform Resource Locators ("URL's) or Internet Protocol
    ("IP") addresses could become Personal Information when combined by third parties with the ISP's
    records. KingTranslate does NOT do this with your information.</p>

<h2>Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>

<p>KingTranslate does not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties without
    your permission. KingTranslate may disclose your information if KingTranslate believes such action is
    necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on KingTranslate; (b) protect and defend
    the rights or property of KingTranslate (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in
    urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of KingTranslate services or members of
    the public. KingTranslate may share aggregated non-personally identifiable demographic information
    about users with third party advertising and content companies. This information does not identify
    individual users and KingTranslate does not link aggregate user data with Personal Information.</p>

<p>KingTranslate may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help it provide, analyze
    and improve the Website, Software and Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance
    services, database management, web analytics, information processing and improvement of the
    Website's features and services. These third parties may have access to your information only for
    purposes of performing these tasks on behalf of KingTranslate and under obligations similar to those in
    this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Third party advertisers and websites</h2>

<p>KingTranslate does not actively share Personal Information with third party advertisers for their direct
    marketing purposes unless you give KingTranslate your consent. Advertisers, however, may obtain
    public information about you from your user profile and other public sources. Remember, third parties
    will have access to your Personal Information if you provide it to them. For example, if you want to
    buy offers, goods or services from through third party advertisers on the Website, the transaction
    may be facilitated on the third party's website. You will then have to provide the third party with the
    information required (such as for example name, shipping address, credit card info etc), which will
    them be subject to their specific privacy policies. If you access another website or promotion and/
    or service through a website operated by any entity other than KingTranslate, that site is referred
    to as a "Third Party Site". Unless KingTranslate clearly indicates otherwise at the time of collection,
    KingTranslate does not share Personal Information with Third Party Sites. Please be aware however
    that these Third Party Sites may collect information about you. Please see the Third Party Site's privacy
    policy to better understand what information is collected, how it is used and shared, and your choices
    regarding control. KingTranslate has no control over these linked Third Party Sites, each of which has
    a separate privacy and data collection practice, independent of this Privacy Policy. KingTranslate does
    not monitor, control, or endorse the information collection or privacy practices of any Third Party Site.
    As such, KingTranslate is not responsible for, or have control over, the content or the privacy policies of
    these Third Party Sites. You must read the privacy policies of each and every website that you visit when
    linking from the Website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by KingTranslate.</p>

    Privacy Policy. By using the Website and Service, you represent and warrant you are of adult age in

<p>KingTranslate takes reasonable precaution to protect your information from misuse, loss and
    unauthorized access. Although KingTranslate cannot guarantee that your information will not be subject
    to unauthorized access, KingTranslate has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect
    the your information. Your information is protected by secured networks and access is limited to a
    few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or

    be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by
    these methods in transit.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that KingTranslate believes that the security of your Personal Information in
    our possession or control may have been compromised, KingTranslate may seek to notify you
    that development if you have provided KingTranslate with your email address or other method
    communicating with you. If a notification is appropriate, KingTranslate will endeavor to do so
    promptly as possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p>IF YOU ARE A USER ACCESSING THE WEBSITE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, ASIA, OR ANY OTHER
    REGION WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION, USE, AND
    DISCLOSURE THAT DIFFER FROM UNITED STATES LAWS, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THROUGH
    YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES, WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY UNITED STATES LAW, THIS
    PRIVACY POLICY, AND KINGTRANSLATE' TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL
    INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND YOU CONSENT TO THAT TRANSFER. ADDITIONALLY, YOU
    UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO AND PROCESSED IN
    COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING PERSONAL
    INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN IN YOUR COUNTRY.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>KingTranslate will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services and fulfill the
    purposes outlined in this Policy. KingTranslate may retain and use your information as necessary to
    comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these
    requirements, KingTranslate will try to delete your information quickly and upon request.</p>

<h2>Business Transitions</h2>

<p>In the event that KingTranslate goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by
    another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Personal Information will likely be among the
    assets transferred. KingTranslate will post a notice on this Website of any such change in ownership or
    control of the Personal Information KingTranslate may have prior to such transfer.</p>

<h2>Changes to Policy</h2>

<p>From time to time, KingTranslate may revise this Policy. KingTranslate will post the revised Policy on
    the Website, so that users can always be aware of what information KingTranslate collects, how the
    information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed. If KingTranslate
    makes a change in its data collection policy that would result in a materially more permissive use of
    your Personal Information, KingTranslate will obtain your prior affirmative consent before implementing
    the change with respect to your data if we have your contact information or we will provide more
    prominent notice. You should also visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy
    Notice.</p>

<p>If you have provided KingTranslate with Personal Information, you can review, update, correct, edit or
    delete your Personal Information at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@kingtranslate.com">info@KingTranslate.com</a>.</p>
