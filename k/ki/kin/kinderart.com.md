**Children's Privacy**  
This statement discloses the privacy practices for portions of KinderArt directed at children under 13. 

**KinderArt will NOT:**

  * Collect personally identifiable offline contact information from users under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. 
  * Distribute to any personally identifiable information collected from a child under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. 



KinderArt places prominent notices wherever personally identifiable information is collected requesting the child to ask a parent for permission to proceed.
