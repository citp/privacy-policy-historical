## Privacy policy

**What information do we collect?**

Kineo Limited (we or our or us) will be the ‘controller’ of the personal data you provide to us. We only collect basic personal data about you and this does not include any special types of information, nor specific location - except for your postal address, if you provide it.

The information we collect about you through this site is limited to that entered on any form. This may include your name, place of work, building address, email address, telephone number and other contact details.

**Why we need this information**

We need to know your basic personal data to provide the services or information requested - this may be about our products, for upcoming events, on product and service updates or changes, or to provide a response to specific questions asked.

We may also use anonymous aggregate information, cookie data and statistics to help monitor site performance and usage, to make the site operate correctly and to help plan improvements. Some of this anonymous information may be passed to the third parties who work with us to maintain the site.

**Processing your data**

All the personal data we process is handled by our staff in the UK and is located on servers in the UK. No third parties have access to your personal data unless the law allows them to do so. Kineo processes your data within the framework of our Electronic Information Security Policy and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance documents – copies of which can be downloaded from this site.

**Keeping your data**

We keep your personal data for marketing and other purposes related to the reason for your initial contact, until you notify us that you no longer wish to receive these communications. You may unsubscribe at any time by contacting us at info@kineo.com or by using the ‘unsubscribe’ link at the foot of any marketing email we send. You can also unsubscribe by contacting the main Kineo office by phone or letter. Contact us for details.

Email info@kineo.com.

If you are not satisfied with our response, or believe our processing of your personal data is not in compliance with the law, you can complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).
