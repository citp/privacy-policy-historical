# About Kindsafe.com

Kindsafe's mission is to search for websites which might be potentially harmful to family safety. A non-safe content specification may include writing or promoting adult content, hazard, violence, or another type of content that may, for example, cause damage to your computer (warez). 

## How do we check for bad content?

Our company has developed own algorithms which regularly crawl a large number of domains, and check for bad content (keywords, links to bad neighbors and so on). If we find out that a significant part of the page is related to unsafe content, we mark that site as non-family safe. 

## Why do we do it?

Because we have children and we have encountered a huge lot of websites we definitelly do not want our children to visit. 

## How can I help?

It's easy. Submit your reviews for a website you know - this will help us to make a better image of every website we display information about. Install our plugin for marking websites, or use our API and mention us on your website.
