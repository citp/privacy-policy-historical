# Privacy and the King County Website

### Preface

King County, as a government entity, conducts public business and its records related to the business of King County are generally available for public review. Nevertheless, King County is committed, to the extent allowable by law, to protect and secure your personal information contained in King County records. This privacy commitment must be balanced with the rights of public access under [Chapter 42.56 RCW](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56) (Washington Public Disclosure Act) and consistent with [KCC 2.14.030](https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061010id_/http%3A//www.kingcounty.gov/About/~/media/Council/documents/Clerk/CodeFiles/05_Title_2.ashx) (1.4MB DOC; scroll down to 2.14.030) and any other applicable federal, state, and local statute or regulation.

### Information privacy

King County gathers personal information when it is relevant and necessary, fair and to the extent possible with the knowledge and consent of the individual, to accomplish county business. We only obtain this information through legal means. When King County collects personal information from you, we:

  * Tell you why we are collecting this personal information. 
  * Limit the amount of your personal information that we collect to that which is necessary for the stated purpose for which it was collected. 
  * Take steps to use your personal information to the stated purpose for which it was collected. 
  * Take steps to ensure that, at the time of collection, your personal information is accurate, complete and current. 
  * Provide your personal information only to authorized King County employees and private contractors or public organizations on a need-to-know basis and as a result of a public disclosure request as required by the Public Records Act. 
  * Do not sell or make your personal information available to others without your consent   
except when:
    * Legally required or permitted by law; or 
    * Needed to complete your transaction with the county. 
  * Retain personal information only as long as necessary to conduct county business in accordance with records retention schedules. 
  * Dispose of personal information in a secure manner that prevents unauthorized disclosure. 
  * Take organizational, technological, and physical measures to securely safeguard personal information.
