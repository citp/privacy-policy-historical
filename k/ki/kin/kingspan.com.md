#### Marketing

We would like to provide you with information about Kingspan’s products and services, and other information from Kingspan, which we think you may find interesting. We may send you such information by post, email, and/or telephone if you agree we can or unless you have asked us not to do so (see below).

We do not provide your personal information to external organisations (i.e. to merchants, distributors and retailers, which are outside of Kingspan) for their own direct marketing or other purposes without your explicit consent. 

If at any time you do not want your information used for direct marketing purposes by a Kingspan company, please contact the relevant Kingspan company from which you have received marketing so that they can unsubscribe you from their marketing lists. If you have received email marketing from a Kingspan company and decide that you no longer wish to receive marketing emails from them, you will usually also be able to opt out of receiving further email marketing from them by following an unsubscribe link in the email, or by such other means as we may communicate to you.  Please note that as we do not as a group operate a global marketing database which means we are unable to unsubscribe you from marketing from all Kingspan companies centrally.

#### Who do we share this information with? 

As well as Kingspan Holdings (Ireland) Limited  (the Kingspan website operator) your personal information may be processed by the relevant affiliate of Kingspan Holdings (Ireland) Limited that owns the part of the website which you are accessing.  Thus, we may disclose your personal information to affiliates of Kingspan Holdings (Ireland) Limited or (if you have so permitted) third parties located in countries other than your own.   [Click here to access a list of those affiliates of Kingspan Holdings (Ireland) Limited.](https://www.kingspan.com/group/data-controllers)  Please bear in mind that the countries to which your personal data is sent/accessed from may have a different standard of data protection than the country in which you are situated. However, we have put in place protections to ensure that your information is safeguarded.

Where organisations outside of Kingspan provide you with a service on our behalf (e.g. sending you a piece of literature that you have requested from us), we may share your personal information with those organisations who will only use the information to provide the relevant service. However, we will retain control of your personal information and any third party service provider that we use must act in accordance with our instructions. We may also share your personal information with a purchaser or potential purchaser of our business.

In some circumstances, we may have to disclose your personal information by law, because a court or the police or other law enforcement agency has asked us for it.

#### Retention of your information 

We only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for us to use your personal information as described above or to comply with our legal obligations.

Where your personal information is processed with your consent (e.g. for the marketing purposes), such personal information is retained until you revoke the consent for such processing.

#### Your rights, how to get copies of or amend the information we have collected and how make a  complaint.

You may request details of the personal information that we hold about you under data protection laws. If you would like a copy of the information held about you please make your request to the relevant Kingspan company. If you think any information held by a Kingspan company about you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to the Kingspan company as soon as possible and they will delete, block, correct or update any information as soon as they can.

If you wish to make a complaint about an alleged breach of the law, we ask that you send us your complaint in writing to [admin@kingspan.](mailto:admin@kingspan.ie)[com](mailto:admin@kingspan.com).  We endeavour to respond to complaints within a reasonable period (usually 30 days).
