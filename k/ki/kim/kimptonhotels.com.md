# Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants - Privacy Statement

| 

Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group, LLC respects your privacy. The information that you provide to us will be used to send you information about Kimpton, such as discounted rate offerings, new hotel openings and special programs. If you choose to book a reservation or create a customer profile online, your personal information will be used to make and confirm your reservation and to customize and enhance your visit to any Kimpton Hotel in the future. Your personal information will not be used for any other purpose, unless explicitly stated at the time of the request. Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group, LLC does not sell your personal information to third parties. Every email communication from Kimpton, excepting reservation confirmations and the like, will contain clear and obvious instructions for how you can remove yourself from that mailing list ("Opt-out"). You may also unsubscribe at any time by completing our subscription preferences form at [ http://kimptongroup.ip02.com/kimptongroup/prefs](http://kimptongroup.ip02.com/kimptongroup/prefs).  
**Information Collection and Use**  
Demographic and profile data is collected at our site and we use this data in two main ways. First, we analyze visitor information in aggregate - that is, we collect information about thousands of site visits and analyze it as a whole. This kind of study involves looking for trends among many visitors to our site, rather than analyzing information about any individual visitor. Examples include researching which parts of the site are accessed most frequently or determining which products are most attractive to our users. Second, we may use information you provide to help us customize our communications with you and improve our service to you when you stay at any of the Kimpton Hotels. For instance, if you inform us of a room or service preference, we will attempt to satisfy that request when you visit us in the future. We use third parties to build and manage these communication and preference systems, and our arrangements with these third parties prohibit them from disclosing your personal information.

Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group, LLC may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our site traffic and to establish advertising and other business relationships with third parties. Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group, LLC does not provide any of your personal information to any third party advertiser.  
**Third Party Internet Sites**  
Third party Internet sites available through advertising and other links on our site have separate privacy and data collection practices. We have no responsibility or liability for these third party policies or actions. Please refer to the privacy statement of any applicable third party site when providing personally identifiable information.  
**The Security of Your Information**  
We work diligently to protect the security of your personal information, including credit card information, during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. Your data is kept in a highly secure environment protected from access by unauthorized parties. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your customer profile by ensuring that you logoff when you have finished visiting our site.  
**Cookies**  
Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file on your computer's hard drive when you visit our site. We use cookies to improve your experience, for instance, by allowing you to login without typing the registered email address or registration number and password. We also use them to deliver information and fresh content specific to your interests. Cookies are widely used on most major sites.

We may use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or Web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.  
**Browser Monitor**  
We may employ a browser monitor within Web pages on our site in order to determine your browser status and the client-side metrics relating to page loading. We constantly seek ways to improve page load times for our visitors and may ultimately use these metrics for such purposes. Any such browser monitor will only be active while the user is active on our site. For your protection, any such browser monitor will not require an executable (*.exe) application.  
**IP Address**  
Like most Internet sites, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information.  
**Children**  
Protecting the privacy of the young is especially important to us. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our site is intended for use by those under 13.  
**Use of WebTrends Reporting Service**  
WebTrends Reporting Service is used to analyze traffic to this web site. WebTrends Reporting Service does not create individual profiles for visitors. Unlike some tracking services, WebTrends Reporting Service does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. WebTrends Reporting Service only collects aggregate data. You should refer to the WebTrends Reporting Service Privacy Policy to learn how they collect and use information. You can find the WebTrends Reporting Service Privacy Policy here: <http://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp>  
**Updates to our Information Practices**  
From time to time, we make changes to our information practices or alter the functionality of our Web site. We always update this statement accordingly, so we encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.  
**Abuse of Terms of Service**  
We may provide your personal information to the police or other investigating agencies to assist them in the investigation of any suspected violations of law. We also reserve the right to share your name and contact information with our attorneys in the event of serious violations of conduct.  
**Contact Us**  
If you have any questions about our privacy policies or any other matter, please contact us at [privacypolicy@kimptongroup.com](mailto:privacypolicy@kimptongroup.com).
