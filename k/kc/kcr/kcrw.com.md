# Privacy Policy - KCRW

At KCRW Online, we recognize the importance of privacy to visitors of our Web site. This privacy policy explains what type of information is collected from you when you visit our Web site and how that information may be used. 

  
**Gathering of Information**  
KCRW collects personally-identifying information (such as your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number and/or credit card information) from the KCRW Web site only if you choose to provide that information to us.

KCRW asks visitors to provide certain personal information when they request a transcript and/or audio CD of KCRW programs, when they e-mail a page of the KCRW Web site to another person, when they subscribe to KCRW, and when they register for any online contests/giveaways. KCRW also may ask visitors to provide personal information in other limited circumstances specified at the time the information is gathered.

Like all other Web servers, KCRW's Web server automatically creates log files for each visitor who accesses our site. These "access logs" allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do NOT record a visitor's name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information. Rather, they contain some or all of the following information: 

> • The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine which accessed our Web site.  
>  • The date of the visit.  
>  • The time of the visit.  
>  • The path taken through our Web site.  
>  • The type of computer and browser being used.  
>  • A list of files downloaded or viewed.  
>  • The amount of time spent listening to RealAudio, Windows Media or Quicktime files.  
>  • Any errors encountered. 

**Cookies**  
KCRW also uses 'cookies' to collect information. A cookie is a string of characters that can be written to a file on the user's hard drive when the user visits a Web site. Only the Web site that set the cookie can read it, and it can only be used as a record keeping device to store information that the site already has. It cannot, for example, be used to read other information from the user's hard drive.

KCRW uses cookies to track users' activity through the site in order to improve the site's architecture, to offer the user interactive features that would not be possible without them, and to recall specific information to save the user time during subsequent visits to the site. For example, cookies allow KCRW to remember your media player (e.g., Real Audio or Windows Media) preference. Local station customization and other interactive features also use cookies. Our sponsorship service vendors, which serve sponsorship messages onto our site, and vendors that measure the use of KCRW.org, may also use their own cookies. If you wish to prevent certain or all cookies from being set to your hard drive you may disable them in your browser's preferences, although your browser might then be unable to accommodate certain functionalities on KCRW.org.

 **Use of Information**  
The use of personally-identifying information is limited to the following: responding to user e-mails; listing name and location (city, state and/or country) information provided by users when publishing user e-mails or other submissions; fulfillment of transcript and/or audio CD orders; fulfillment of subscriptions; contest management; editorial purposes such as contacting users for an online survey; sending communications, including marketing and promotional communications, from KCRW or KCRW member stations to users who have 'opted in' to the receipt of such communications; other internal KCRW or KCRW member station purposes; and other purposes specified at the time the information is gathered.

In addition, if you send an e-mail, story idea, essay and/or other submission ("Submission") to KCRW through our Web site, we may print that Submission, or an excerpt from it, on the KCRW Web site, read it on air, or otherwise publish it in any other medium, together with your name and location (city, state and/or country) if you provide that information to us.

Personally-identifying information collected by KCRW is not provided to outside parties, KCRW service vendors (such as KCRW's transcript and audio CD fulfillment service, and KCRW's email list manager), and other third parties when the user specifically consents to such distribution. In these circumstances, the information is provided for the sole purpose of -- and only to the extent necessary for -- delivering the requested transcript, audio CD, or goods to the user, delivering communications from KCRW or KCRW member stations to users who have 'opted in' to the receipt of these communications, or serving other internal KCRW or KCRW member station purposes.

KCRW also may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if it believes that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the KCRW Web site, or (c) protect the personal safety or property of KCRW Web site users, the public or KCRW and its employees.

If you do not want your personally-identifying information to be collected or used for any of these purposes, you can simply 'opt out' according to the process described below.

KCRW uses non-identifying aggregate information to analyze use of and better design the KCRW Web site and to share with third parties in aggregate form only as appropriate. For example, we may tell a third party that a certain number of users accessed a particular audio stream on our Web site. However, we will not disclose any information that could be used to identify those users.

 **Security**  
KCRW has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Credit card information provided to the KCRW for subscription purposes is protected against unauthorized use by 128-bit encryption and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security features, which scramble your personal information so that only your web browser and our Web site's server can decipher it.

 **Children**  
Under 13: You must be at least 13 years old in order to order KCRW CDs and transcripts. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not send any information about yourself, including your name, address or e-mail address. If we discover that we have collected any personally-identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our database as soon as possible.

13-18: Unless otherwise specified, you must be at least 18 years old in order to participate in any online contests. Visitors between the ages of 13 and 18 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before KCRW CDs or transcripts, or otherwise sending any personally-identifying information.

 **Corrections to Personal Data; Opting Out**  
Please contact us to a) correct or update any personal information in the KCRW database that you state is erroneous, b) opt-out of future communications from KCRW or c) request KCRW to make reasonable efforts to remove your personal information from the KCRW Online database. The user understands that it may be impossible to delete personal information entirely because of backups and records of deletions.

 **Acceptance of Privacy Policy Terms**  
KCRW reserves the right to change this policy. Any changes to this policy will be posted to this page as soon as reasonably possible, so please check this page periodically. Use of the KCRW Web site constitutes consent to any policy then in effect. Please make sure that you read KCRW's Terms of Use to understand additional terms and conditions which apply to the use of our Web site.

If you have any questions or comments concerning our privacy policy, please [Contact us via e-mail](http://www.kcrw.com/about/contact/contact_main) or send a letter to:

KCRW  
1900 Pico Blvd  
Santa Monica, CA 90405-1628

 **Links to other Sites**  
It is important to note that the KCRW Web site contains links to other sites that may not follow the same privacy policies as the KCRW Web site. For instance, clicking on a sponsorship notice on KCRW.org will take you to an entirely different site. These sites may use cookies, collect data, and use the data in ways that KCRW.org would not. KCRW is not responsible for the privacy practices or any information or materials on these other sites. Please visit these sites if you wish to review their privacy policies.
