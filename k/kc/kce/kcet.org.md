# KCET Online - Privacy Policy.ph - Privacy Policy

  
**COMMUNITY TELEVISION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (KCET)**

Community Television of Southern California ("KCET") respects the privacy rights of its members, donors, viewers and visitors to KCET's websites located at www.kcet.org/.com/.net/; www.shopkcet.org/.com/.net/.tv; aplaceofourown.org/.net/.tv; placeofourown.org/.net/.tv; losninosensucasa.org/.com/.net/.tv; kcetdesertcities.org/.com/.net/.tv; and desertcities.tv (the "KCET Site(s)" or the "Site"). We have prepared this "Privacy Policy" so that you will know how and when we collect information that can specifically identify you ("Personal Information"), and how we use this information. KCET collects Personal Information from its members, donors, viewers, KCET Site users and others through the means discussed in this Privacy Policy. By participating in the KCET activities described below and using the KCET Sites, you acknowledge that you have accepted the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy, the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use.php "Terms of Use"), and, should you participate in an Online Forum (described below) the rules set forth in [Online Forums](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use.php#_3 "Online Forums").

**I. What is Personal Information?**

KCET collects Personal Information, including basic contact information (e.g., your name, email address, address, telephone number) from you, KCET affiliates (e.g., our member stations) and other not-for-profit organizations such as Public Broadcasting Services ("PBS"). KCET may also collect from you additional Personal Information that may be necessary to complete a transaction you requested (e.g., credit card information to process your purchase request). 

**II. How does KCET Collect and Exchange Personal Information?**

Subscription Activities and/or Promotional Events

KCET collects Personal Information through its membership subscriptions, pledges of financial support, and/or services which require subscriptions such as an email or postal newsletter ("Subscription Activities"). KCET may offer various correspondence in connection with its Subscription Activities (e.g., newsletters, postings or other communications) in order to inform its members, donors, viewers and KCET Site visitors about promotions, special offers, events, changes or postings to the KCET Sites. On occasion, we may hold certain contests, sweepstakes or other promotional events ("Promotional Events") and, in connection with those events, we may request that participants provide Personal Information. This information may be used to administer the Promotional Events, and notify and announce winners to the public. We may also exchange Personal Information with organizations controlled by KCET or other not for profit organizations (e.g., Public Broadcasting System ("PBS"), as well as a third party that might offer, sponsor or co-brand a Promotional Event or website ("Sponsoring Third Party(ies)"). For further discussion on Sponsoring Third Parties, please see Section IV. **"May My Personal Information be Disclosed to Others?"**

Personal Information Collected on the KCET Sites

**Automatic Collection of Information:** Like all web servers, the web server(s) of KCET Sites automatically create log files for each visitor who accesses the KCET Sites. These "access logs" allow us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do NOT record a visitor's name, address, phone number, credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information. Rather, they contain some or all of the following non-Personal Information: (a) the Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine which accessed the KCET Sites; (b) the date of the visit; (c) the time of the visit; (d) the path taken through our KCET Sites; (e) the browser being used; (f) a list of files downloaded or viewed; (g) the amount of time spent listening to RealAudio or Windows Media files; and (h) any errors encountered. 

The KCET Sites also use "cookies." Cookies are bits of electronic information that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help keep records of the visitor's use of the site. Cookies allow website operators such as KCET to help customize the site to the visitor's individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet, and many major websites use them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, generally you can change your browser either to prevent this or to notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. KCET may associate information collected through its cookies with individual users, as well as use them to create aggregate and anonymous data. If you choose to not accept the KCET cookies, you may not be able to access certain portions of the KCET Sites.

**Online Forums:** In order to use certain portions of the KCET Sites, we may ask that you become a registered KCET Site user by providing certain personal information such as your age, email address, full name and zip code, as well as creating a user name and password. For example, KCET offers online forums such as blogs, bulletin boards, chat forums, and message boards ("Online Forums"), which may require participant registration. If you choose not to register for such Online Forums and decline to provide certain Personal Information, you may not be able to access and/or participate in KCET Online Forums. 

The nature of Online Forums such as blogging, chat forums and message boards is to share information and ideas with a public audience. Therefore, any information you submit for an Online Forum may be posted on a KCET Site(s) or otherwise be made available to the general public. You are advised to use caution when sharing information during any Online Forum, as any of this information (including, but not limited to, your name and email address) can be collected and used by third parties and may result in your receiving unsolicited communications from third parties. 

**Minors and Online Forums:** Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to divulge any Personal Information when using Online Forums. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the Online Forums. For further discussion, please see our [Kids Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/kids/privacy-policy.php "Kids Privacy Policy") and Section VI. **"Can Minors Use KCET Sites?"**

**Visitors of the KCET Sites:** To enable us to better know and support "visitors" to the KCET Sites (which includes registered and non-registered KCET Site users), we may ask our visitors to voluntarily provide additional information, including Personal Information, such as your name, email address and demographic information, and these requests will be marked "optional" (or the equivalent). For example, by learning about your needs and interests, we may be able to better tailor specific KCET Site features, promotions, contests and other notifications for our members, donors, viewers and KCET Site users. 

**III. How Does KCET Use Personal Information?**

General Uses

KCET may use your Personal Information in the following ways: (1) to respond to your requests for information; (2) to process your purchase requests; (3) to provide you with communications, newsletters, emails and other information as requested by you or as part of your membership or participation in a subscription based service provided by KCET; (4) for contest management; (5) for editorial purposes such as contacting users for an online survey; (6) to send marketing and promotional communications from KCET or KCET member stations to users who have "opted-in" to be in receipt of such communication; (7) for informational notices about KCET or KCET member stations; (8) for purposes included in this Privacy Policy; and (9) for any other use specified at the time the Personal Information is collected or prior to KCET's use of the Personal Information for a new purpose. KCET may also use portions of Personal Information in a manner that is unlikely to directly reveal your identity. For example, if KCET wants to publicly use a quote from an email or online comment from you, we may give attribution to the quote by using your initials and the city and state in which you reside. 

If you would like to "opt-out" of KCET's use of your Personal Information for purposes such as Subscription Activities, Promotional Events and the Online Forums, please follow the directions in Section VII. **"How Do I Update My Personal Information and Privacy Preferences?"** However, by "opting-out", you may adversely impact your ability to participate in and use the foregoing services, as well as prevent KCET from responding or processing your request for information, products or services. 

Creation and Use of Aggregate Information

We may use your Personal Information and other information about or provided by you to create "Aggregated Information". Aggregated Information is created by aggregating or generating statistical data from Personal Information about groups of members, donors, viewers and KCET Site users. Aggregated Information also is anonymous data, because it cannot be used to identify a particular individual. We may use Aggregate Information for marketing, share it with our sponsors, business associates, or other affiliated companies, to better understand visitors to the KCET Sites and our members, and to improve KCET services such as the KCET Sites. 

**IV. May My Personal Information Be Disclosed to Others?**

Personal Information Which May Become Public

As discussed in Section II above, **"Online Forums"** and **"Minors and Online Forums"** , any information that you disclose when participating in the Online Forums may become public, as well as any information disclosed in your participation in Promotional Events. In addition, if you send an e-mail, story idea, essay and/or other submission ("Submission") to KCET, PBS and/or NPR through any KCET Site, we may print that Submission, or an excerpt from it, on the KCET Sites, or read it on air or otherwise publish it in any other medium, together with your name and location (city and state) if you provide that information to us. 

Disclosure of Personal Information

KCET takes reasonable steps to restrict access to the Personal Information that we collect from members, donors, viewers and website visitors, but may provide access as follows: (i) to authorized individuals who may use the Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use.php "Terms of Use"), [Online Forums](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use.php#_3 "Online Forums"), any other applicable agreement between you and KCET, or with your prior consent; (ii) to provide you with customer service; (iii) to protect the rights, property and safety of KCET, its subsidiaries, affiliate, business associates or partners, members, donors, viewers and website visitors or others; (iv) to parties engaged by KCET to process information to fulfill purposes authorized by you (e.g., processing of your credit card payment for a product; shipping to you an ordered product); or (v) relevant parties in the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, joint venture or other business transaction involving KCET. 

Further, KCET may also disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law, or if KCET believes that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or with a legal process such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant or a law enforcement request, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the KCET Site or other KCET content, or (c) protect the personal safety or property of KCET and KCET subsidiaries, affiliates, business associates or partners, members, donors, viewers and website visitors, the public or KCET and its employees. 

Promotional Events Offered by Sponsoring Third Parties

If a Promotional Event or a website is offered by or with a Sponsoring Third Party(ies), your participation in such events or use of the website is your authorization to KCET to exchange your Personal Information with the Sponsoring Third Party(ies). If you do not want your Personal Information to be shared under these circumstances you may choose to not participate. Further, if you would like to "opt-out" of KCET exchanging your Personal Information with a Sponsoring Third Party(ies) as set forth in this paragraph, or if a third party shared your Personal Information with KCET without your authorization, please follow the directions listed below under Section VII. **"How Do I Update My Personal Information and Privacy Preferences?"**

You acknowledge that KCET has no control over, and is not responsible for use and collection of Personal Information by any third party, including Sponsoring Third Parties, and that they may use it for direct marketing purposes. We therefore recommend that you review the privacy policies of these third parties before participating in an event, or using a website, that is controlled, sponsored, or co-branded with a third party so that you may be informed as to how those parties will use and share your Personal Information. 

Links to Third Party Websites

The KCET Sites may contain links, which, if you choose to click, will lead you to websites controlled by third parties. KCET is not responsible or liable for the actions of these third parties, including how they process personal information or for the content posted on their websites. If you decide to use a link on the KCET Sites to visit another website, we encourage you to review the posted privacy policy to learn how any personal information you provide to that site is processed. Your use of a third party website is at your own risk. However, as KCET strives to maintain the integrity and quality of the KCET Sites, you are invited to send your feedback regarding the sites connected through a link on the KCET Sites (including if a link does not work) by sending an email to [viewerservices@kcet.org](mailto:viewerservices@kcet.org). 

**V. Are Online Financial Transactions Secure?**

KCET offers you the convenience of making on-line membership contributions and donations via credit card. KCET uses reasonable precautions to keep this and other Personal Information disclosed to us secure. To reduce the risk of unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure correct usage of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Nonetheless, KCET does not guarantee the security, accuracy or completeness of any such procedures. You should be aware that third parties might unlawfully intercept transmissions of Personal Information or misuse or abuse the Personal Information that we collect from you. 

**VI. Can Minors Use the KCET Sites?**

KCET encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children while online or listening to or watching KCET content. We encourage parents and guardians to learn their children's online interests, participate in the interactive activities offered online and used by their children and for children to obtain parental consent before submitting any information to any website, including the KCET Sites. 

**Use of Online Forums:** Minors under that age of 13 are not permitted to use the Online Forum section of the Site. Please see Paragraph IV of the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use.php#_4 "Children Under the Age of 13") and the [Kids Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/kids/privacy-policy.php "Kids Privacy Policy") for further information. 

**Submissions to KCET Sites:** If a person indicating that he/she is under 18 submits information and/or content to a KCET Site, KCET may decide, in its sole discretion, to condition use of such information and/or content on KCET's receipt of parental consent. KCET shall notify the parent of users under the age of 18 if that user wins a KCET contest, sweepstakes or game. Please see Paragraph IV of the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use.php#_5 "Copyright and Trademark Information") and the KCET and the [Kids Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/kids/privacy-policy.php "Kids Privacy Policy") for further information. 

**VII. How Do I Update My Personal Information and Privacy Preferences?**

If at any time you need to update your Personal Information with KCET, notify us of your preference ("opt-out" versus "opt-in"), change your preference as to receipt of KCET newsletters and promotional materials or our sharing of your Personal Information with third parties, or if you just have a question, comment or concern about how KCET uses your Personal Information, simply contact us in writing as follows:
