Information Collection
Most websites gather information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol
(IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp,
and click-stream data. They may use this information, which does not identify individual visitors, to analyze trends,
to administer the website, to track visitors’ movements around the site and to gather information about the
geographic location of our visitors as a whole. We do not collect any such information from our visitors.
Additionally, we do not collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) about our visitors at this website. No
information regarding our visitors is collected at this website in any manner whatsoever or for any purpose.
Cookies
A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.
When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user
preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.
We do not use cookies, and therefore do not automatically record information when you visit our website.
