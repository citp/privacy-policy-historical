> Cookies and Web Beacons. When you visit our Site, we send cookies to your computer and use web beacons in order to track your trends and preferences. A cookie is a data text file that a web site sends to your browser and which is then stored on your system. Our Site can only access the information from a cookie sent by our Site. We cannot learn your e-mail address or any other personal information about you through a cookie. Rather, cookies are used to gather information about your use of the Site and how we can adapt our services to better suit your needs and preferences. Cookies identify you to our server, meaning that our Site will recognize you when you return to visit the Site. Many browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to inform you when a cookie is being sent. Web beacons are invisible images that are used to write cookies or access the cookies we have written previously or to access information about the page you are viewing for the purposes of recognizing returning users and analyzing patterns. A web beacon cannot access cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained in those cookies.

> Third-Party Advertising Servers and Networks. We use third-party advertising servers to display ads on our Site, and we use third parties to measure and track statistical information about our Site. These third parties may place or recognize a cookie or web beacon on your browser. The information provided by these cookies and web beacons is used to deliver advertising targeted to your interests, and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and other sites tracked by these third parties. We do not have control over the practices of these third parties. The third parties do not receive or learn your e-mail address or other personal information through these technologies. We currently maintain relationships with [Nielsen NetRatings] and other entities to provide statistical and ad placement services. These parties may provide a way to opt out of their cookies and web beacons. You can find more information about the practices of these parties by visiting the websites of the individual parties or the Network Advertising Initiative.
