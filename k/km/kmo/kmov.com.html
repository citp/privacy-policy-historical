as of March 3, 2004</b><br><br> This Privacy Policy discloses the general privacy 
practices for the Belo Interactive web sites, including KMOV.com. Belo Interactive, 
Inc. ("Belo Interactive") is a subsidiary of Belo Corp. <br><br> Belo Interactive 
is committed to respecting your privacy rights when visiting any Belo Interactive 
web site, such as this one. To protect your Personal Information, Belo Interactive 
has created the guidelines outlined below. Understanding that Internet technologies 
are rapidly evolving, any changes to this policy will be promptly posted on this 
page, with an updated "effective date" posted at the end of this policy. <br><br> 
<b>Information Collected: </b><br><br> While visiting any of the Belo Interactive 
web sites (collectively, the "Site"), we may ask you to register and/or provide 
information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes 
of interacting with the Site. Such Personal Information may include, but is not 
limited to, your name, phone number, street address, and e-mail address. On any 
page that collects Personal Information, we will specifically describe what information 
is required in order to provide you with the product or service, enter you in 
the promotion you have requested, or respond to your inquiry or comment. <br><br> 
<b>What are Cookies? </b>A cookie is a small data text file that a web site sends 
to your browser, which is stored on your system. The Site can only access the 
information from a cookie sent by the Site. We cannot access cookies sent by other 
web sites or the information contained therein. Additionally, we cannot learn 
your e-mail address or any other information about you through the use of a cookie. 
The only way we would learn such information is if you specifically and voluntarily 
submit that information to us, for example, through a registration system, or 
by entering a sweepstakes or promotion. <br><br> We use an advertising server 
developed by a third party to display ads on the Site. Some of these ads may contain 
cookies that are sent by third parties (e.g. advertising agencies or advertising 
clients). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they 
contain. We encourage you to contact the advertiser or its privacy policy for 
more information on these cookies. Links from other Web sites that appear on the 
Site may also send cookies; but we do not control such activities. <br><br> <b>Why 
does the Site use cookies?</b> Belo Interactive uses cookies to track usage of 
the Site and further personalize your experience when you are visiting the Site. 
By tracking usage, we can best determine what features of the Site best serve 
the users. <br><br> <b>What benefits do I receive from cookies?</b> Overall, the 
use of cookies helps to give you a more personalized experience at the Site. The 
information is used to keep our Site fresh and relevant to you the user. Cookies 
also identify you to our server, allowing you to avoid retyping your e-mail address 
and password each time you access the Site. <br><br> <b>May I decline to accept 
a cookie?</b> You may decline to accept cookies sent by the Site by selecting 
an option on your browser to reject cookies. However, portions of the Site which 
require registration will not be accessible to you. In such cases, we ask that 
you register and provide us with basic information on our registration page, or 
sign in if previously registered. Cookies enable our server to know that you are 
a registered user, and will eliminate the need for you to log in each time you 
access our Site. <br><br> <b>IP Addresses:</b> Belo Interactive logs IP addresses, 
or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and 
troubleshooting purposes and to determine site usage. Your IP address does not 
contain personal information about you. <br><br> <b>Use of Personal Information 
</b><br><br> We believe in protecting your privacy, and will not share Personal 
Information with third parties outside of Belo Corp. except as described in this 
Privacy Policy. We believe we can enhance your experience on our Site with the 
information you share with us. We use Personal Information about you to improve 
our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze Site usage, to 
improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the Site's content, 
layout, and services. We may also use your Personal Information, such as your 
e-mail address or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services 
that may be of interest to you, to respond to an inquiry from you regarding the 
information that we have collected, or respond to your comments and suggestions. 
<br><br> Belo Interactive may match specific and/or aggregated Personal Information 
with third party data to provide you with product and content offerings that interest 
you and improve our advertising and marketing efforts. Belo Interactive also may 
disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to potential 
advertisers, partners, other third parties, our affiliate companies, and for other 
lawful purposes. <br><br> As part of your experience on our Site, you may receive 
communications from us related to products and services that might interest you. 
While we believe these services will enhance your experience at our Site, you 
will at all times be able to opt out from receiving these communications, either 
by specifically opting out of these services or by deleting your profile from 
our database. Please refer to "Opting-Out" for further reference. <br><br> We 
have today, and will in the future have, arrangements with third party service 
providers, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and fulfillment 
services. When you sign up for a service we offer on the Site, we may be required 
to share Personal Information with that service provider in order to provide the 
service. These third party providers are required to comply with this policy and 
protect your information in the same way we do. They are not permitted to retain 
or use Personal Information for any purpose unrelated to providing the service. 
<br><br> Belo Interactive may also offer other services as a part of our Site 
(e.g., car buying service, personalized finance and weather information alerts, 
contests, sweepstakes and other promotions with unaffiliated third parties). If 
you choose to use these optional services or opportunities, we may provide some 
of your Personal Information to these parties. We will not do so without telling 
you in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing 
not to use these services or features of the Site. Some of these third parties 
may also collect their own Personal Information in connection with providing the 
service. We encourage you to check the applicable privacy policy for that portion 
of the Site prior to disclosing Personal Information. Please refer to "Party Collecting 
the Information" for further reference. <br><br> We may provide Personal Information 
to our affiliated companies in order to improve our marketing and advertising 
efforts and your experience with our Site. Although this Privacy Policy generally 
applies only to Belo Interactive, and not to activities or information collected 
by our offline partners, in the event we share Personal Information you provide 
us on the Site, we will require that our affiliated companies comply with this 
policy with respect to that information and protect your information in the same 
way we do. <br><br> We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information when 
needed to comply with the law or a legal process, cooperate with investigations 
of purported unlawful activities, to identify persons violating the law, or in 
connection with the sale of part or all of Belo Interactive's or its affiliate's 
stock or assets. <br><br> <b>Party Collecting the Information</b><br><br> This 
Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that we 
collect from you. To the extent that you disclose any information to other parties, 
whether through, for example, on-line auctions, chat rooms, personal ads, or the 
like, through third party services or promotions offered on or through the Site 
or through other web sites throughout the Internet, different policies may apply 
and Belo Interactive shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of 
such information. <br><br> The Site may offer forums, message boards, or chat 
rooms as one of the services on the Site. If you disclose personal information 
in one of these forums, this information can be viewed, collected, and used by 
others. Belo Interactive is not responsible for the use of information you disclose 
in these forums. We encourage you to consult the Forum Rules regarding the policies 
and procedures that apply to that portion of the Site. <br><br> Our Sites may 
operate as part of a larger group of sites, and may carry co-branded pages. In 
addition, other sites may use the Site's or Belo Interactive's name. Since Belo 
Interactive does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject 
to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of such third parties, and Belo Interactive 
shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your private information 
by such parties. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions and review those 
parties' privacy policies before you disclose your Personal Information to others. 
<br><br> <b>Third Party Advertising</b> </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
use MaxWorldwide and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when 
you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your 
name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and 
other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites 
about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more 
information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this 
information used by these companies, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">click 
here</a>. <br><br> <b>Third Party Cookies</b><br><br> In the course of serving 
advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize 
a unique "cookie" on your browser. <br><br> <b>Links to Other Materials</b><br><br> 
Third party sites linked to and from the Site are not necessarily under the control 
of Belo Interactive. Belo Interactive shall have no responsibilities or liabilities 
whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such linked site or any 
link or linking program at any time. Belo Interactive does not necessarily endorse 
companies (or related products or services) to or from which the Site is linked. 
If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to the Site, you do 
so entirely at your own risk. <br><br> <b>Children's Privacy</b><br><br> Belo 
Interactive cares about the safety of children and their use of the Internet. 
Therefore, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 
1998, we will never knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable information 
from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. In the event 
that we receive actual knowledge that we have collected such personal information 
without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information 
from our database as quickly as is practicable. <br><br> <b>Opting-Out</b><br><br> 
We respect your privacy and ability to choose whether to share information with 
us and any third party. You may choose to "opt-out" of sharing Personal Information 
in several ways. When choosing to use certain features or services on the Site, 
you can choose whether to share optional Personal Information in connection with 
the feature or service. If you receive communications from us that you prefer 
not to receive, you may opt out from receiving these communications, by modifying 
the contact options in your registration profile. <br><br> There are four contact 
preference options available: (1) "opt-in" includes you in our special offer, 
discount and other programs with respect to our advertisers and partners via our 
My Specials Direct e-mail program or a similar program; (2) "site" includes you 
in our special offer, discount and other programs that relate to this Site from 
KMOV.com (3) "phone" allows you to be contacted by telephone with respect to any 
of these programs, and (4) "mail" allows you to be contacted by mail with respect 
to any of these programs. You may choose to be contacted by any or all of these 
methods, or "opt-out" by not selecting any contact options. You may change your 
contact options at any time by following the process described in "Reviewing, 
Changing, and Deleting Your Personal Information." <br><br> In addition to opting-out 
by managing your contact preference options, you may opt-out from receiving e-mail 
communications from any site service by sending your request to helpcenter@belointeractive.com, 
or by sending postal mail to: <br><br> Belo Interactive<br> Attn: "Opt-Out Request" 
<br> 900 Jackson Street, Suite 400<br> Dallas, TX 75202 <br><br> You may "opt-out" 
altogether from providing Personal Information to us by not registering on the 
Site and thereby not providing Personal Information. You may also choose at a 
later date to have your name removed from our database by deleting your registration 
profile. To do so, please follow the process described in "Reviewing, Changing, 
and Deleting Your Personal Information." <br><br> Certain portions of the Site 
and certain services provided on the Site, however, do require registration in 
order to access or use these areas and services. If you choose not to register 
or provide certain information, these areas will not be accessible to you. <br><br> 
<b>Notifying Advertisers of Opt-Outs, by Law</b><br><br> When any site user chooses 
to opt-out of a specific advertiser program, to comply with federal law, we will 
furnish that user's e-mail address to only the affected advertiser and only for 
the purpose of ensuring that address is removed from the advertiser's own distribution 
lists per the user's opt-out request. <br><br> <b>Reviewing, Changing and Deleting 
Your Personal Information</b><br><br> You may access all of the Personal Information 
that we collect from you online and maintain by using the procedure that follows. 
We use this procedure to better safeguard your Personal Information. To protect 
your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity 
before granting access or making corrections. <br> You may also at any time choose 
to change or delete your profile from our database using this procedure. You should 
know that if you choose to delete your profile, certain areas of our Site may 
no longer be accessible to you. <br> 1. Enter (or click) <a href="http://signin.kmov.com">http://signin.kmov.com</a> 
in your browser. <br> 2. Sign in by entering your e-mail address and password. 
Your account information will then be displayed. <br> 3. To change your contact 
options select "Contact Options," make your selections, and submit the form. <br> 
4. To remove your registration profile from our database, select "Delete My Account," 
make your selections, and submit the form. <br> <br><br> <b>Security </b><br><br> 
Belo Interactive maintains industry standard safeguards to ensure the security, 
integrity, and privacy of the Personal Information that you provide to Belo Interactive. 
<br><br> <b>Contacting Us </b><br><br> If you have any questions or comments about 
our Privacy Policy, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:helpcenter@belointeractive.com">helpcenter@belointeractive.com</a>. 
<br><br> <b>Effective Date and Changes</b><br><br> This Privacy Policy is effective
