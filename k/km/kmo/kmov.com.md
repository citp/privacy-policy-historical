# KMOV-TV 4 St. Louis | Legal Guidelines & Privacy Policy

| 

* * *

  Like many other commercial sites, KMOV.com collects information that helps us to improve our services and bring you information suited to your individual needs. At the same time, we recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personal identifying information of our visitors. We believe that protection of personal privacy on the web not only protects consumers, but also increases consumer confidence. In adopting this privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests with your reasonable expectations of privacy.

This privacy policy describes what information KMOV.com collects, how we use it, and to whom we may disclose it. As described below, you may opt-out of certain uses of your personal information - and we require your consent for any online collection of your child’s information, and for the use and disclosure of that information. If anything in this privacy policy changes, we will post the changes on our homepage, and we will not disclose your information in a way that you have not authorized. 

**Information Collection and Use** ****

* * *

**** KMOV.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 

Users are advised that KMOV.com does not operate the “My Finance” service promoted on our website, a service which customizes financial data, weather information, and news for individual users. Users leave KMOV.com and link to a separate site operated by MicroStrategy, Inc. at strategy.com. The privacy policy for MicroStrategy can be found at [http://home.strategy.com/BELO/Help/Help_PortalPrivacy.asp ](http://home.strategy.com/BELO/Help/Help_PortalPrivacy.asp). You should review that policy before submitting information at strategy.com. MicroStrategy may share your personal information with KMOV.com.

In addition, the television listings information service is provided by one.clicktv.com, a separate website which may follow different information practices than those described here. Similarly, features in the 4 More section may be provided by other websites which are not under the control of KMOV.com, such as www.ParentTime.com. And the content and information practices of CBSNEWS.com are under the control of the CBS network, which is under separate ownership than KMOV.com. 

**Children’s Privacy** ****

* * *

**** If KMOV.com has reason to believe that a visitor under the age of 13 has submitted any personal information, KMOV.com will use that information for no other purpose than to answer, on a single time basis, a question asked by that visitor. KMOV.com will discard all information received from that website user, and KMOV.com will not share the information with its parent company or with any other person, business or organization. 

**Cookies** ****

* * *

**** A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. KMOV.com may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information. Also, our parent company, A.H. Belo, uses a feature of your web browser to place an electronic file - or cookie - on your computer. We do not collect any information from, or have access to, this file. Inquiries concerning this cookie should be directed to Belo.com. In addition, some of our business partners and advertisers may use cookies on our site. However, KMOV.com has no access to or control over these cookies.

**Log Files** ****

* * *

**** We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We would not, however, link IP addresses to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing Information with Other Parties** ****

* * *

**** We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. For example, we may inform an advertiser that a certain percentage of our registered users are men over the age of 30. The aggregate demographic information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We may partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names or other contact information necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

**Special Offers and Promotions** ****

* * *

**** Registered users may occasionally receive from us information on products, services, and special deals. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out section below. 

The promotional information will always be sent to you by KMOV; we will not give your contact information to third parties.

**Links** ****

* * *

**** This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that KMOV.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

For example, KMOV.com provides a link to CBSNEWS.com, which is under separate ownership and control. KMOV.com is not responsible for the content or information practices of that site. The privacy policy for CBSNEWS.com can be found at [ http://cbsnews.cbs.com/now/story/0,1597,53940-412,00.shtml](http://cbsnews.cbs.com/now/story/0,1597,53940-412,00.shtml). Other examples of independently controlled linked websites include ParentTime.com and one.clicktv.com.

**Contests** ****

* * *

**** From time-to-time our site may conduct contests. Participation in these contests is entirely voluntary, and does not affect your access to other features of the website. However, you must provide us with contact information in order to participate, so that we can notify the winners and award prizes. 

**Security** ****

* * *

**** This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. All of our users’ information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Additionally, our website is hosted by a company that employs the latest technological security measures to protect data.

**Supplementation of Information** ****

* * *

**** In order for this website to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual’s preference, we will combine information submitted by users with other information which we have collected, such as contest awards.

**Access to Personal Information** ****

* * *

**** If a user’s personally identifiable information (such as your address) changes, or if a user no longer desires to receive services from our website, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. Users can send an email to [ webmaster@kmov.com ](mailto:webmaster@kmov.com).

**Choice/Opt-out** ****

* * *

**** Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. 

Users who no longer wish to receive promotional materials from us on behalf of our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by sending an email message to [ webmaster@kmov.com ](mailto:webmaster@kmov.com).

Parents always have the right to prevent us from collecting or disclosing the information described in this policy, as it relates to their children under the age of 13. 

**Notification of Changes** ****

* * *

**** If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact [webmaster@kmov.com](mailto:webmaster@kmov.com) or contact:
