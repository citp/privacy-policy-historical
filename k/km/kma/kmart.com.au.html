				<p>Below is a privacy statement that applies to Kmart.</p>
				<h3>You know us - you can trust us</h3>
				<p>At Kmart, we understand and share our customers' and employees concerns about how personal information is collected, used and shared. We want to assure you that we will always handle personal information securely and carefully. We are committed to safeguarding your information; this means that, among other things, we will comply with all applicable Australian privacy laws and ensure our staff are aware of their obligations.</p>
				<h3>Why we collect information</h3>
				<p>We may collect information to deliver products or services to complete other transactions and better understand our customers requirements and preferences. This information enables us to personalise and improve our service and in particular to provide offers that are of greater interest or benefit.</p>
				<h3>How we collect this information</h3>
				<p>When a customer places an order and/or register their details with us, we store that information for future reference. This saves time when customers shop with us again, as we do not have to re-enter customer details. Sometimes we may add customers personal information with information from external sources. This is mainly done to verify the accuracy of the information we have and, again, to personalise and improve our service.</p>
				<h3>What we collect</h3>
				<p>The personal information we collect is in most cases supplied when customers register details, place an order or provide feedback to us. Generally, the information we collect includes customer name, address, delivery address, phone number and e-mail address. We will sometimes obtain other details, such as age. Through business partners such as FlyBuys and GE Capital Finance, who administer our store cards, we also have access to purchasing information.</p>
				<h3>Who we may share your information with</h3>
				<p>We will often need to pass personal details such as name and address to companies who perform parts of our service delivery. This includes organisations such as major delivery companies, out-sourced call centres, mail houses and third party fulfilment contractors. In special circumstances, for example if we sell our business or a substantial part of our business, your information may be transferred as part of that sale. We will not use customer/employee information for purposes unrelated to the services we provide, unless we first obtain your consent. From time to time, we may provide aggregated and "de-identified" information to other business partners for various purposes. If you would like to access your personal information, please e-mail your request to Customer Satisfaction Compliance Manager or contact our customer service department on <a href="mailto:customer.satisfaction@kmart.com.au">customer.satisfaction@kmart.com.au</a></p>
				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>We will take all reasonable steps to store your personal information securely. Only specific employees in our customer service, marketing, human resources, store systems and IT areas have access to our customers' and employee personal information, and only under strict controls and procedures.</p>
				<h3>Other Sites</h3>
				<p>Kmart is not responsible for the privacy practices of sites that are linked to this site via hyperlinks, banner advertising or otherwise. Please take care at all times to check whose site you are visiting.</p>
				<h3>Direct marketing</h3>
				<p>If you do not wish to receive direct marketing offers from Kmart, please call our customer service centre on 1800 634 251</p>
				<h3>Kmart and Coles Myer Ltd Privacy Policies and Practices</h3>
				<p>From time to time and in line with customer expectations and legislative changes, our privacy policies and procedures will be reviewed and, if appropriate, updated. Please click <a href="http://www.colesmyer.com/home/privacy.asp" target="_blank">here</a> if you wish to read the Coles Myer Ltd Privacy Policy. More information on privacy legislation is available from the Federal Privacy Commissioner at <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/" target="_blank">www.privacy.gov.au</a>.</p>
				<h3>About cookies and how they work</h3>
				<p>When you interact with us on the internet, our system will automatically send you a "cookie". A cookie is a small amount of information sent from a web server to your computer, enabling your computer to be recognised while the current <b>Session</b> lasts. It is used to handle your <em>Session</em> and contains a unique number only. This number becomes invalid as soon as your <b>Session</b> ends. Usually 30 minutes after you left the site or you closed your browser.</p>
