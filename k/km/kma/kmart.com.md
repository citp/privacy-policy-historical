This privacy policy explains how Kmart.com collects, uses, and discloses the information of users of the www.Kmart.com Website (the "Kmart.com Website," or "our Website") and the Kmart.com ISP Services ("the ISP Services"), which are administered by our partners and contractors. ("ISP Service Partners"). 

When reviewing any privacy policy on the Internet, you should be familiar with the terms "personally identifiable information" and "aggregate information." "Personally identifiable information" is any information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate you as an individual. Common examples are your name and email address. 

"Aggregate information" lumps your behavior or characteristics together with those of a group. For instance, we may let advertisers know that 50% of our users are over 35 without disclosing the personal information of any one individual.

**Collecting your information**

This section explains what information we collect through the Kmart.com Website and ISP Services. Please note that we correlate and supplement this data with both aggregate and personally identifiable information gathered by other companies. For example, Kmart collects personally identifiable information and information relating to customer purchases in its retail stores, and then shares this information with us. 

Important: Children under the age of 18 should use our Website under the supervision of their parents or guardians.

**Information collected through our Website**

When you register for the Kmart.com Website we collect personally identifiable information, including (but not limited to) your name, physical address, email address, phone numbers, and billing information. All of this information is mandatory; without it we will not register you. We also collect personally identifiable information through purchase forms, surveys, sweepstakes entries, emails we receive from you, and your other interactions with our Website. 

When you use our Website we may collect a variety of technical data, which we store in both aggregate and, if you are registered with BlueLight, personally identifiable forms. This data includes (but is not limited to) your IP address (a unique number that identifies your access account on the Internet), domain, and Web browser information. We may track the page you visited before coming to BlueLight, and the page you link to when you leave BlueLight, which of our pages you access, and how long you spend on each page. 

The Kmart.com Website uses "cookies," which are small pieces of information stored on your computer. Cookies let our Website recognize previous visitors to our web page, record a visitor's progress from page to page, and recall certain information a visitor entered previously. For instance, a cookie may store your password, or note that you're interested in electronics. You can choose to decline our cookies (e.g., by setting your browser to reject cookies), but if you do, some parts of the Kmart.com website may not operate properly. We may also use tracking images and applets to collect the same information. 

We allow third parties to collect aggregate and other anonymous information about our visitors through the Kmart.com Website. Should we enter into agreements that allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information about our visitors, we will inform visitors of these activities at the location of the collection. 

Finally, note that our Website contains links to other sites on the Internet. Please remember that when you click on one of these links, you are leaving our Website and entering another. Again, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites, and encourage you to read their privacy statements (which may differ from ours). 

  


**Information collected through the ISP Services**

When you register for the ISP Services we collect personally identifiable information including (but not limited to) your name, home address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, birth date, gender, occupation, industry of employment, number of people in your household, the number of people in your household under 18, marital status, whether you own your residence, your current level of education, your household income, how you found out about our ISP Services, whether you shop at Kmart, whether you are willing to make purchases over the Internet, your areas of interest, and whether you would like to be contacted in the future. We also collect personally identifiable information when you communicate with us by sending email messages or other correspondence, or when you submit online forms and other such items. 

When you use the ISP Services we collect a variety of technical data, which we store in both aggregate and personally identifiable form. This data includes (but is not limited to) (a) the sites you visit (by URL, or Universal Resource Locator) while on the ISP Services, the interactions you have with those sites, and the taskbar advertisements on which you click, and (b) usage information such as the telephone numbers from which and to which you dial into our ISP Services (including unsuccessful dial-in attempts), the time you spend online, and your IP address. The ISP Services also use cookies to identify you and record your Web surfing habits and the advertisements upon which you click. 

We collect your information (personally identifiable information, aggregated information, or both) through one or more of our ISP Service Partners' servers, and through cookies, banners, and the like. The information collected via the taskbar portion of our ISP Services includes (but is not limited to) the type of ad banner displayed, the times the banner was displayed, and whether you clicked on the ad. 

As you use the ISP Services you will have access to millions of websites maintained by third parties with whom we have no relationship. These third parties may also collect aggregate and personally identifiable information about you through their websites, banner ads, forms, and other methods. Again, the information practices of those third parties are not covered by this privacy statement. Kmart.com has no control over and is not responsible for the practices or the conduct of these other companies. 

This section describes how we use and disclose the information we collect.

We use aggregate information about your behavior and equipment to improve the performance of our Website and ISP Services, and to evaluate your reaction to the content and design of the BlueLight Website. We may use personally identifiable information to customize the content and layout of our Website's pages for you, to store your BlueLight account information, to record Website session information (such as items you have added to your shopping cart) order status, and to store your purchase history.

We also use personally identifiable and aggregate information for a variety of marketing and promotional purposes. For instance, we use what we have learned about your preferences to alert you to new areas when you return to our Website, or to help us or our business partners target advertising or product placements to your particular interests. On the ISP service, these customized advertisements appear on the banner bar of your computer screen. 

We do not intentionally share your personally identifiable information, except: (a) with our ISP Service Partners (including start page and home page providers for the ISP Services); (b) with Kmart and our other corporate affiliates; (c) with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.; (d) with other companies with whom we have substantial strategic or marketing relationships (including our ISP Partners); (e) with companies to whom we outsource certain functions of our Website and the ISP Services ); (f) as required by law; and (g) in event of Kmart.com's insolvency, with another entity in connection with the sale of Kmart.com assets. In addition, if you indicate your desire to receive a particular service or information from another company (e.g., catalogs), BlueLight will share your personally identifiable information with that particular company. Note finally that we share aggregate data about our customers with third parties. 

From time to time we will send you emails related to your Kmart.com Website or the ISP Services accounts. At various points during your visits to Kmart.com, you are provided opportunities to indicate an interest in receiving email about special offers and other promotional information.

If you supply us with your postal address you may receive periodic mailings from us related to your Kmart.com Website or ISP Services accounts. We (or other organizations with whom we share your information) may also mail you information about new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know (using the contact information below); make sure to provide us with your exact name and address. We will be sure your name is removed from our mailing list and the list we share with other organizations.

Please note that the date of the most recent opt in/out request will supercede prior requests. 

Upon your reasonable request via the contact information below (and subject to our security practices), we will provide you with access to your contact information (for example, name, address, phone number), financial information, unique identifier information (for example, customer number or password), and transaction information (for example, when and what you purchased from our Website). If you're a registered Kmart.com Website member, you can sign in and access your Website account information from the Website My Account page.

Any Kmart.com Website and ISP Services accounts you may have are password-protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Neither BlueLight nor our ISP Service Partners will ever ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. 

We have instituted security measures in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. In addition, we always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving customer data exchanged with our Website. We've also implemented industry standard security measures for our ISP. 

Please keep in mind, however, that no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit using our Website or ISP Services, and you transmit such information at your own risk.
