 FACTS            WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
 Why?             Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
                  consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell

                  carefully to understand what we do.

                  members’ personal information; the reasons Kern Schools Federal Credit Union chooses to
