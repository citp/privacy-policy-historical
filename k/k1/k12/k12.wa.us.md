# Privacy Policy | OSPI

## Introduction

OSPI collects data when you visit our website and this page outlines our Privacy Policy. This is an outline of how we handle your data and the relevant state and federal laws that apply to personally identifiable information that you might provide in the course of navigating this site.

## Data Collection and Use

When you browse this website, we may collect and store information about your visit such as:

  * The internet domain and network address you use to access our site;
  * The type of web browser and operating system you are using;
  * The date and time of your visit;
  * The pages you visit on this website;
  * The last website you visited before coming to ours; and
  * Other web traffic statistics.



OSPI saves the information we collect to help us understand how people are using our services and we use that data to improve the services we offer.

If you volunteer information on our website such as participate in a survey, send us an email, or perform some other transaction online, the following additional information may be collected:

  * Your email address and contents of the email.
  * Information volunteered in response to a survey.
  * Information volunteered through an online form for any other purpose.



We save what you send us. The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information. Any emails you send to us may be used to respond to issues and to further improve our services. We may forward your email to another agency or a vendor for appropriate action.

The records retention schedules published by the [State Archives](http://www.sos.wa.gov/archives/) require us to keep this information for a limited time period and then we destroy it.

## Personal Information

Personally identifiable information ("PII") as defined in this Privacy Policy, means information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as your name, address, and phone number.

We will not collect PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us an email, or completing an online form or survey. You may choose not to contact us by email or to provide any PII using an online form or survey. Your choice to not participate in these activities will not restrict your ability to access information provided on our site. If you choose to provide PII by emailing us, participating in a survey, or completing an online form, we may store this information.

The [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title15/html/USCODE-2011-title15-chap91-sec6501.htm) (COPPA) governs information gathering online from or about children under the age of 13. We are especially concerned about protecting children's privacy. Under COPPA, a website must get parental permission before collecting PII about a child under the age of 13.

## Public Access to Information

In Washington state, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Both federal and state laws provide exceptions.

As a public agency, all our information is governed by laws such as Washington's Public Records Act [RCW 42.56](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56) (link is external). Information you send us may become a public record, and it may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by federal or state law.

Information collected through the use of this site may be public information and subject to inspection and copying by members of the public. For example, the Public Records Act states that:

> Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of this section [[RCW 42.56.070(6)](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.070) (link is external)], [Chapter 42.56 RCW](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56) (link is external), or other statutes which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by [Chapter 42.56 RCW](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56) (link is external), an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with [Chapter 42.56 RCW](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56) (link is external) when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.
> 
> In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Public Records Act or other law governing the agency's disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.

## Correcting Personally Identifiable Information

State law requires agencies that collect PII to provide "procedures for correcting inaccurate information, including establishing mechanisms for individuals to review information about them and recommend changes in information they believe to be inaccurate." ([RCW 43.105.365](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.105.365) (link is external))

You can access any PII we collect about you by using the information in the contact information in the callout section to the right of this page. We will do our best to make corrections if you send us a written request that demonstrates a factual error. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
