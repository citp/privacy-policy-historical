At K12, respecting your privacy is an important matter. Accordingly, we will not sell any personal or identifiable information you supply to us. 
<br><br>
Please review the full policy below for more details. If you have questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, e-mail <a href="mailto:privacy@K12.com">privacy@K12.com</a>. 
<br><br>
<span class="bold-a">Collection of Information</span><br>
When you register, we ask for your name, e-mail address, and other profile information, such as credit card and billing information. We may request additional profile information for optional online surveys and identification verification. 
<br><br>
In the course of using our website, we log certain information, including your IP address, the browser you are using, and the previous URL you were visiting. 
<br><br>
We personalize your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests, based on your browsing and message activity. 
<br><br>
If you send us correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities on the website, we may store such information so that we can serve you better. 
<br><br>
<span class="bold-a">Use of Your Information</span><br> 
We use profile information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, review website usage, and improve our website's content, offerings, and layout. 
<br><br>
We may use profile information for market research purposes and to generate aggregate reports on students' interests and behaviors. We will not identify specific individuals in reports. 
<br><br>
With your prior approval, we may use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about new offerings from K12 and special offers we think you will find useful. If you would rather not receive such notices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@K12.com">privacy@K12.com</a>. 
<br><br>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. 
<br><br>
We use your e-mail address, and in some situations, your mailing address or your phone or fax number to contact you when necessary. (For example, an agent of K12 may contact you to ensure you are satisfied with the service.) 
<br><br>
In the absence of a special relationship, we do not pass on your profile information to any third party without your express permission, but we may distribute aggregate information to other parties for marketing and promotional purposes. You cannot be personally identified from this aggregate information. Certain information, such as your password or credit card number, is not disclosed. 
<br><br>
We may occasionally partner with another company. By this we mean that a portion or version of our website is integrated into our partner's website or is integrated with our partner's content or branding. We may agree to share your information with them. However, if we share such information, we do so only under strict confidentiality. 
<br><br>
We may disclose user information in special cases, for example, when we have reason to believe it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with (either intentionally or unintentionally) K12's rights or property, other K12 users, or anyone who could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose user information when we believe, in good faith, that the law requires it. 
<br><br>
We may set and access cookies on your computer. We use cookies for a number of purposes, including but not limited to the following: providing customized content, keeping track of your preferences, estimating and reporting total K12 website audience size and traffic, and conducting research to improve K12 content and services. 
<br><br>
<span class="bold-a">Notification of Changes</span><br> 
If at some point there is a change to our information usage practices that affects your personal or identifiable information, we will notify you by e-mail of the relevant changes. At the time of that message, you will be able to opt out of this information usage by sending an e-mail message to <a href="mailto:privacy@K12.com">privacy@K12.com</a>. You should periodically check our posted privacy statement for changes. 
<br><br>
<span class="bold-a">Control of Passwords</span><br> 
You are required to control your password as described in the K12 User Agreement. 
<br><br>
If you have forgotten your password, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@K12.com">privacy@K12.com</a>. Your password will be e-mailed to you shortly thereafter. 
<br><br>
K12 will never ask for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. 
<br><br>
<span class="bold-a">Security</span><br> 
Transmission of information over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, but some websites take greater precautions than others to protect the privacy and security of their users. While the Internet is not a locked-down environment, K12 places a high premium on security and privacy. 
<br><br>
We use Secure Socket Layers (SSL) to encrypt sensitive data you send to us. Access to our site is password protected. A high-strength firewall protects our database from outsiders. The physical devices running K12 reside in one of the country's most respected hosting location facilities. 
<br><br>
<span class="bold-a">Consent</span><br>
By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of the above-described information by K12. 
<br><br>
<span class="bold-a">Other</span><br>
This site may contain links to other websites; K12 is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. 
<br><br>
You have the option to change or modify information previously provided by revising your member profile online or by contacting K12 via e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@K12.com">privacy@K12.com</a>. 
<br><br>
While completing the registration form you can choose not to receive the occasional e-mails with special offers and ideas. If you choose yes and later decide you don't want these e-mails, simply contact K12 at <a href="mailto:privacy@K12.com">privacy@K12.com</a>. 
<br><br>
<span class="bold-a">Children's Privacy Policy</span><br>
K12 ordinarily accepts service agreements established by persons over the age of 18. When someone under the age of 18 attempts to register with K12, we ask that he or she have a parent or guardian establish a service agreement in order to obtain parental consent. 
<br><br>
When any user registers for K12's products and services, we require a name, e-mail address, zip code, and credit card information. K12 also asks users to provide other optional information, including gender and date of birth. 
<br><br>
K12 uses this information for research and to create and maintain accounts, and may use this information to customize the advertising and content seen on our pages. 
<br><br>
Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no website operator can require, as a condition of participation in an activity, that a child under the age of 13 disclose more information than is reasonably necessary. K12 abides by this requirement. 
<br><br>
<span class="bold-a">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span><br>
K12 will not rent or sell children's personal or identifiable information to anyone. 
<br><br>
K12 will not contact children under the age of 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without parental consent. K12 will send personal or identifiable information about a child to other companies or people under the following conditions: 
<ul>
<li>We have a parent's consent to share the information. Parents have the option of allowing K12 to collect and use their child's information without consenting to K12 sharing this information with other people and companies. 
</li><li>We need to send the information to companies working on behalf of K12 to provide a product or service that has been requested. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personal or identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us. 
</li><li>We must respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process (to the extent permitted by law). 
</li></ul>
<span class="bold-a">Ability to Update or Delete Information</span><br> 
Children can update or delete information in their K12 accounts through their Account Information screen. In addition, parents are allowed to review, edit, and delete information related to their child's K12 account at any time. 
<br><br>
If a parent chooses not to allow us to further collect or use their child's information, that parent can send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@K12.com">privacy@K12.com</a> to request that the child's account be deleted. 
<br><br>
Please note, however, that even after an account is deleted and the information in no longer in our active user databases, information about a child may remain in back-up storage for some time. 
<br><br>
