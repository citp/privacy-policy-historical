###  The Way decentral.tv Uses Information 

If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the decentral.tv Sites, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide you with the features and functionality of the decentral.tv Sites and Service. 

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your username (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos or send messages through the decentral.tv Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any content (text, pictures, graphics, photos, music, videos, etc) that you submit to the decentral.tv Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public. 

We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major decentral.tv Site and/or Service changes or for customer service purposes). 

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the decentral.tv Sites and Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends. 

We use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the decentral.tv Sites and Service; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. 

###  When decentral.tv Discloses Information 

We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy. 

We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. 

We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the decentral.tv Sites and Service. 

We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. 

decentral.tv also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that decentral.tv believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our website, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of decentral.tv, our Users or others. 

###  Your Choices 

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the decentral.tv Sites and Service, in which case decentral.tv may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the decentral.tv Sites and Service remain subject to our Terms of Service, even if you have deleted them from the pages associated with your account.

###  Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites 

decentral.tv allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the decentral.tv Sites and Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the decentral.tv Sites and Service. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. 

decentral.tv does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks decentral.tv to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the decentral.tv Sites and Service, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you. 

If you click on an advertisement, or click on a link that takes you to a website that is not operated by decentral.tv, you should familiarize yourself with the privacy practices of that advertiser or website. decentral.tv's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites. 

###  Our Commitment to Data Security 

decentral.tv uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to decentral.tv and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, decentral.tv makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

If decentral.tv learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. decentral.tv may post a notice on the decentral.tv Sites and Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using the [feedback form](https://web.archive.org/web/20090608192216id_/http%3A//www.kyte.tv/home/feedback.html). 

###  Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy 

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, decentral.tv does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the decentral.tv Sites and Service from persons under 14 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 14. If you are under 14 years of age, then please do not use or access the decentral.tv Sites at any time or in any manner. If decentral.tv learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 14 years of age has been collected on the decentral.tv Sites, then decentral.tv will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
