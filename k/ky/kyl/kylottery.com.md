### Privacy Statement

The Kentucky Lottery Corporation ("Kentucky Lottery") is strongly committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that is gathered from the use of its web site and web services. The following statement discloses the Kentucky Lottery's privacy policy, its information gathering/dissemination practices and answers some commonly asked privacy questions.

### What type of information does the Kentucky Lottery collect, and what's done with that information?

Like most websites, the Kentucky Lottery's website collects two types of information from web site users: anonymous information and personally identifiable information. "Anonymous information" refers to data that cannot be linked to a specific individual. Kentucky Lottery web servers log user hits, visits, sessions and service provider information. The statistics are compiled into website traffic reports, which help the Kentucky Lottery understand, anticipate, and respond to user behavior, and contributes to a better overall experience for website users.

Cookies are another type of anonymous information. A website cookie is a small text file that a web server places on a user's computer that the server can have read back to it at a later time. When accessing a cookie, a web server reads information that it originally wrote in the cookie, but it is unable to determine any data about the user or their PC. You can set your browser to warn you when placement of a cookie is requested, and decide whether or not to accept it. By rejecting a cookie, some features or services available on the site may not function properly. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable the Site to relate your use of the Site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to the Site.

"Personally identifiable information" refers to data on specific individuals who have volunteered information on Kentucky Lottery's site through the completion of an online survey. This survey information includes name, physical address, e-mail address, age, sex and phone number. The personal information is gathered as part of the Kentucky Lottery's Player's Fun Club prize drawing. This is a once a week drawing available only to those individuals who complete the Player's Fun Club survey. The winners are notified by email or telephone before the prize package is mailed to confirm eligibility. Personally identifiable information will be used by the Kentucky Lottery only on a need-to-know basis, and will not be made accessible to unauthorized employees at any time.

The survey information is used to evaluate the types of lottery games enjoyed by the survey respondents, and assists the Kentucky Lottery in developing the products offered to the public.

### Does the Kentucky Lottery share the information with anyone?

The Kentucky Lottery will not release personal information to third parties except where it is already provided by law. State law restricts the use of personally identifiable information for commercial purposes. Depending on the specific nature of the service, information may be shared with other state agencies as stated in KRS 61.878 (5). This statute allows for the exchange of public records or sharing of information between public agencies when the exchange is serving a legitimate governmental need or is necessary in the performance of a legitimate government function. Kentucky Lottery retains the right to release private information in rare cases we believe to be emergencies.

The Kentucky Lottery will not share personal information with any private party, except as required by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the Kentucky Open Records laws found at KRS 61.870 - KRS 61.884.

### Contacting the Kentucky Lottery Corporation About This Website

The viewer should return to the site on a routine basis, due to the changes in the type of information gathered or the uses made of that information. If you are concerned about how information about you may have been used in connection with this web site, or you have questions about the Kentucky Lottery's privacy policy and information practices you should contact:
