### 1\. Introduction

Kueez Entertainment Ltd. (" **Kueez** ", " **we** ", " **our** " or " **us** ") develops, publishes and operates leisure and social games and applications (" **Games** "). We also operate the website www.kueez.com, its subdomains and its related features (" **Site** ", and together with the Games, collectively – the " **Services** ").

We are strongly committed to making our Privacy practices more transparent and fair. This Privacy Notice describes how we collect, store, use and disclose personal data regarding individuals who visit our Site or play our Games (" **you** "), and it applies whenever you visit our Services or play our Games, interact with us or otherwise access or use any of our Services.

Specifically, it describes the personal data we typically receive or collect, how and for which purposes we may use such data (including for tracking and advertising), where we store and for how long we retain it, with whom we may share it, our use of communications, our security practices, your choices and rights regarding such data, our policy concerning children, and how to contact us if you have any concerns regarding your Privacy or this Notice.

**We strongly urge you to read this Notice and make sure that you fully understand and agree to it. If you do not agree to this Notice, please discontinue and avoid using our Services.**

You are **_not_** legally required to provide us with any Personal Data, but without it we will not be able to provide you with the full range or with the best experience of using our Services (for instance, you may still play most of our Games without connecting your Facebook account, but you will not be able to fully enjoy their social features).

### 2\. Data Collection

We collect four main categories of data (and to the extent it may enable the identification of a specific person, or is linked to such potentially identifying data, we will deem it as " **Personal Data** "): 

  1. **Data automatically collected or generated** : when someone visits, interacts with or uses our Services, including any e-mail or text messages sent to them by us or via our Services, we may collect or generate technical data about them. We collect or generate such data either independently or with the help of third party services (as detailed in Sections 4 and 6 below), including through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies (as further detailed in Section 7 below).



Such data consists of connectivity, technical or aggregated usage data, such as IP address, non-identifying data regarding the device, operating system, browser version locale and language settings used, the cookies and pixels installed on such device, and the activity (clicks and other interactions) of users of our Services, as well as any in-Game events.

 

We do not use such data to learn a person's true identity or contact details, but mostly to have a better understanding on how our users typically use and engage with our Services. The use of such technical and device data also helps us and our partners to deliver contextual or otherwise more effective advertisements and content; to optimize our ad management and our users' viewing experience, and to improve the overall user experience and performance of our Services. For more information about our advertising uses, please see Section 4 below.  
 

  1. **Data received from you:** you may provide us Personal Data voluntarily, such as your name, e-mail address and company name when you contact us (through Facebook, Messenger, the "Contact" form on the Site, e-mail or any other channel), your images and profile pictures (if you choose to upload them to the Game), when you post on our public forums or groups, when you sign-up to receive e-mail updates, when you place any purchases via our Services, or when you choose to connect your Facebook account to any of our Games.

 
  1. **Data received from Facebook and other channels** : Once you connect any of our Games to your Facebook account, we will receive access to your Facebook public profile. Such access will allow us to collect the following parameters (to the extent you defined them as "public", or specifically permitted the Game to access it): your full name, e-mail address, profile picture, Facebook User ID (generated for the specific Game), gender, date of birth, list of friends (and their public profile pictures), posts, photos, comments, tags and tagged pictures, locale and time zone.



In addition, we or our advertising partners may receive from Facebook and our other marketing channels general information concerning the performance of our advertising campaigns, such as the targeted age group or interests, and we or our partners may be able to link such general data to any other data in our possession (to learn more about our advertising practices, please read Section 4 below).  
 

  1. **Data generated by us:** Some of our Games include the generation of new data or content, such as rendered versions of the images or content you submit or that is otherwise collected via the Game. For example, we may generate a rendition of your submitted profile picture, which depicts an altered version of yourself or any of your friends.

 
  1. **Transaction Data** : Some of our Games allow you to place purchases, such as for ordering a print of the image rendition generated through your use of our Games. As part of the purchase process you will be required to provide certain billing and shipping information. Such information will be collected and processed by the relevant Service Provider that manages our online store and order shipping process (as noted on the purchase page). We will not collect or store your financial data, e.g. your credit card numbers or bank account. We may still however receive your non-financial Personal Data related to your order, such as your name, billing and shipping address, e-mail address and the items purchased, in order to fulfil your purchase and for our accounting purposes.

 

### 3\. Data Uses

We will use your Personal Data as necessary for the performance of our Services; for complying with applicable law; and based on our legitimate interests in maintaining and improving our Services and offerings, understanding how our Services are used, serving effective advertisements within our Games and through other channels, improving our customer service and support operations, and protecting and securing our users, ourselves and our Services.

Accordingly, we use Personal Data for the following purposes: 

  1. To facilitate, operate, and provide our Services;
  2. To authenticate the identity of our players, and allow them access to additional features;
  3. To provide our users with customer care, assistance and technical support services;

### 4\. Cookies, Tracking and Advertising Uses

Our Services and some of our Service Providers utilize “cookies”, anonymous identifiers and other tracking technologies which help us provide and improve our Services, personalize your experience and monitor the performance of our activities and campaigns, as well as the usage of our Services as a whole. A “cookie” is a small text file that is used, for example, to collect data about activity on our Site. Some cookies and other technologies serve to recall Personal Data, such as an IP address, previously indicated by the user.

A list of the cookies we use can be found here.  

Our Services also utilize advertising for third party services and products. We and our advertising partners use certain data about you in order to improve our advertising practices and make the ads we deliver more effective, relevant and enjoyable, including by deploying contextual and interest-based advertising, as well as targeting, ad measurement and attribution systems. The ads we or our advertising partners deliver may be shown within our Games, our Services, or through other channels, such as third party websites and applications.

Such data includes your IP address, cookies, pixels and other unique identifiers, data related to your connected Facebook profile (if any, such as your gender, age group, region or country), and other demographic and interests-based information that we or our advertising partners may have received from or about you, based on your consent or another legal basis (i.e., as required in order to provide you with our respective services, or based on the legitimate interests that we described in Section 3 above). Please note that we **do not** share the data you provide us through your connected Facebook account with our advertising partners.

Please note that this Privacy Notice does not apply to the processing of your data by our advertising partners and networks. We recommend that you review their privacy policies for more information (a list of our advertising partners and networks and their policies can be found here). (CHECK LAST PAGE)

**How to adjust your preferences regarding cookies and interest-based advertising**  
While we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from a browser, most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.

If you wish to prevent the use of your identifiers for interest-based advertising, you may change your browser settings to reset or block cookies (typically, this is available under the "Settings" or "Help" section in your browser menu).

If you live in the USA, Canada or Europe, you can also opt-out from the collection of your data by our advertising partners who participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance, by visiting [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) (for US users), [www.youradchoices.ca/choices](http://www.youradchoices.ca/choices) (for Canadian users) or [www.yourchoicesonline.com](http://www.yourchoicesonline.com/) (for European users).

Please note that if you reset your cookies or opt-out of interest based advertising, you may still see advertisements in our Services, or on any other channels, but those ads will not be targeted based on the above mentioned identifiers. For example, such ads may be instead based on context, such as your activity in our Games or Services, or your language preferences. Please note that such actions may result in a less enjoyable user experience.
