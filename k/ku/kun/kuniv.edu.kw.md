(None)
2.6 Policy Statements
2.6.1 Internet Security Policies
2.6.1.1 Reliance of Information downloaded from the Internet
2.6.1.1.1 Information taken from the Internet should not be relied on until confirmed
           by separate information from another source.
There is no quality control process on the Internet, and a considerable amount
of its information is outdated or inaccurate. Unless tools and solutions like
Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), and Public Key
Infrastructures (PKI - certificate authority based solutions) are used, it is also
relatively easy to spoof another user on the Internet.
2.6.1.2 Release of KUWAIT UNIVERSITY Information on the Internet
2.6.1.2.1 Users should not release any KUWAIT UNIVERSITY information over the
           Internet. Further, users should not place KUWAIT UNIVERSITY material
           (software, internal memos, etc.) on any publicly accessible Internet
           computer.
2.6.1.2.2 Web page content should be in accordance with specific company directives,
           and the page layout must follow the policies/guidelines defined by Manager
           Information Security
KUWAIT UNIVERSITY © 2015                                                            15


2.6.2 Information Protection
2.6.2.1 KUWAIT UNIVERSITY’s sensitive and confidential information should
        never be sent over the Internet unless it has first been encrypted by
        approved methods.
2.6.2.2 Unless specifically known to be in the public domain, source code should
        always be encrypted before being sent over the Internet.
2.6.2.3 Credit card numbers, telephone calling card numbers, login passwords,
        and other parameters that can be used to gain access to goods or
        services, should not be sent over the Internet in readable form. An
        encryption algorithm approved by Manager Information Security should
        be used to protect these parameters as they traverse the Internet.
2.6.2.4 Reporting Security Problems
2.6.2.4.1 Each user has the responsibility to notify the Line manager, IS Helpdesk, who
          in turn will notify the Manager Information Security immediately of any
          evidence of any security violation involving Internet connectivity in regard to:
      Unauthorized access to network, telecommunications, or computer
       systems;
      Apparent transmittal of a virus or worm via networking technologies; and
      Apparent tampering with any file for which the user established restrictive
       discretionary access controls.

              conduct still apply.
2.6.5.1.3 Any use of E-Mail from the network is easily traceable to KUWAIT
          UNIVERSITY. Personnel should conduct these activities with the reputation of
          KUWAIT UNIVERSITY in mind. Staff should exercise the same care in drafting
