# Inbound Marketing Agency Privacy Policy

#### We recognize that privacy and confidentiality are important to our clients. This page describes in detail the privacy practices that apply for all of our inbound marketing services.

### Confidentiality

All of all clients records are considered confidential. Strategies, documents, graphic concepts, proposals and related materials are not considered public information. Design work for completed projects may be displayed only as examples of work either on our web site or in printed form.

### Personal information and other data we collect

We collect personal information when you register to request information about our inbound marketing services, buy one or more products, schedule an event or otherwise voluntarily provide such information. We use cookies and other technologies to enhance your online experience by eliminating the need to register multiple times for registration-required content. In the interest of providing our visitors and customers with a secure online experience, our servers automatically record information when you visit our website, including the URL, IP address, browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.

### Uses

We may use personal information to provide the inbound marketing services you've requested, including communicating with you about technical issues, new products and services, and other information of interest to you. Our registration forms always enable you to "opt-out" from receiving e-mail from us unless specifically requested. We may also use personal information for auditing, research and analysis to operate and improve our inbound marketing technologies and services. We may also share information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services. We process all personal information on our servers in the United States of America.

### Your Choices

We offer you choices when we ask for personal information, whenever reasonably possible. You may decline to provide personal information to us in our registration forms and/or refuse cookies in your browser, although some of our features or services may not function properly as a result. We make good faith efforts to provide you access to your personal information upon request and to let you correct such data if it is inaccurate and delete it, when reasonably possible.

### Our Customers

Our subscription based service sometimes includes hosting customers' web sites that were built using KunoCMS or other content management systems. Kuno Creative Group is not responsible for posting and/or enforcing our customers' privacy policies. Our [terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/termsandconditions/ "terms and conditions") explicitly define our relationship, responsibilities, and liabilities with respect to privacy and security. While we are in no way responsible or liable for the collection and use of personal information by our customers from their Web sites or during application of our inbound marketing services, we will make every reasonable effort to ensure that our customers post and enforce their privacy policies.

### California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

### Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act), we do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.
