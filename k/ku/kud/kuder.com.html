	<em>Collection of Personal Information from Children Under 13</em>
</h3>
	<p>This web site complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). Accordingly, Kuder
	 does not knowingly collect personal information directly from any child under 13 years of age, without either
	 (1) the authorization of the child's parent or guardian, or (2) authorization from the school where the child
	 is enrolled as a student, wherein such authorization designates Kuder to act as an agent of the school for the
	 collection of a child's personal information for the use and benefit of the school, and the school has warranted
	 to Kuder that it has obtained any consent of the child's parent or guardian necessary to comply with COPPA.
	 Such authorization is granted through the school's acceptance of Kuder's KCPS Terms and Conditions of Restricted
	 Use License or another agreement executed by both Kuder and the particular school.</p>
	 <p>With respect to students under the age of 13, access by a third party to the data collection aspects of and
	 the personal information collected through this Web Site is made available only to a student’s Authorized Educational
	 Institution and, if applicable, any Jointly Administering Educational Institutions or Agencies (as those terms are
	 defined below under “Use of Personal Information of Children Under 13”). Such Authorized Educational Institutions and, if
	 applicable, Jointly Administering Educational Institutions or Agencies obtain such access only through their acceptance
	 of Kuder's KCPS Terms and Conditions of Restricted Use License or another agreement executed by both Kuder and the
	 particular entity. Accordingly, each Authorized Educational Institution and, if applicable, any Jointly Administering
	 Educational Institution or Agency utilizing the personal information collected by this Web Site has: (a) acknowledged that
	 Kuder is acting as an agent of the Authorized Educational Institution  in the collection of data from students under the
	 age of 13, and (b) warranted that its use of such data will at all times comply with the Children's Online Privacy
	 Protection Act of 1998.</p>
	 <p>There may be instances where a child under the age of 13 desires to directly register to use this Web Site and a school
	 at which the child is enrolled has not contracted with Kuder to act as an agent for the collection of personal information
	 from the child as set forth above. IN SUCH INSTANCES, CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE MAY NOT REGISTER TO USE THIS WEB SITE
	 WITHOUT KUDER FIRST RECEIVING AUTHORIZATION FROM A PARENT OR GUARDIAN.  Parents of children under the age of 13 desiring
	 to directly register to use this Web Site should contact Kuder's Webmaster regarding the procedures for providing appropriate
	 parental consent by written communication to Kuder, Inc., Attn: Ed Harrington, 302 Visions Parkway, Adel, Iowa, 50003, via
	 telephone at (800) 314-8972, or via email at harringtone@kuder.com.</p>
	 <p>If Kuder receives a direct request from a child under 13 to use the Web Site, and Kuder has not received authorization
	 from a parent or guardian, Kuder will utilize the child's information solely for a one-time response to the child.</p>
	 <p>Kuder also encourages parents to counsel their children regarding providing information online and to supervise their
	 online activities.</p>
