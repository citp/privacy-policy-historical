In addition, the purpose of the data processing regards the collection, storage and processing of the User’s personal data to perform statistical analysis in an anonymous and/or aggregate form, without the ability of identifying the User and only to verify the quality of the Services offered. Finally, the optional, explicit and voluntary sending of electronic mail to the addresses indicated on this Site, entails the subsequent acquisition of the sender’s email address, which is required in order to respond to requests, as well as any other personal data included in the email. Any specific information will be progressively reported or displayed in the web pages designated for special services, on request.<br> <strong><br>Method of Data Processing&nbsp;<br></strong>Your personal data are processed by automated tools for the exact amount of time required to achieve the purposes for which they were collected.

Absence of these data can make it impossible to obtain the requested Service.<br> <strong><br>Navigation Data</strong> <br>The electronic communication networks and the software that run the Site, acquire some personal data over time and the transmission of such data is implicit in the Internet protocols that are used. This information is not collected for the purpose of being associated with identified data subjects; however, because of the nature of the data, through elaborations and associations with data from third parties, the Information may allow Users to be identified.&nbsp;<br>This category of data includes IP addresses or domain names of computers used by Users to connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) notation of the resources requested, the hour the request was made, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numeric code identifying the status of the response given by the server (okay, error, etc.) and other parameters regarding the operating system and the computer operating environment of the User.&nbsp; These data are used exclusively for the purpose of drawing up anonymous statistical information on the use of the Site, as well as to ensure that the Site is working properly. These data are immediately cancelled once they have been elaborated. The data may be used to verify responsibility in the event of any offenses to the Site or a third party: with the exception of this possibility, web contact data are not currently saved in a permanent way.&nbsp;<br>With reference to the User’s use of cookies or permanent tracking/monitoring systems, access to the Site may involve sending - from the server to the User's PC terminal - text files to obtain information about the User’s navigation on the Site. Pursuant to art. 122 of the Data Protection Code, the sending of non-permanent cookies is required to allow the operation of certain parts of the Service that require the identification of the user path through the various pages of the Site. For any access to the Site, regardless of the presence of a cookie, the following information is recorded: type of browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome), operating system (e.g. Windows, MacOS), the User’s host and URL source, in addition to data on the requested page. These data may be used in an aggregate and anonymous form to create a statistical analysis of the use of the Site. Finally, the use of C.D. session cookies (which are not permanently stored on the User's computer and disappear when the browser is closed) is strictly limited to transmitting session identifiers (consisting of random numbers generated by the server), necessary to permit secure and efficient exploration of the Site.&nbsp;<br>The cookies can be simply and easily disabled by working through the configuration options on the User’s browser.<br><br><strong><a id="readcookie" name="readcookie"></a>Cookies and their use</strong>&nbsp;<br>Cookies are small text files that are used to obtain information about navigation on our Site. Following is detailed information regarding the cookies on this site and how they work. The User is free to accept or decline the sending of all or some of our cookies to his/her computer. Please keep in mind that some cookies must be sent from our server in order for certain parts of the Service to work, specifically parts of the Service that require the identification of the User’s path through the different pages of the Site. For this reason, in the absence of such cookies, it may not be possible to use the Site. If the User agrees to receive cookies from Kuidle, the User may at any time change his/her mind; all or some of the cookies can be easily disable in the User’s browser configurations.
