# About Kuoni Travel - privacy policy statement

**We respect the privacy of our customers therefore we are committed to the following privacy policy, which is designed to give you peace of mind and confidence.**

**What personal information do we ask for?**  
Whether you are booking a holiday, requesting a brochure, or joining our Online Travel Club, we will ask for your name, your postal address, your telephone and fax number and e-mail address. 

If you are booking your holiday online, we'll also need your credit/debit card details (including card number, cardholder name, expiry date and start date for Mastercard) in order to take payment and confirm the booking on-line. If you're paying by debit card we may also need to take the start date and issue number of the card.

**How does Kuoni Travel use this personal information?  
Brochure Requests, and Online Travel Club:  
**We need your name, address and/or e-mail address so that we can send out your brochure order, and/or advise you of special offers/promotions we think you would be interested in. On all forms you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving occasional marketing information from Kuoni. **

If your email or address details have changed or you no longer require Kuoni marketing information please send your existing and new contact to:[changes@kuoni.co.uk](mailto:changes@kuoni.co.uk).

**

**Online Bookings:**  
We need your name so we can confirm these details to the relevant hotels, airlines etc. who the booking is for.

We also need your address so that we can send you a confirmation invoice as well as your travel documents and in case we have to write to you about any part of your booking in advance of your holiday. 

We would need your telephone number and e-mail address in the unlikely event that we need to contact you urgently about your booking. 

We may also use this information to let you know about any special offers/promotions we think would be of interest to you.

You will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such information on the booking form.

We may also use your IP (Internet Protocol) address to diagnose problems with our server and administer the site - monitoring visitor traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop and improve the Kuoni Travel site further.

We need your credit card details so that we can collect payment for your booking. 

Information you supply to us will be passed to our suppliers (such as airlines, hotels, transport companies) and agents only where necessary for the purposes of booking your holiday. This may include the transfer of information outside the EEA (European Economic Area).

**How does Kuoni Travel protect customer information?**  
All the information you give us is protected by a secure server. The secure server software SSL (Secure Socket Layers) encrypts all information you enter before it is sent to us. The information is only de-encrypted when it reaches our server.

We also have a Firewall (security software) in place to protect our internal information from the Internet.

****Does the Kuoni Travel site use cookies?****  
Yes, the Kuoni Travel websites uses cookies. These cookies are only used to recognise repeat visitors and to facilitate the brochure request process. Cookies used can not be used to trace visitor behaviour across other websites.

 (A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store on a web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. This is useful for having the browser remember some specific information (ref. Cookie Central)).

**Will Kuoni Travel disclose any of this personal information to third parties?**  
Kuoni Travel will only disclose your name and booking details to our suppliers for operational purposes. We will not pass on your details to other companies for marketing purposes.

We won't disclose credit/debit card numbers unless we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

**Will Kuoni Travel use the information I give for direct mailings?**  
Yes, but only on a small scale and we try to make sure they only contain information you wouldn't want to miss! If you find that you'd rather not have any contact with us, apart from that which is necessary for us to give you our normal level of service either use the opt-out boxes on the online registration/booking form or alternatively, please write to us at the address below. 

If you have any questions relating to our privacy policy, or, if at any time you believe that Kuoni Travel has not adhered to this privacy policy please let us know by sending an e-mail to [webmaster@kuoni.co.uk](mailto:webmaster@kuoni.co.uk). Alternatively write to us at New Media Marketing, Kuoni Travel, Kuoni House, Deepdene Ave, DORKING, Surrey RH5 4AZ.
