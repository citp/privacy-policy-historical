The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for KnowThis.com, a service operated by KnowThis LLC ("KnowThis"). KnowThis is strongly committed to maintaining the high standards of privacy for all users of our service. 

**USER PROVIDED INFORMATION**  
KnowThis does not sell or make available for rental to third parties any information provided by its users. 

KnowThis requires users of certain services, including the online Marketing Forums, to provide certain information as part of the registration process for gaining access to the service.  Anyone registering must provide a username, password and email address.  If a service requires payment, all payment related information is handled by a third-party payment processor.  Payment information is transmitted through Secure Socket Layer technology throughout the entire purchase process to protect users. Credit card information is not captured by KnowThis nor is it stored on this site.

For services requiring registration, information such as email address, may be used to provide communication between registered users and KnowThis such as confirming your registration, providing reminders of registration or payment status, offering service renewal notices, occasionally sending updated information about KnowThis, and sending requests for feedback that are designed to improve the services provided by KnowThis.  Because this information is vital to operating certain services offered by KnowThis, an opt-out option for communication from KnowThis may not be available to users.

For certain services offered by KnowThis, including the online Marketing Forums, registered members have the option to have their email address be viewable to other members.  Additionally, registered members of the Marketing Forums may elect to provide additional personal and professional information.  If a member elects to provide this information it may be viewable to other members.

KnowThis may use the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Additionally, we may track user activity, via server logs and search box entries, on an aggregated basis in order to understand general user trends which is designed to help us improve user’s experience with KnowThis.  Certain services offered by KnowThis, including the online Marketing Forums, may track activity of individual members such as time of login, length of visit and activity on the site (e.g., recent posts to forums).  KnowThis will only use the user’s individual activity within an offered service in situations that requires maintaining quality of service levels (e.g., service access problems) and to identify and protect from potential service violators.

**COOKIES**  
KnowThis utilizes session cookies which are set to expire after a user's session has ended.  These cookies are used to improve the user's interaction with the site but are not used to gather user information.  KnowThis also uses permanent cookies that are necessary for the proper operation of our website metrics and site traffic reports supplied by Google Analytics.  This information is collected anonymously and the analytics program only looks at the collective users’ experience.  Note that permanent cookies can be removed by the user through their browser's preference or options area.
