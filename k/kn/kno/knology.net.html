Knology  believes the protection of your privacy is one of the most important  responsibilities we have. This Policy explains how the information you may  supply to us through the Knology web site will be used. If any changes are made  to this Policy, they will be posted on the Knology web site. Please read this  Policy carefully so that you understand our privacy and security policies. Your  use of the Knology web site constitutes your agreement to the terms of the  Policy. If you have questions about this Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@knology.com">info@knology.com</a> or write to us at 1241 O.G. Skinner Drive, West Point, GA, 31833. </font></p><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2">
<p><br>
  Knology web  site means knology.com, knology.net, and any other knology.com promotional web  sites.</p>
<p><br>
  We, our, and  us mean Knology, Inc. and all of its subsidiary and affiliated entities,  including Knology. </p>
<p><br>
  When we use  the words "you" and "your" we mean customers who have a  continuing relationship with us, such as:</p>
  Individuals  viewing our websites.<br>
  Individuals contacting us by completing an on-line form on the Knology web  site. <br>
  <br><br>
  <strong>Terms used in this Policy are: </strong><strong><br>
        </strong>Nonpublic personal information means information about you that we collect  in connection with providing Knology services to you. Nonpublic personal  information does not include information that is available from public sources,  such as telephone directories. Hereafter, we will use the term  "information" to mean nonpublic personal information as defined in  this section.
<br><br>
  An affiliate  is a company we own or control, a company that owns or controls us, or a  company that is owned or controlled by the same company that owns or controls  us. <br><br>
  A  nonaffiliated third party is a person we do not employ or a company that is not  an affiliate of ours. This is also known as nonaffiliated third party, or  simply, an "other party." <p></p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Information  You Provide to Us:</strong><strong><br>
  </strong>You  may provide public and nonpublic personal information, including your name,  postal address, email address, and telephone number when you submit information  via on-line forms on the Knology web site. We restrict access to nonpublic  personal information about you to those employees who need to know that  information to provide services to you. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Information  Collected Through Technology:</strong><strong><br>
  </strong>We  collect information through technology to make our sites more interesting and  useful to you. For example, when you come to the Knology web site, we collect  your IP address. An IP address is often associated with the portal through  which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your  company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally  identifiable. Your IP address allows us to track the pages you've visited. We  aggregate this data with data from the pages visited by other users to track  overall visitor traffic patterns. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Browsing  on our Web Site:</strong><br>
If you  browse through the Knology web site without entering any personal data, we will  gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does  not identify you personally and cannot be linked back to you unless you decide  at some point to identify yourself. <br><br>
  If you are  only browsing, we collect the following information: IP address, the date and  time you access our site, and the pages you visit (click-through).</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Provision and Transmission of Information</strong>:<br>
  We will not read Your outgoing or incoming e-mail, video mail, private  chat, or instant messages, but we (or our third party providers) do store  e-mail messages and video mail messages on computer systems for a period of  time. We could be required to disclose these messages and communications along  with other personally identifiable information about You to comply with law or  to protect our Service as described in the Knology Acceptable Use Policy and  the Knology Customer Service Agreement, both of which can be found at <a href="http://www.knology.com/about/legal.cfm">http://www.knology.com/about/legal.cfm</a>.&nbsp; We also monitor the performance of our  Service and Your Service connection in order to manage, maintain, and improve  the Service and Your connection to it. We (or our third party providers) use  tools to help prevent and block "spam" e-mails, viruses, spyware, and  other harmful or unwanted communications and programs on the Service. These  tools may automatically scan Your e-mails, video mails, instant messages, file  attachments, and other files and communications in order to help us protect You  and the Service against these harmful or unwanted communications and programs.  However, these tools do not collect or disclose personally identifiable  information about You. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Information You Provide  to Non-Affiliated Third Parties:</strong><br>
  You should also be aware that any personally identifiable information You  provide in publicly accessible services or websites, including but not limited  to, forums, chat areas, instant message services, or bulletin boards may be  read, collected, and used by others who access those services. We are not  responsible for any personally identifiable information You choose to submit in  forums, chat areas, instant message services, bulletin boards, or any other  publicly accessible service or website, even when such site was accessed or  linked to by You through Knology’s website.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Children  Under 13:</strong><strong><br>
    </strong>The  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we  inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose  personal information from children under 13 years of age and that we obtain the  consent of parents and guardians in order for children to use certain features  of the Knology web site. <br><br>
  Children can  surf www.Knology.com and view content without any personal information being  collected. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children <br><br>
  We may amend  our Privacy Policy at any time. At all times, parents should update their  personal information to provide us current email addresses. We will apply  material changes in our Privacy Policy only in conformance with applicable law,  including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>E-Mail  Addresses:</strong><strong><br>
        </strong>E-mail  addresses will not be sold or distributed to any non-affiliated third party,  with the exception that Knology may contract with non-affiliated third parties  to distribute Knology emails related to new features, offers, promotions, etc.  The Knology web site uses e-mail addresses to uniquely identify users of our  service. Knology may use your e-mail address to contact you regarding new  features or other service related notices and may do so by contracting with  non-affiliated third parties. <br><br>
  We reserve the  right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if  there has been a violation of the Knology Terms and Conditions of Service. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Your  Information and Other Parties:</strong><strong><br>
                  </strong>We  will not disclose information about you to anyone except as disclosed in this  Policy or as permitted by law. If requested by law enforcement or judicial  authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate  documentation. Knology may also provide information to law enforcement to  protect its property and the health and safety of individuals as permitted by  statute. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Security:</strong><strong><br>
                                              </strong>Information  gathered by Knology on the web site is stored within Knology controlled  databases on servers maintained in protected environments. Our security and  privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only  authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. <br><br>
  However, no  physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. As a result, while we  strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security  of our servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply  won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet, and you  use these services at your own risk. </p>
<p><br>
