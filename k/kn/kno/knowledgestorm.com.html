<h2><a name="KeyDefinitions" id="KeyDefinitions"></a>Key Definitions </h2>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, we use the following key definitions (other terms are defined in the body of the Policy):</p>
<p>“Clickstream Data” means a record of any TechTarget content viewed by you, including your clicks on links to content on TechTarget Sites, and your search queries on TechTarget sites.  It is the virtual trail that a User leaves behind when accessing the websites.   A clickstream is a record of a User's activity on our websites and every page the User visits, how long the User was on a page or site, in what order the pages were visited, any newsgroups that the User participates in or any comments made on the site.</p>
<p>“Co-Branded Site” means a website hosted by a third party business partner of TechTarget, the content and branding of which is shared with that third party business partner under contractual obligations between TechTarget and our partner.</p>
<p>“Content” means a white paper, analyst report, webcast, videocast, newsletter, software demo, web page or other document or media presentation that is linked to or displayed on a Site.</p>
<p>“Data Subscription Service” means the license that TechTarget grants to its customers to use our Clickstream and Member Data.</p>
<p>“Member” means a User that (i) registers on one of the Sites to become a member of that Site, (ii) subscribes to a newsletter on one of the Sites or (iii) accesses demos, brochures or other product information on or from a Site.</p>
<p>“Member Information” means information which you provide TechTarget which may include, but shall not be limited to your name and corporate title, the name of your company and the department in which you work, your industry group, country, zip code, telephone number, information about software or hardware your company is using, plans your company may have to purchase additional information technology, as well as any Clickstream Data or Supplementary Information (as defined below) that is subsequently appended to your Member Information, as well as any additional information supplied by you in the process of submitting a registration form.</p>
<p>“Service Provider” means a company that provides services to TechTarget with regard to the operation of its websites or the collection/review of data from the TechTarget websites.</p>
<p>“Sites” “TechTarget Site” or “Websites” means the network of websites owned and operated by TechTarget, including bitpipe.com, knowledgestorm.com and the TechnologyGuide.com sites. For purposes hereof, Co-Branded Sites shall be included in the definition of “Sites” and “Websites” except as expressly otherwise provided for herein.</p>
<p>“Sponsor” means a third party that owns or sponsors Content on a Site or that subscribes to TechTarget’s Data Subscription Service.</p>
<p>“Supplementary Information” means publicly available information or information that is made available by third parties that TechTarget may use to supplement Member Information.  For example, if a Member provides the name of the company where he or she works, TechTarget may obtain information that is publicly available, or through a paid third party service, regarding the company’s number of employees and annual revenue.</p>
<p> “Tracking Technology” means Cookies, Clear GIFs, serving tracking technologies or other technology solutions performing similar functions that are used by TechTarget.<br>
  “User” or “you” means any person viewing any page of any of the Sites. A User need not be a Member.<br>
</p>


<h2><a name="PrivacyPolicy" id="PrivacyPolicy"></a>This Privacy Policy Does Not Apply To Third Party Websites</h2>

<p>Some Content made available through the Sites is maintained on the website of the Content Sponsor, and not on a TechTarget Site. This means that when you are on a TechTarget Site and click through to that Content, you may be leaving the TechTarget Site and, in some cases, will be redirected to the site of the Content Sponsor and subject to the policies of that Content Sponsor. TechTarget Sites also feature ads from third parties (“Advertisers”); when you click on an ad, you will be leaving the TechTarget network of Sites and will be redirected to the Advertiser’s site and subject to the policies of that Advertiser. It should be clear to you when either of these site transfers occur as the “look and feel” of your web page will change, and the URL will no longer refer to the URL of a TechTarget Site. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use of, or disclosure of any information you choose to disclose to the Advertiser or Content Sponsor on, the Advertiser or Content Sponsor site.</p>


<h2><a name="WhatInformationDoWeCollect" id="WhatInformationDoWeCollect"></a>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

<p><strong>Member  Information:</strong> A TechTarget  goal in collecting Member Information is to provide you with the best and most  useful content and services, and to offer you opportunities to obtain other  products and services from us and our partners. Because we derive revenue from  advertising, collecting information is essential to keeping our services  available to users. We collect Member Information when you provide it to us  through the following: when you register on one of our Sites, subscribe to an  e-mail newsletter, register for one of our events or access certain Content or  through surveys, as well as when you register to receive a demonstration or  “test-drive” software products. Several of the services that we offer on our  Sites may require registration as a condition of use. Once you register with  one of the TechTarget Sites, you are no longer anonymous to us. To the extent  that we combine any Clickstream Data or Supplementary Information with the  information provided by you, it will be considered to be part of your Member  Information.</p>
<p><strong>Clickstream  Data:</strong> When you access  a Site, a small file called a “cookie” is placed on your hard drive. If you  register as a Member, TechTarget will use cookies to authenticate your identity  when you visit the Sites, collect the data generated in connection with your  clickstream activity on the Sites and to personalize your user experience on  the Sites, including by serving and managing ads based on your activity on the  Sites. In all cases, TechTarget uses cookies to track the Clickstream Data of  Members on the Sites and to obtain non-personally identifiable information from  Users, such as the number of visits to the Sites that a certain User has made,  the movement of the User through the Sites, and the searches that the User  conducts on the Sites. Please note that TechTarget does not collect Clickstream  Data on any websites other than the Sites. Most browsers are initially set up  to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to  indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some TechTarget features and  services may not be available to you if your cookies are disabled. We use  electronic images known as "clear GIFs" (sometimes called  "transparent GIFs", "Web bugs", “pixel tags” or  "beacons") that allow us to track general user traffic patterns.  TechTarget also automatically receives and records information from our servers  and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information  about the page you accessed. Although our Sites currently do not  respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through these  third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed in the section  entitled<strong><em> Analytics and Online Behavioral Advertising</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Third  Party Clickstream Data:</strong> When  you visit the Sites, we may also allow our third party partners to place their  own cookies on your computer in order to serve you with relevant advertising  online. This third party cookie may transfer non-personally identifiable  information to the third party partner in order for them to track your activity  when you visit the Sites and on sites outside the TechTarget network for  purposes of serving you ads on topics in which you have a demonstrated interest  based on your Clickstream Data; please note that we do not share any personally  identifiable Member Information with these third parties and we can only access  cookies that we set on your computer, not the cookies sent to you by other  companies. Also, when you leave the TechTarget network of Sites by clicking on  Sponsored Content or advertising, these third parties may place cookies or  clear GIFs on your computer. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use and  disclosure of any information collected by third parties, such as through  cookies or clear GIFs, when you visit their web sites or by third parties  regarding your clickstream activity on sites other than TechTarget’s network of  Sites.</p>
<p>In addition to the  disclosure to third parties as described above, TechTarget has contractual  arrangements with certain Service Providers under which these Service Providers  agree not to disclose any information we provide to them. For the purpose  of this Privacy Policy, the Service Provider is to be considered to be the same  as TechTarget.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics  and Online Behavioral Advertising:</strong> We partner with certain third parties to collect the  non-personal information discussed above and to engage in analysis, auditing,  research, and reporting. These third parties may use web logs or web beacons,  and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In particular,  the Sites use<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html"><strong> Google  Analytics </strong></a>to help collect  and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed above. You may opt  out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The Sites also enable  third-party tracking mechanisms to collect your non-personal information for  use in online behavioral advertising. For example, third parties may use the  fact that you visited the Sites to target online ads for TechTarget to you on  non-TechTarget websites. In addition, our third-party advertising networks  might use information about your use of the Sites to help target specific  technology-related or other non-TechTarget advertisements to you based on your  online behavior. For information about behavioral advertising practices,  including privacy and confidentiality, visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising"><strong>Network Advertising Initiative website</strong></a> or the<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/"><strong> Digital Advertising  Alliance website</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The use of online  tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties’ own  privacy policies, and not this Policy. If you prefer to prevent third parties  from setting and accessing cookies on your computer, you may set your browser  to block cookies. Additionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted  advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"><strong>opting  out here</strong></a>, or of companies  participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance program by<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices"><strong> opting out here</strong></a>. Although our Sites currently do not respond  to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through these  third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed above.</p>
<p><strong>Event  Registration Information:</strong> When you register on a Site to attend a TechTarget in person  event, the registration form requires Users to provide information such as your  name and corporate title, company name, address, telephone, email address  and/or additional information, including information about software or hardware  your company is using, plans your company may have to purchase additional  information technology, etc. (“Event Registration Information”).</p>
<p><strong>Third  Party Personal Information: </strong>The Sites include an “email a friend” feature, which allows a  User to email Content to a third party; we only use the email address of that  person for purposes of emailing that Content to that person.</p>
<p><strong>Software  Demo/Brochure Registration Information:</strong> Some of the Sites offer downloads of free demonstration  software and brochures for multiple software solutions. Once a User registers  to receive a demo or brochure, their registration information is shared with  vendors and/or resellers of those software solutions. This information is  forwarded to the vendor and/or reseller so that the User can receive additional  information on products or services from that vendor and/or reseller.  Additionally, this registration information may also be provided to vendors  and/or resellers of similar solutions.</p>
<p><strong>User  Generated Content:</strong> Some  Sites feature user generated content in the form of a user review section or  forum communities. In order to interact in these forums, a User must first  complete the applicable registration form and, in some case, terms of service  for the Site. The information provided by the User may be displayed in the  User's public profile in our forums and can be viewed by all visitors to this  Site. However, to ensure total privacy of our Users, we do not display any User  e-mail addresses.</p>
<p><strong>User  System Information:</strong> TechTarget’s  webcast application provides a system test that determines whether you can view  a webcast from your computer. This information is used to optimize the viewing  experience and to troubleshoot webcast viewing problems. We do not collect or  retain personally identifiable information in conducting these tests.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction Information:</strong> When you order paid  Content from the Sites or register to attend a paid in-person event on the  Sites, we ask you to complete an order form that requests certain information  from you, including a credit card number and expiration date and general  contact details. We do not retain the credit card information.</p>
<h2><a name="Disclosure" id="Disclosure"></a>Use and Disclosure of Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Member  Information:</strong> Certain TechTarget  Sponsors receive or are granted access to reports that may include your Member  Information. and, in some instances, information about your areas of interest  derived from your Clickstream Data. <strong>If you do not want this information shared, please see “How Can  You Opt Out of Use and Disclosure of Your Information?” below. </strong>TechTarget’s customer agreements  withSponsors: (a) provide that the Sponsor may use this information to  contact you via common methods of communication; and (b) prohibit disclosure of  the information to any third party other than agents of the Sponsor for the  permitted marketing purposes set forth above.

<p><strong>Clickstream  Data:</strong>TechTarget uses  Cookies to collect Clickstream Data on the Sites. TechTarget uses Cookies to  link User activity to their Member Information. Linking User activity  toMember Information allows our system to confirm a user's identity on  the Sites and to save and recognize Member log-in information so that Members  do not have to log in each time they visit the Sites or access Content. We use Clickstream  Data for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Help us recognize your  computer as a previous visitor, and save and remember any preferences that may  have been set while you were visiting one of our Web Sites or a Co-Branded  Site.</li>
  <li>Track, accumulate and  report information on our Sites and Content usage to our partners and customers  so that they can measure the effectiveness of advertisements and content viewed  on the Web Sites;</li>
  <li>Help us customize the  content and advertisements you are shown while visiting our Web Sites and  potentially other web sites online;</li>
  <li>Determine which  features Users like best to help us improve our Content and Sites, personalize  your user experience, and measure overall Site effectiveness; </li>
  <li>Share non-personally  identifying information about your areas of interest to third parties to allow  targeted advertising elsewhere on the internet using Tracking Technologies; and</li>
  <li>Disclose aggregated  information as detailed below.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Co-Branded  Websites:</strong> Member  Information collected when you register or log in on a Co-Branded Site, and  Clickstream Data collected when on the Co-Branded Site, are generally available  both to TechTarget and that partner. However, each partner's use of that Member  Information is governed by that partner's privacy policy and may be used for  follow up by telephone, email or other common methods. You should contact these  partners directly if you have any questions about their use of this  information.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure  of Aggregated Information:</strong> We  provide summary reports, based on our analysis of Clickstream Data, which may  include a description of your level of activity on our Sites, as well as  activity related to editorial and vendor content. An example of the type of  information included in a summary report is "3000 people looked at the xyz  white paper this week and, of those 3,000 people, 60% clicked through to read  the full white paper." This information is aggregated and does not  disclose any Member Information. TechTarget may also disclose aggregated user  statistics (for example, 25% of our users are interested in Networking)to  our customers, prospective customers and partners and other third parties, and  for other lawful purposes.</p>
<p><strong>TechTarget  Event Registration Information:</strong> When you register to attend a vendor-sponsored TechTarget  in person event (including Conferences, Custom Media events and Editorial  events), your contact information is used to confirm registrations and send  product information and promotional material from TechTarget and the event  sponsors (information may also be used to compile broad demographic  information). TechTarget may disclose your Event Registration Information to  those vendors sponsoring the event. Such vendor’s use of your Event  Registration Information is governed by that vendor’s privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction Information:</strong> We use this  information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e. to  deliver information, products or other services that you order and to invoice  you. We do not store your credit card information. If you order paid Content,  we may disclose your Member Information to the Content Sponsor. In addition, we  may disclose your name, address and transaction information to agents such as  couriers and fulfillment companies in order to effect the transaction and send  you the Content you have ordered, and we will provide your credit card details  only to the relevant bank or credit card company in order to complete the  transaction.</p>
