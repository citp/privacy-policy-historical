Nothing in this Privacy Policy should be interpreted to modify, delete or add terms to the Service Agreement.</p>
<p>
	KT has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and KT’s privacy practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html">TRUSTe's program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.

	Visitors to the Public Site are not required to reveal any personally identifiable information to KT. Visitors to the Public Site who wish to receive information regarding KT products or services may provide us with certain contact information including telephone number, fax number, email address, and mailing address.</p>
<p>	Through use of the Service, you may provide certain personal information for use and handling by KT solely for provision and maintenance of the Service.</p>

You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Public Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>

We may use your personal information to provide you with information about KT’s services, business partners, promotions, and events. Marketing emails from KT will contain instructions on how to opt out of receiving further marketing emails from KT. You will also have the right to opt out of any disclosure of your personal information to a third party or use of your personal information for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.</p>
<p>	We may use cookies and log information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Public Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions and contests.</p>
<p>	You acknowledge and agree that KT may use personally identifiable information input by you as necessary to provide the Service. This information may include e-mail address, business or home address, social media user names, employer/affiliated organization, telephone numbers, reasons for accessing site, and intended usage of requested information.

In no event does KT collect or use any personal information that you may include in any such documents. Also, you acknowledge and agree that you or your employer may enable various other users to access documents containing your personally identifiable information. KT is not responsible for how such parties may use your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>	<strong>Onward transfer of Information</strong><br>
	Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, KT will not disclose any personally identifiable information provided by a visitor to the Public Site to a third party unless the visitor has consented to such disclosure. In particular KT does not share, sell, rent, or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>
<p>	We may provide personally identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and contractors for the purpose of providing and maintaining the Service and for responding to your requests. We require that these parties agree to use such information solely for this purpose, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p>	We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state, federal and international laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</p>
<p>
	KT also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or other information about users that KT believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce its agreements, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our Service, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of KT, our users or others.</p>
