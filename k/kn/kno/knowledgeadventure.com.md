We do not require this information to use our products or gain access to our sites, however, you will not be able to utilize certain features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.

Visitors purchasing products or services through our on-line stores will be required to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.

Please note that, depending on the KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE site that you are visiting, many of the activities listed above may not be available and, as such, personal information may not be collected.

What other types of information may we collect?

For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other, non-personal information such as your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform preferences and combine such information with your personal information. In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding the capabilities of your computer to KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE. KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community and may provide such information to advertisers and/or our partners. In addition, KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may use such information for security or enforcement purposes.

How do we use your personal information?

The personal information you provide KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE will allow us to fulfill your product or service order, alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements, handle/route your customer service questions or issues, and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, contests, promotions, or special events and offers. KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE site with data from third parties. Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and serve our customers.

Please be advised that personal information submitted by individuals acting solely in a business capacity (e.g., personal information contained in job applicant's resume) is not subject to the uses set forth above or to any other practices stated in this Privacy Policy.

Who is collecting your information?

When you are asked for information while on the KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE site, you are sharing that information with KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE . In addition, some services are provided in conjunction with partner companies. If your personal information is being collected by another company other than KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE, you will be notified at the time the information is collected. If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at that time.

Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to our sites may collect personal information about you. Also, please remember, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, those other advertisers or websites.

With whom may your personal information be shared?

KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may need to disclose your personal information to third party vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process, analyze and/or store data. We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your personal information for any other purpose, and that they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against you if you are violating the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for a KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE site or product or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE's rights or property, other users of a KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE site or product, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.

As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE's successor or assign.

Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE.

KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE sites may also have message boards and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line and the user does so at his or her own risk.

What choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?

KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE attempts to allow you to control the way that we use personally identifiable information that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal information, KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In addition, many of the "mailings" KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings.

If at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties and/or receiving information from KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE (via e-mail or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You may contact us at Knowledge Adventure, Inc., 2377 Crenshaw Blvd., Suite 302, Torrance, CA 90501. You can also contact us by e-mailing us at opt-out@adventure.com . Please indicate what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we may better address your needs.

Information From Children Under 13

Once a child states that his/her age is under 13, we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information such as name, address, or email address.

Note to Parents: We believe protecting personal information about young children is important. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. Teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns.

What are cookies and how are they used?

Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allows Web sites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing or security purposes.

What are Internet protocol addresses?

An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, or to prevent our servers from being abused.

What to do if you want to correct or delete your personal information?

If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, at Knowledge Adventure, Inc., 2377 Crenshaw Blvd., Suite 302, Torrance, CA 90501\. You can also contact us by e-mailing us at privacy@adventure.com

How secure is your personal information?

While KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE takes reasonable steps to secure your personal information, no system is fault proof. If KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE's security systems are breached KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may attempt to notify you electronically and, by using the Service and/or providing personal information to us, you agree that we can notify you electronically. KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may post a notice on the KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE Web Site if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE Web Site. KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at privacy@adventure.com. If your email address changes and you have provided KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE with personal information, you should notify KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE at privacy@adventure.com so that we can communicate with you if necessary.

What if I have a question or complaint?

If you have any questions or wish to file a complaint, please feel free to e-mail us at privacy@adventure.com or send a letter addressed to Web Privacy Administrator, Knowledge Adventure, Inc., 2377 Crenshaw Blvd., Suite 302, Torrance, CA 90501.
