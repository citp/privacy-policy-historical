# Knowledge Hound Privacy Policy

Knowledge Hound is committed to respecting the privacy of our users. This policy details what information may be collected during a visit to our site and what we do with that information.

First, we never collect personally identifiable information from our users unless they contact us. Even then, any information that we receive is used solely to respond to a user's request. We do not sell any user information.

We collect non-personal information, such as your browser type and IP address. Knowledge Hound uses this information to help diagnose problems and to administer and improve our site. We may provide aggregate information (such as the number of visitors from a particular country) to third parties when this information is required during the course of business. We may share this non-personal information in the event that we merge with or are acquired by another company.

We use third-party advertising networks to serve ads when you visit us. These companies may use information gathered from your visits to Knowledge Hound and other websites in order to provide advertisements for goods and services of interest to you. This information does not include your name, address, email address, or telephone number. Knowledge Hound does not have access to this information.
