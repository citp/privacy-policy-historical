<h3>Knowledge Adventure, Inc. On-Line Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE, INC. is a global leader in multi-platform
interactive entertainment. KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE respects the privacy
of our on-line visitors and recognizes the importance of providing
a secure environment for them. We have adopted a corporate wide
On-Line Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store, and use
the information you provide us. This Privacy Policy details how
KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE safeguards the privacy of its on-line visitors
and does not apply to information that may be collected by
KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE off-line. Please note that when you link to
other sites from a KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE website, this Privacy Policy
does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those
other sites.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy will tell you:</p>

<ul>
<li>What websites and information are covered by this Privacy
Policy?</li>

<li>What personal identifying information may be collected?</li>

<li>What other types of information may be collected.</li>

<li>How your personal information may be used.</li>

<li>Who is collecting your information?</li>

<li>With whom your information may be shared.</li>

<li>What choices you have regarding the collection, use, and
distribution of your personal information.</li>

<li>Whether we collect information from children under the age of
13 and a specific note to parents.</li>

<li>What cookies are and how they may be used?</li>

<li>What are internet protocol addresses?</li>

<li>What to do if you want to correct, delete or review your
personal information.</li>

<li>How secure your personal information is.</li>

<li>What to do if you have a question or complaint.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding our
privacy policy statement or policies, please contact our Privacy
Policy Administrator at privacy@adventure.com.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ul>

<p>Please note that this privacy policy applies only to information
submitted and collected online through the websites listed above
and does not apply to information that may be collected by
Knowledge Adventure offline. In addition, this privacy policy
applies only to sites maintained by Knowledge Adventure and not to
websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we
link. Knowledge Adventure is therefore not responsible for the
content or activities provided on such sites.</p>

<p>European Union: Knowledge Adventure abides by the Safe Harbor
principles as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the
European Union.</p>

<p class="bold">What personal information is collected?</p>

<p>KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE only collects personal information on a
voluntary basis. If an on-line visitor submits information to
KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE, it will usually take the form of either: (1)
the purchase of goods or services though our on-line stores, (2)
product registration, e-Newsletter registration or registration for
on-line game and/or e-card participation, (3) message boards, (4)
warranty registrations, (5) sweepstakes and contest registrations,
(6) a consumer complaint, (7) surveys, and/or (8) newsletters.
Personal information collected may include your name, home address,
phone number, and/or e-mail address. We do not require this
information to use our products or gain access to our sites,
however, you will not be able to utilize certain features that
require registration or receive materials such as newsletters
unless such information is provided.</p>

<p>Visitors purchasing products or services through our on-line
stores will be required to provide additional information such as a
valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing
addresses.</p>

<p>Please note that, depending on the KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE site that
you are visiting, many of the activities listed above may not be
available and, as such, personal information may not be
collected.</p>

<br>
<p class="bold">What other types of information may we collect?</p>

<p>For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and
password and/or to provide other, non-personal information such as
your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform
preferences and combine such information with your personal
information. In addition, your web browser or client software may
transmit certain geographic information or information regarding
the capabilities of your computer to KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE. KNOWLEDGE
ADVENTURE may use this information to generate aggregate statistics
about our user community and may provide such information to
advertisers and/or our partners. In addition, KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE
may use such information for security or enforcement purposes.</p>

<p class="bold">How do we use your personal information?</p>

<p>The personal information you provide KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE will
allow us to fulfill your product or service order, alert you of new
products or services, features, or enhancements, handle/route your
customer service questions or issues, and/or notify you of upgrade
opportunities, contests, promotions, or special events and offers.
KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may enhance or merge the personal information
collected at a KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE site with data from third
parties. Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal
marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our
products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to
better understand and serve our customers.</p>

<p>Please be advised that personal information submitted by
individuals acting solely in a business capacity (e.g., personal
information contained in job applicant's resume) is not subject to
the uses set forth above or to any other practices stated in this
Privacy Policy.</p>

<p class="bold">Who is collecting your information?</p>

<p>When you are asked for information while on the KNOWLEDGE
ADVENTURE site, you are sharing that information with KNOWLEDGE
ADVENTURE . In addition, some services are provided in conjunction
with partner companies. If your personal information is being
collected by another company other than KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE, you
will be notified at the time the information is collected. If you
do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow
the transfer of information by not using that particular service or
by not providing any information at that time.</p>

<p>Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to our
sites may collect personal information about you. Also, please
remember, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control
the activities of, those other advertisers or websites.</p>

<p class="bold">With whom may your personal information be
shared?</p>

<p>KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may need to disclose your personal
information to third party vendors to fulfill product orders or
prizes, to process mailings, or to process, analyze and/or store
data. We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your
personal information for any other purpose, and that they have
agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of
the personal information they obtain from us. We reserve the right
to disclose your personal information as required by law or in
special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such
information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
against you if you are violating the Terms of Service or Use
Agreements for a KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE site or product or may be
causing injury to or interference (intentionally or
unintentionally) with KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE's rights or property,
other users of a KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE site or product, or anyone
else who could be harmed by your activities.</p>

<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset
of KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE and will become part of our normal business
records. As such, we may also disclose your personal information to
a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third
party, so you can continue to receive service and information in
connection with that line of business with as little disruption as
possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition,
reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal
information may be transferred to KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE's successor
or assign.</p>

<p>Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third
parties to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee
that they will adhere to the same privacy and security procedures
as KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE.</p>

<p>KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE sites may also have message boards and/or
chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one
another. When posting to a message board or chat area, please be
aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line
and the user does so at his or her own risk.</p>

<p class="bold">What choices do you have regarding the collection,
use, and distribution of your personal information?</p>

<p>KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE attempts to allow you to control the way
that we use personally identifiable information that we might
obtain. At the time you provide personal information, KNOWLEDGE
ADVENTURE may give you the option of declining any future offers or
information about new products, promotions, or services. In
addition, many of the "mailings" KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may send you,
such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the
receipt of any future mailings.</p>

<p>If at any time you wish to opt out of having your personal
information shared with third parties and/or receiving information
from KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE (via e-mail or postal mail) about new
products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You may contact
us at Knowledge Adventure, Inc., 2377 Crenshaw Blvd., Suite 302,
Torrance, CA 90501. You can also contact us by e-mailing us at
opt-out@adventure.com . Please indicate what publications or
services you no longer wish to receive so that we may better
address your needs.</p>

<p class="bold">Information From Children Under 13</p>

<p>Once a child states that his/her age is under 13, we do not
collect or store any personally identifiable information such as
name, address, or email address.</p>

<p>Note to Parents: We believe protecting personal information
about young children is important. We urge parents to instruct
their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or
phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. Teenagers under
the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents
to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke
our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns.</p>

<br>
<p class="bold">What are cookies and how are they used?</p>

<p>Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allows Web sites
to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping
purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to
"remember" things like your password, or that you have already
registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities,
saving the time you would normally spend entering information such
as your password or registration. In addition, KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE
may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional,
marketing or security purposes.</p>

<p class="bold">What are Internet protocol addresses?</p>

<p>An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number
assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP").
KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may track such IP addresses for system
administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, or
to prevent our servers from being abused.</p>

<p class="bold">What to do if you want to correct or delete your
personal information?</p>

<p>If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using
your personal information, or would like to correct or request that
we delete such personal information, please contact KNOWLEDGE
ADVENTURE, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, at Knowledge
Adventure, Inc., 2377 Crenshaw Blvd., Suite 302, Torrance, CA
90501. You can also contact us by e-mailing us at
privacy@adventure.com</p>

<p class="bold">How secure is your personal information?</p>

<p>While KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE takes reasonable steps to secure your
personal information, no system is fault proof. If KNOWLEDGE
ADVENTURE's security systems are breached KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may
attempt to notify you electronically and, by using the Service
and/or providing personal information to us, you agree that we can
notify you electronically. KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may post a notice on
the KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE Web Site if a security breach occurs. If
this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the
KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE Web Site. KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may also send an
email to you at the email address you have provided to us.
Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive
notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written
notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from
receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at
privacy@adventure.com. If your email address changes and you have
provided KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE with personal information, you should
notify KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE at privacy@adventure.com so that we can
communicate with you if necessary.</p>

<p class="bold">What if I have a question or complaint?</p>

<p>If you have any questions or wish to file a complaint, please
feel free to e-mail us at privacy@adventure.com or send a letter
addressed to Web Privacy Administrator, Knowledge Adventure, Inc.,
2377 Crenshaw Blvd., Suite 302, Torrance, CA 90501.</p>

<p>By using this Website, you signify your assent to this Privacy
Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not
use this site. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so
please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any
changes. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we
will notify you by posting the change on this website or in this
Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices
regarding such change. Your continued use of the Knowledge
Adventure website will signify your acceptance of these
changes.</p>
