Published on Jun 2, 2009

Dennis Media Transasia India values the privacy of those who use our web site, products and services and makes all commercially reasonable efforts to protect it. This Privacy Policy covers the collection, use and disclosure of personal information that may be collected any time you interact with us, such as when you visit our web site knowyourmobile.in, use or purchase our products and services, or communicate with us. Please read the following to learn more about what information we collect, what we do with that information, and how we may use your personal information.

**Information Collection and Use**  
The primary reason that we collect certain personal information is to provide the best possible level of customer service. It enables us to deliver product announcements, software updates and special offers as well as provide convenient and personalized user access and improve the features and usability of our products/information.   
We may collect information and use it for internal business purposes in a number of situations, for example:  
• Personal information such as name, e-mail address, contact preferences, which products and services you use, and transactional information such as your credit card number — to deliver and support our products and services;   
• Demographic information such as your occupation and where you use your computer and mobile devices — to improve our understanding of our customer needs;   
• Tracking information about your visit from the browser or application on your computer or mobile device, including IP address, cookies and the pages you request — to analyze trends, administer the site, track your navigation of the site, deliver relevant advertisements, information and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use (note that IP addresses are not linked to "personally identifiable information"); and   
• Aggregate information from multiple users without personally identifying individuals, such as geographic region, which we may share with our business partners — to improve understanding of customer needs and provide relevant services.   
You may elect to terminate your participation in the services at any time and/or delete information and material you have posted to any notebook. If you cancel your account, or delete any notebook or notebook content, it will no longer be accessible to you or others who may access the service, but there may continue to be residual copies of such information due to the nature of the computer system's operation and ongoing data back-up and archiving.

**Your Username and related information**  
The knowyourmobile.in web site allows you to create a "Username" based on your personal information. This is required in order to take full advantage of our services and any downloadable software products. It also allows us to provide more personalized and convenient service and saves time when you want to use our services, update your software or settings, or search for the requisite information.

**Public information**  
Certain portions of the knowyourmobile.in web sites and services are open to any online viewer, such as user notebooks designated as "public," and our user forum. Any information that you post in these locations can be read, collected and used by anyone, and could enable others to send you unsolicited messages. We enable you to determine whether or not to post personal or otherwise sensitive information to publically accessible areas of our site, and so you should carefully consider how you use the services. We are not responsible for any publication or use of any personal information you choose to post in these locations.
