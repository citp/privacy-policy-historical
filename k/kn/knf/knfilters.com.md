("K&N," "us," or "we") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared and respects the privacy of the visitors to the [http://www.knfilters.com](https://web.archive.org/default.aspx) website (this "Site"). We have created this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to demonstrate our commitment to privacy and security and supplement our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms_of_use.aspx) . This Privacy Policy is an agreement between K&N and you, as the user of this Site ("you"). It explains what information of yours will be collected by us when you use this Site, how the information will be used, how you can control the collection, when this Privacy Policy is effective, how we may change this Privacy Policy, and the steps we take to ensure that your personal information is protected. We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.

In this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means any information by which you can be identified or contacted, such as your name (first and last), mailing address, email address, telephone number, billing information, etc.

All activities which you engage in on this Site are voluntary. You are not required to provide any personal information to us unless you choose to access features or services on the Site which require the information. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy or other [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms_of_use.aspx) posted on this Site, then you should immediately exit this Site, discontinue using the Site, and do not provide us with any personal information. By your use of this Site, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy as well as to our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms_of_use.aspx).

We may combine all information we collect and may disclose this information within our corporate family of companies or our service providers.

 **Cookies Information:** When you visit the Site, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Site or services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

**Log File Information:** Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), operating system, location, date/time stamp, clickstream data, referring/exit pages and URLs, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

 **Clear Gifs Information:** When you use the Site or services, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personal information from your account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make this Site better for our users.

 **How We Use Your Information**

We use the personal information you provide and any general information we receive from you to (a) operate, maintain, and provide to you the best possible features, products, functionality of the Site and experience; (b) analyze visits to the Site and learn about the interests of our visitors in aggregate and also on a personal level to better understand your interests and needs, so we can assess product demand and improve our products and services and deliver to you the type of content, features, products and promotions that you are most interested in; (c) process registration requests when you register for our programs or services, or otherwise administer your participation in our programs or services; (d) respond to your comments, questions or complaints and determine your satisfaction with our programs, products and services; (e) administer a promotion, contest, sweepstakes, survey or other Site feature; and (f) send you marketing communications and other information and materials you have chosen to receive regarding our products, services, marketing or special events. We also use your personal information for our everyday business purposes such as security, processing online orders, payment processing, analytics, operations, fraud detection and prevention, reporting, making back-ups and legal compliance.

Any personal information or content you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Site (for instance, any content you post) (referred to herein as "User Content") becomes available to the public via the Site and our business partners. User Content includes, but is not limited to, testimonials, reviews, comments, photos, videos, etc. If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.

By providing K&N your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you Site and service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages including, but not limited to, newsletters, payment information, credit card update notifications, account status, legal updates, changes to features of the Site or services, product updates, special offers or promotions, or other account information. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by contacting us [privacy@knfilters.com](mailto:privacy@knfilters.com) or clicking on the opt out link contained in the email message. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. You may not opt out of service-related emails.

K&N may use certain information about you and/or your User Content without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Site is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions. 

K&N may develop special sites or administer promotions in cooperation with other companies. If you register at these "co-branded" sites or consent to receive email communications from our promotional partners, we may share your registration information (such as name and email address) with those companies.

K&N reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the Site. K&N has the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason including, without limitation, if in its sole opinion, such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms_of_use.aspx), or to protect or defend K&N’s rights or property or those of any third party. K&N also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.

We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Site and services; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (f) help you efficiently access information.

 **How We Share Your Information**

Personally Identifiable Information: K&N will not rent or sell your personal information to others. We may disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to those of our employees, contractors (including website operators), affiliated organizations, service providers, promotional partners and other third parties that provide support services to us or help us market our products and services, administer our programs and operations, fulfill your requests and orders, administer surveys, contests, and sweepstakes, or process any other information on our behalf to provide services available at our Site. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of K&N (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, K&N will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms_of_use.aspx) , take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our Site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of K&N, our users or others.

We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Site or services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful, as determined in our sole discretion. Release of your personal information for security purposes, as described in this agreement to any person or entity under any circumstances shall be based on a determination made solely by us, exercising our own discretion, permission for which is expressly granted by you to us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

 **Non-Personally Identifiable Information:** We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain services.

K&N allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements on the Site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.

K&N does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks K&N to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. 

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers. 

**How We Protect Your Information**

K&N uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to K&N or the Site and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, K&N makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. While we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.

**Compromise of Personal Information**

In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, K&N will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.

 **Children's Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, K&N does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on this Site. In the event we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please [privacy@knfilters.com](mailto:privacy@knfilters.com). 

**Social Media Interactions**

K&N invites you to socialize and share your experiences with K&N using Social Media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube, Google+ and Instagram. If you choose to use these tools, you may be sharing certain profile elements, including your comments. This sharing is subject to each social media program’s privacy policies. We also use Facebook Social Plugins to allow Facebook to share information and friends’ activities with its members while they are on our Site. For example, Social Plugins allow Facebook to show you your friends’ "Likes" on our product pages if you are logged into Facebook while using the services on our Site. K&N does not receive or control any of the content from Facebook Social Plugins. 

For more information about Facebook Social Plugins and other social media tools, [click here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/). 

We may allow you to sign in to your account using Facebook Connect. If you choose to do this, we may collect information necessary to facilitate social interactions such as friend lists, birthday, check-ins, basic profile information and your profile picture but only if the privacy settings you and your friends set within Facebook allow it. We will use the information we collect to create and facilitate an interactive social experience and to bring you products, services and programs from K&N. K&N will always comply with its Privacy Policy as well as with Facebook Connect terms regarding use of Facebook profile information.

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site nor the information or content contained therein. K&N may provide links to other websites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of linked sites does not imply endorsement by K&N of any of the linked sites. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Site to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our Site, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. We do not ensure the security of your personal information if you visit websites not belonging to K&N.

It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Site page, as determined by K&N in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.

If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes, modifications, additions, or deletions to this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately on their posting to this Site. You should check this Privacy Policy periodically as its terms may change from time to time. Your continued use of the Site after we post any such modifications will constitute your acknowledgment of the modified policy and your agreement to abide and be bound by the modified policy.

 **IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS**

 **Your California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we shared with third parties or corporate affiliates for those entities’ direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.

If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: **K &N Engineering, Inc. Attn.: Legal 1455 Citrus Street, Riverside, CA. 92507**. For all requests, you must put the statement "K&N California Privacy Rights Notice" in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. You also need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via telephone, email, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.

 **California Do Not Track Disclosures**

California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to "Do Not Track" (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. K&N does not currently take actions to respond to DNT signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once one is created. For information about DNT, please visit: [www.allaboutdnt.org](http://www.allaboutdnt.org/).
