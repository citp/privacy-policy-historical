Knack collects personally identifiable information when you register for a Knack account, information on forms requesting information, support, or product and service information, and when you subscribe to our newsletter. Knack may also use personally identifiable information about you which is publicly available. Knack only makes available your Account Information to its employees, agents and contractors who require such information in order to perform services for or on behalf of Knack, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.

You also have the option of supplying us with your occupation, and type of business or industry. Additionally, when you sign up for a Knack paid service, we collect your billing information, including your credit card number, expiration date, and billing address. From time to time, Knack may aggregate and de-identify this Account Information for Knack’s business and related purposes; however, Knack will never disclose your identifiable Account Information to third parties for commercial or other purposes not permitted by this Privacy Policy. 

Knack also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, browser type, referrer page, domain name, access time, entry page, exit page, operating system type, and search engine keywords used. Additionally, if you have chosen to receive email communications, you will receive our infrequent news and announcements. You may update or change your Account Information with Knack at any time by logging into your Account and updating such information. 

We mainly use the Account Information we collect to bill you for the Services, measure our business success, to identify the most effective ways to reach you, to more effectively meet your needs and requests for certain new product features and services, and to contact you about product upgrades. We may use your Account Information in order to provide you with support which you have requested in connection with your Account and the Services, or to identify services or products that we may provide at your request. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also use and disclose your Account Information (1) if required by court order, legal process or applicable law, (2) in connection with suspension, termination or expiration of the Terms of Service as set forth in the Terms of Service; and (3) as necessary to enforce or defend Knack intellectual property or other rights, as necessary in connection with legal action, or in exigent circumstances to protect the safety of Knack, Knack customers or the public. 

**Collection and Use of Customer Data Hosted by Knack**

This section of the Privacy Policy addresses how Knack may collect, process, store, use and disclose the data which you may create, maintain, use or disclose in connection with your Account (“Customer Data”). In order to provide the Services, Knack hosts and processes Customer Data in connection with your Account. By creating, maintaining, using or disclosing Customer Data in connection with the Service and your Account, you acknowledge that you are the owner or that you otherwise have the right, authority or consent to control such Customer Data and to authorize Knack and its employees, agents and contractors to take such actions with respect to Customer Data as described in this Privacy Policy. 

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, Customer Data in your Account is not accessible to anyone, unless you choose to make it accessible. Knack facilitates and provides tools for you to securely manage access to and use of your Customer Data, including sharing such information on a Knack website or making such information available to an End User. However, you, and only you, control whether and what Customer Data to create, maintain, use or disclose in connection with your Account and any corresponding Knack website. You are solely responsible for granting access to End Users, publishing, sharing, updating or deleting such Customer Data in your Account. Knack is not responsible for any such access to, activities, use or disclosure involving Customer Data, regardless of how or by whom such occurs. 

In limited circumstances, Knack or its employees, agents and contractors may have access to, use or disclose Customer Data in order to provide the Services. The following are some of the more common (but not exhaustive) circumstances under which Knack, and its employees, agents and contractors may have access to, use or disclose Customer Data in order to provide the Services: 

  1. To host, process, conduct data backups and maintenance, upgrades, debugging, troubleshooting, programming and other related administrative or technical activities required to provide the Services; 
  2. To conduct security activities related to preventing, detecting, investigating and responding to security incidents, threats or vulnerabilities, implementing security safeguards and controls and other activities related to security; 
  3. To respond to or provide support and related activities which you have requested in connection with your Account and the Services, or which you have otherwise consented to; 
  4. In response to court orders, legal process, or as otherwise required by applicable law. We will notify you and provide you with the opportunity to seek protection against disclosure in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Terms of Service; 
  5. In connection with suspension, termination or expiration of the Terms of Service as set forth in the Terms of Service, or as necessary to resolve any dispute related to the Terms of Service; or 
  6. When we act under exigent circumstances, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to protect the safety of customers or the public. 



Knack will only make available Customer Data to its employees, agents or contractors who have a need to know or access in order to provide services to or on behalf of Knack as described in the Privacy Policy. Knack will never use or disclose Customer Data for marketing, advertising or other similar commercial purposes. 

**Collection and Use of Customer Data Subject to Regional Data Protection Laws**

In certain circumstances, customers may have Customer Data which is subject to additional local, national, regional or international data protection laws (“Data Protection Laws”), including but not limited to (i) the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and its related regulations, as amended from time to time (“HIPAA”), which governs “covered entities” and their “business associates” as each term is described by HIPAA; and (ii) the GDPA, which governs “data controllers”, “data processors” , and the processing of “personal data”, as each term is described by the GDPR. Because Knack cannot independently determine whether and to what extent a customer or Customer Data is subject to such Data Protection Laws, you **_must_** (1) notify and obtain Knack’s consent to use the Services in connection with any such Customer Data, and (2) enter into a written HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (“HIPAA BAA”), Regional Data Processing Addendum or other written addendum with Knack, as applicable. You must complete both actions prior to creating, maintaining, using or disclosing any such data in connection with your Account. Failure to comply with this section and the Terms of Service may result in suspension or termination of your Account in Knack’s sole discretion. 

Knack and its employees, agents and subcontractors may only access, maintain, use and disclose such as permitted by the terms and conditions of the applicable written addendum. This includes, but is not limited to, access, use or disclosure in order to provide the Services and as described in this Privacy Policy. If a use or disclosure of Customer Data described in this Privacy Policy would be prohibited by such addendum, including but not limited to a HIPAA BAA or Regional Data Processing Addendum, such addendum will control with respect to such use or disclosure. 

You may have the ability to exercise certain rights with respect to personal data under Data Protection Laws, including where you are located within the European Union.
