<p><em>For Website Users and Clients</em><br>
<em>Last modified September 1st, 2012.</em></p>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>

<p>knackhq.com (together with its affiliates, "Knack") is committed to respecting your privacy and the privacy of the information in your account.  That is why we have established this Privacy Statement.  Our intention is to treat your information with utmost care and consideration. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact Knack as outlined below.</p>

<p>We want you to know that we are not in the business of selling or renting individuals' personal data to other companies for any purpose.</p>

<p>This Privacy Statement contains Knack's handling of personally identifiable information that is gathered when you are on Knack's site, and when you use Knack's services.  This Privacy Statement applies exclusively to the site www.knackhq.com (the "Site").  This policy does not cover or apply to the practices of organizations that use our services on their websites, that Knack does not own or control, information collected offline, or to non- Knack employees.</p>

<p><strong>COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>Knack collects personally identifiable information when you register for an Knack account, when you fill out any form requesting information, support, or product and service information, and when you subscribe to our news.  Knack may also receive personally identifiable information from its business partners.</p>

<p>Knack may collect the following personally identifiable information: your name, title, phone number, email address, mailing address, website URL, employer or company.  You also have the option of supplying us with your occupation, and type of business or industry.  Additionally, when you sign up for an Knack paid service, we collect your billing information, including your credit card number, expiration date, and billing address.</p>

<p>Knack also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, browser type, referrer page, domain name, access time, entry page, exit page, operating system type, and search engine keywords used.</p>

<p>We mainly use the information we collect to measure our business success, to identify the most effective ways to reach you, the customer, to more effectively meet your needs and requests for certain new product features and services, and to contact you about product upgrades. Additionally, if you have chosen to receive email communications, you will receive our infrequent news and announcements.</p>

<p><strong>DATA HOSTED BY KNACK </strong></p>

<p>Knack hosts the data stored in your Knack account.  That data is strictly your property and is governed by the Knack's Terms of Service Agreement.  The data in your account is not accessible to anyone, unless you make it accessible.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</strong></p>

<p>Certain Knack employees have various access levels to Knack systems, including databases, for the purposes of support, backups, maintenance, debugging, and other administrative and programming activities.  However, Knack will not monitor, edit, disclose, sell, or rent neither the data stored in your Knack account, nor your personally identifiable information, to anyone other than what is disclosed below.  It is only under the following circumstances that we may send your information to other companies or people: <br>
1.    When we have your consent to share the information.<br>
2.    In the event the information disrupts the performance of Knack's servers or causes server-wide outages.<br>
3.    When we need to share your information to provide you with a service or product you are requesting.<br>
4.    When we need to send the information to companies that work on our behalf to process an order you have made, or so they can provide a product or service to you.  Note that these companies are not allowed to use your information for any reason other than to support us in assisting you.  We employ the services of third-party payment processors to complete the payment fulfillment process for purchases made on the Site.<br>
5.    When we conform to edicts of the law, to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes.<br>
6.    When you have violated our Terms of Service Agreement for the service you are using or have used.<br>
7.    When we act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our customers or the public.<br>
8.    When we need to protect and defend the rights or property of Knack.<br>
9.    From time to time we may share aggregate data about our customers with other companies.  In such cases no personally identifiable data will be made available to third parties.<br>
10.    By using our website and our services and providing us with your personal data, you consent to this transfer of your personal data.</p>
