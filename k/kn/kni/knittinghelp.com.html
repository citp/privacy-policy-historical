Outer Limits Media, Inc. d.b.a KnittingHelp.com. ("KnittingHelp.com," "we," "us") shares your concerns regarding the protection of your personal information online. This Privacy &amp; Security Policy ("Policy") describes our practices regarding the collection and use of information through our website, located at www.knittinghelp.com any of our sub sites and any web pages (collectively, the "Site"). By using the Site or obtaining any product or service through this Site, you agree to the collection and use of information as set forth in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Site.<br>
<br>
We may from time to time update this Policy. You can determine when this Policy was last updated by checking the "Effective Date of Current Policy"&nbsp; found at the bottom of the Policy.

<h3>What Information We Collect</h3>KnittingHelp.com collects the following types of information during your visits to our Site. <br>
<br>
First, we collect non-personally identifiable information. When visitors come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which links were "clicked." Collecting such information involves logging the IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the Site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, it may be possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of the visitor's point of connectivity. <br>
<br>
We use "cookies" to collect non-personally identifiable information regarding you. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. Cookies make it possible for us to recognize your browser when you visit our Site. By doing this, we can personalize your return visits and save you time during login and checkout. Your browser must be set to accept cookies in order for you to enjoy the benefits of being a registered user of the Site. <br>
<br>
We collect personal and personally identifiable information such as your name and email address when you sign up to be member of our forum. Additionally, if you purchase products through our store we request additional personal information such as your address and billing information in order to process your order.<br>
<br>

This information aids us in advertising and in developing the Site.<br>
<br>
We also may share aggregated statistical data and other non-personally identifiable information with our current and potential business partners, and with our service providers. Such information includes the total number of visitors in a particular month or the top keyword searches that landed people on the Site.

<h3>Service Providers</h3>We work with third parties (Merchant America, PayPal, etc.) who provide services, including but not limited to order processing and fulfillment, credit card clearance and other services of an administrative nature.
