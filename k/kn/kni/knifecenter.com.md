# Security at the KnifeCenter of the Internet - Knife Center

Last Updated: 7/11/2019

#### 1\. Your Security

As we all know, the internet can be a dangerous place for everyone's personal information. Having been online since 1995, the KnifeCenter has always taken the protection of customers' security and privacy as our primary responsibility. We wouldn't want to lose our own personal information and we respect our visitors and customers, so we do everything in our power to protect their Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and payment information (PCI) . We take appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, considering the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the PII and/or PCI. Our websites and servers use systems and software designed to safely store and transmit all information. Our office is protected by a firewall from the outside to ensure that all information within our network and on the premises is secure.

#### 2\. Privacy Statement

We gather certain types of information about the visitors to our websites and those visitors who use its services, and we believe our visitors should fully understand how we obtain and use that information. This Privacy Statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. Any comments or questions about this Privacy Statement or our privacy policies should be directed to us through our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/info/contact-us/) form.

#### 3\. Your Personally Identifiable Information

The submission by you to Knifecenter.com of personally identifiable information (e.g., your name, address, email address, telephone number, age, username, profile information, etc.) may be required in order for you to receive certain services, products or information you request from Knifecenter.com — and some personally identifiable information is required in order to sign up for a KnifeCenter account. The information that you share with us is to be used for our business purposes, in conjunction with our service providers, and as provided in this privacy policy. If we do not have your express consent, our policy is to restrict the use of your personally identifiable information. In addition, U.S. law enforcement agencies may require us, through legal action, to disclose your personal information.

In certain locations on our websites in which we obtain personally identifiable information from you, we may include “check boxes” for the purpose of soliciting your consent to receive special offers and other information from Knifecenter.com. If given your consent, you may receive promotional information from us by email, U.S. mail or other means. By confirming, you are choosing to receive commercial email communications from Knifecenter.com. In that event, you will have the opportunity at any time to “opt-out” of receiving future commercial emails from Knifecenter.com either by following the instructions located at the bottom of the email we send you or in your Knifecenter [Account Preferences](https://web.archive.org/members/index.html?page=login) Page.
