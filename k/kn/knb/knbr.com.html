                    Privacy Policy</b></p>
                  <p align="left">Protecting your personal privacy is very important 
                    to us. We hope the following statement will help you understand 
                    how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information 
                    you provide to us. Specifics about what information is collected 
                    and how it is used follows this Privacy Policy Statement. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Your personal privacy is a principal concern to us. Our goal 
                    in outlining our policy on the collection and use of listener/customer 
                    data is to ensure the highest level of confidentiality and 
                    security. When you provide your personal information to us, 
                    we will not give or sell your personal information to any 
                    outside company for its use in marketing or solicitation. 
                    We will maintain the confidentiality of your personal information 
                    and it will be used only to support your customer relationship 
                    with our radio stations, assisting us in providing better 
                    and more targeted services to you. Additionally, internal 
                    practices are in place to help protect your privacy by limiting 
                    employee access to and use of customer data. When we ask for 
                    customer/listener information, it is done with the goal of 
                    improving the relationship between KNBR and the listener. 
                    At KNBR, we allow our listeners to maintain control over their 
                    personal data while attempting to provide a more interactive 
                    online experience. Our intention is to send e-mail only to 
                    listeners/customers who have chosen to receive such e-mails. 
                    At any time, you have the right to decline receiving future 
                    communications in any manner, including email, fax, telephone 
                    and postal mail. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Privacy Policies </b> <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Information Collection </b><br>
                    When you browse KNBR's Web site, you do so anonymously. Personal 
                    information -- including your e-mail address -- is not collected. 
                    Some of our Web sites, however, may request that you voluntarily 
                    supply us with personal information, including your E-mail 
                    address for purposes such as correspondence, site registration, 
                    membership, making a purchase, contests or participating in 
                    online surveys. We may ask for your name, e-mail address, 
                    telephone number, mailing address and birthdate. Other optional 
                    information may be asked (listener/customer preference information, 
                    social security numbers, lifestyle interests, and other demographic 
                    information) that is needed to register or subscribe you to 
                    services or offers. <br>
                    <br>
                    Like many other commercial Web sites, KNBR may use a standard 
                    technology called a "cookie" to collect information about 
                    how our site is used. Please read about Cookies at the end 
                    of this statement for more information. <br>
                    <br>
                    We collect only information that is needed, and we tell listeners/customers 
                    how we use it. We limit the collection of information about 
                    our listeners/customers to what we need to know to manage 
                    their membership, to provide customer service, to offer new 
                    products and services, and to fulfill any legal and regulatory 
                    requirements. We tell our listeners/customers about the general 
                    uses of information we collect about them, and we will provide 
                    additional explanation if requested. We give listeners/customers 
                    choices about how their data will be used. On a regular basis, 
                    we provide our listeners/customers the ability to decline 
                    any or all future email communications. Listeners/customers 
                    may also decide if and how they wish to be contacted via other 
                    communication media. We give listeners/customers access to 
                    their data online. A listener/customer may change, update 
                    or add additional information about themselves at any time 
                    through our web site, which offers this feature.<br>
                    <br>
                    We ensure information quality. We use advanced technology 
                    and well-defined employee practices to help ensure that listener/customer 
                    data is processed promptly, accurately and completely. <br>
                    <br>
                    We use information security safeguards. Access to listener/customer 
                    data is limited to those who specifically need it to conduct 
                    their business responsibilities. We use security techniques 
                    designed to protect our listener/customer data -- especially 
                    that data which is used by employees and business partners 
                    to fulfill listener/customer services. We limit the release 
                    of listener/customer information. In addition to providing 
                    listeners/customers with the opportunity to refuse marketing 
                    offers, we release information only at the listeners'/customers' 
                    requests, or when required to do so by law or other regulatory 
                    authority. When a court order or subpoena requires us to release 
                    information, we notify the listener/customer directly so that 
                    his/her legal rights can be exercised, if appropriate. The 
                    only exceptions to this policy are when we are prohibited 
                    by court order or law from notifying the listener/customer, 
                    or cases in which fraud and/or criminal activity is suspected. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We hold employees responsible for our privacy principles. 
                    Each employee is personally responsible for maintaining listener 
                    and customer confidentiality. All employees are required to 
                    sign an agreement that they will comply with these policies. 
                    Employees who violate these policies are subject to disciplinary 
                    action, up to and including dismissal. Employees are expected 
                    to report violations -- and may do so confidentially -- to 
                    their managers or other supervisors. Each station has an employee 
                    who has been assigned the responsibility for assuring the 
                    adherence to our privacy policy.</p>
                  <p align="left"><b>Information Use </b><br>
                    If you provide us with your E-mail address, or have done so 
                    in the past, we may send you E-mail offers or newsletters. 
                    These offers or newsletters are based on information you provided 
                    in your membership application, registration forms, in surveys, 
                    from information that may indicate purchasing preferences 
                    and lifestyle, as well as information available from external 
                    sources, such as census bureau data. These E-mail offers will 
                    come from KNBR only. Your information or email address is 
                    never sold to a third party. All offers are carefully developed 
                    to guarantee that they meet our standards. Our goal is to 
                    target offers to listeners/customers who will find them of 
                    value. <br>
                    <br>
                    The data you provide is used to enhance the services and offers 
                    our radio stations bring you. As a result of providing personal 
                    information, KNBR can provide a more customized online experience, 
                    making your interaction with us more productive, helpful and 
                    fun. You can also expect to receive occasional communications 
                    targeted directly toward your lifestyle interests. <br>
                    <br>
                    KNBR provides listeners/customers with an easy means to decline 
                    receiving E-mail offers and recognizes the importance of providing 
                    you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue 
                    receiving these offers from us by simply replying to the E-mail 
                    address included in every e-mail message you receive from 
                    KNBR. <br>

                    <b>Activity Tracking </b><br>
                    We do monitor URL click-throughs found in our email messages. 
                    The click-through rate is reviewed in order to: track participation 
                    in contests in order to judge effectiveness and to award prizes;

                    Third party Internet sites and services accessible through

                    A Word About Cookies</b></p>
                  <p align="left">Cookies 
                    were originally designed to help a Web site distinguish a 
                    user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember 
                    any preferences that may have been set while the user was 
                    browsing the site. A cookie is a small string of text that 
                    a Web site can send to your browser. A cookie cannot retrieve 
                    any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, 
                    or capture your E-mail address. Currently, Web sites use cookies 
                    to enhance the user's visit; in general, cookies can securely 
                    store a user's ID and password, personalize home pages, identify 
                    which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections 
                    in a "shopping cart." <br>
                    <br>
                    If you are just browsing KNBR.com, a cookie identifies only 
                    your browser. If you sign up for a free email account, a cookie 
                    is issued for security purposes. The cookie is set when you 
                    login and times out 30 minutes after your last interaction 
                    with your email account. After you are logged out (manually 
                    or by the cookie) the cookie is rendered invalid and goes 
                    away when your cache is cleared. This type of security measure 
                    is useful for individuals who share a machine or use a public 
                    machine. </p>

                    (with a designated user ID and password), we may use cookies 
                    so that we can provide personalized information that we believe 
                    will be of value to you based on preferences you have stated 
                    while visiting the site. It is possible to set your browser 
                    to inform you when a cookie is being placed -- this way, you 
                    have the opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. 
                    If you are just browsing one of our sites and are not a registered 
                    user, you do not have to accept a cookie and you may still
