# KNBR's Privacy Policy

**KNBR's Privacy Policy**

Protecting your personal privacy is very important to us. We hope the following statement will help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us. Specifics about what information is collected and how it is used follows this Privacy Policy Statement. 

Your personal privacy is a principal concern to us. Our goal in outlining our policy on the collection and use of listener/customer data is to ensure the highest level of confidentiality and security. When you provide your personal information to us, we will not give or sell your personal information to any outside company for its use in marketing or solicitation. We will maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and it will be used only to support your customer relationship with our radio stations, assisting us in providing better and more targeted services to you. Additionally, internal practices are in place to help protect your privacy by limiting employee access to and use of customer data. When we ask for customer/listener information, it is done with the goal of improving the relationship between KNBR and the listener. At KNBR, we allow our listeners to maintain control over their personal data while attempting to provide a more interactive online experience. Our intention is to send e-mail only to listeners/customers who have chosen to receive such e-mails. At any time, you have the right to decline receiving future communications in any manner, including email, fax, telephone and postal mail. 

**Privacy Policies**

**Information Collection**  
When you browse KNBR's Web site, you do so anonymously. Personal information -- including your e-mail address -- is not collected. Some of our Web sites, however, may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your E-mail address for purposes such as correspondence, site registration, membership, making a purchase, contests or participating in online surveys. We may ask for your name, e-mail address, telephone number, mailing address and birthdate. Other optional information may be asked (listener/customer preference information, social security numbers, lifestyle interests, and other demographic information) that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. 

Like many other commercial Web sites, KNBR may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. Please read about Cookies at the end of this statement for more information. 

We collect only information that is needed, and we tell listeners/customers how we use it. We limit the collection of information about our listeners/customers to what we need to know to manage their membership, to provide customer service, to offer new products and services, and to fulfill any legal and regulatory requirements. We tell our listeners/customers about the general uses of information we collect about them, and we will provide additional explanation if requested. We give listeners/customers choices about how their data will be used. On a regular basis, we provide our listeners/customers the ability to decline any or all future email communications. Listeners/customers may also decide if and how they wish to be contacted via other communication media. We give listeners/customers access to their data online. A listener/customer may change, update or add additional information about themselves at any time through our web site, which offers this feature.

We ensure information quality. We use advanced technology and well-defined employee practices to help ensure that listener/customer data is processed promptly, accurately and completely. 

We use information security safeguards. Access to listener/customer data is limited to those who specifically need it to conduct their business responsibilities. We use security techniques designed to protect our listener/customer data -- especially that data which is used by employees and business partners to fulfill listener/customer services. We limit the release of listener/customer information. In addition to providing listeners/customers with the opportunity to refuse marketing offers, we release information only at the listeners'/customers' requests, or when required to do so by law or other regulatory authority. When a court order or subpoena requires us to release information, we notify the listener/customer directly so that his/her legal rights can be exercised, if appropriate. The only exceptions to this policy are when we are prohibited by court order or law from notifying the listener/customer, or cases in which fraud and/or criminal activity is suspected. 

We hold employees responsible for our privacy principles. Each employee is personally responsible for maintaining listener and customer confidentiality. All employees are required to sign an agreement that they will comply with these policies. Employees who violate these policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. Employees are expected to report violations -- and may do so confidentially -- to their managers or other supervisors. Each station has an employee who has been assigned the responsibility for assuring the adherence to our privacy policy.

**Information Use**  
If you provide us with your E-mail address, or have done so in the past, we may send you E-mail offers or newsletters. These offers or newsletters are based on information you provided in your membership application, registration forms, in surveys, from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from external sources, such as census bureau data. These E-mail offers will come from KNBR only. Your information or email address is never sold to a third party. All offers are carefully developed to guarantee that they meet our standards. Our goal is to target offers to listeners/customers who will find them of value. 

The data you provide is used to enhance the services and offers our radio stations bring you. As a result of providing personal information, KNBR can provide a more customized online experience, making your interaction with us more productive, helpful and fun. You can also expect to receive occasional communications targeted directly toward your lifestyle interests. 

KNBR provides listeners/customers with an easy means to decline receiving E-mail offers and recognizes the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply replying to the E-mail address included in every e-mail message you receive from KNBR. 

**Activity Tracking**  
We do monitor URL click-throughs found in our email messages. The click-through rate is reviewed in order to: track participation in contests in order to judge effectiveness and to award prizes; track listener interests; track response rates for station marketing purposes or to report to a client in aggregate form only, the response of listeners. Individual activity is never shared with employees or third parties. 

**Children**  
KNBR does not knowingly solicit data from children, and we will not knowingly market to children. We define children as anyone under 12 years of age. 

**What else should I know about my privacy?**  
Third party Internet sites and services accessible through KNBR have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. KNBR has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords, membership ID, or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. While we aim to protect your personal information, KNBR cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

While KNBR puts forth its best efforts in adhering to these minimum privacy standards, additional restrictions may be imposed to comply with state and local laws, and/or station specific programs, products and services.

A Word About Cookies**

Cookies were originally designed to help a Web site distinguish a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie is a small string of text that a Web site can send to your browser. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your E-mail address. Currently, Web sites use cookies to enhance the user's visit; in general, cookies can securely store a user's ID and password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections in a "shopping cart." 

If you are just browsing KNBR.com, a cookie identifies only your browser. If you sign up for a free email account, a cookie is issued for security purposes. The cookie is set when you login and times out 30 minutes after your last interaction with your email account. After you are logged out (manually or by the cookie) the cookie is rendered invalid and goes away when your cache is cleared. This type of security measure is useful for individuals who share a machine or use a public machine. 

If you become a registered user on KNBR.com (with a designated user ID and password), we may use cookies so that we can provide personalized information that we believe will be of value to you based on preferences you have stated while visiting the site. It is possible to set your browser to inform you when a cookie is being placed -- this way, you have the opportunity to decide whether to accept the cookie. If you are just browsing one of our sites and are not a registered user, you do not have to accept a cookie and you may still continue utilizing the site, though you might not be able to experience the site to fullest extent. 

Here is how to set your cookie preferences: 

Netscape Navigator 3: Select Network Preferences from the Options menu. From the Network Preferences menu, select the Protocols tab and modify your preference if you wish to be warned before accepting cookies. 

Netscape Navigator 4: Select Preferences from the Edit menu. From the Preferences menu, select Advanced, and several options for cookies will be listed in the lower right of the menu. Additionally, you may select Help for more details. For further information about the Netscape browser and use of cookies, visit Netscape's Web site. 

Microsoft Internet Explorer 3: Select Options from the View menu. Choose the Advanced menu to modify your preference if you wish to be warned before accepting cookies. 

Microsoft Internet Explorer 4: Select Options from the View menu. Choose the Advanced menu and scroll to the section labeled "Cookies," where several options are listed. For further information about the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser and use of cookies, visit Microsoft's Web site. 

AOL: If you are using AOL v3.0 for Windows 95: Select Preferences from the Members menu. Click on the WWW icon and select Advanced. Modify your preference if you wish to be warned before accepting cookies. If you are using the following AOL browsers, you will not be able to set cookie preferences since these browsers automatically accept cookies: AOL v3.0 for Windows 3.0, using AOL's proprietary browser or AOL's version of Microsoft Internet Explorer v3.0; AOL for the MAC, using AOL's version of Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.1. All other earlier versions of AOL browsers do not support cookies, and therefore cannot authenticate you as a registered user on Web sites that involve sending or receiving personal account information. **
