</h3>
<h4>
  We collect the following types of information from our users:
</h4>
<p>
  <b>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</b><br>
  We may receive and store any information you submit to the Application (or otherwise authorize us to obtain – such as, from (for example) your Facebook account). The types of personal information collected may include your full name, username, e-mail address, Facebook Id, Facebook profile photos, Facebook friends’ id and Facebook friends’ full name; these are currently the information necessary for us to provide the Application services.

</p>
<p>
  <b>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</b><br>
  We receive and store certain types of usage related information whenever you interact with Application. For example, Khmer.be may automatically receive and record information regarding your computer’s IP address, browser information, Facebook user ID, Facebook Page fan status, and URLs accessed. Such information may be shared in aggregate (non-personally identifiable) form with our partners.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Analytics Information:</b>
  We use third-party analytic tools to help us collect traffics to our Application. The tool might collect information sent by your web browsers and mobile device, including, not limit to, the web pages you visit, and other information that might help us analyze and improve the Application.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Mobile Device Identifiers:</b>
  </p><ul>
  <li> When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device.

  <li>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</li>
