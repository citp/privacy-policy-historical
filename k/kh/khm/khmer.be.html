          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px ! important;">About Khmer.be
          and the Information We Collect</h3>
          <h1>Profile Information submitted by Members to Khmer.be</h1>
          <p>Khmer.be is an online social networking community that connects
          people through networks of friends for communicating, sharing and
          making new friends. To accomplish this, each Khmer.be Member creates
          his or her own profile, which contains the personal information that
          the Member chooses to include. This personal information includes such
          things as:</p>
          <li>First name or first and last names of the Member (depending on the
            options selected by the Member), Gender, age, martial status and other, similar personal
            information, Occupation, Location (e.g., city and state), and Photos, videos or other shared content uploaded by the Member to
            his or her profile, to the extent that it includes personal
            information.</li>
          <h1 class="smalltopbottommargin">Other Information submitted by
          Members to Khmer.be</h1>
          <p>Khmer.be also collects Member-submitted account information such as
          name and email address, to identify Members and send notifications
          related to the use of the Khmer.be service.</p>
          <p>You should also be aware that Members may reveal other personal
          information while communicating on other areas of the Khmer.be
          website, such as while participating in discussions on Khmer.be
          Groups and/or posting information on Khmer.be Forums. This information, in turn, might be viewed by other Members
          or visitors to the Khmer.be website who are not Members.</p>
          <h1 class="smalltopbottommargin">Information Not Directly Submitted by
          Members or Other Website Users to Khmer.be</h1>
          <p>Finally, we also collect some information from Members, as well as
          from other visitors to the Khmer.be website, that is not personally
          identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This information is
          gathered from all Members and visitors to the website.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px ! important;">Use of
          Information Obtained by Khmer.be</h3>
          <h1 class="smalltopbottommargin">Profile Information submitted by
          Members to Khmer.be</h1>
          <p>The personal information of a Member contained in his or her
          profile will be shown to those people whom the Member chooses. Each
          Member has three options when choosing the level of sharing of his or
          her profile. They are:</p>
          <li>"Friends" which consists only of that Member's friends,</li>
          <li>"Friends of Friends" which consists of that Member's
            friends, as well as the extended group of people who are friends of
            that Member's friends, and</li>
          <li>"Anyone" which is all visitors to the Khmer.be website,
            whether or not they are Khmer.be members.</li>
          <p><b>PLEASE NOTE THAT, REGARDLESS OF WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION A
          MEMBER CHOOSES TO INCLUDE IN HIS OR HER PROFILE, OR WHAT LEVEL OF
          SHARING HE OR SHE CHOOSES, CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT EACH MEMBER WILL
          BE INCLUDED IN THAT MEMBER'S "PUBLIC PROFILE," WHICH IS AN
          ABBREVIATED VERSION OF A Khmer.be PROFILE. A LIST OF THE INFORMATION
          CONTAINED IN EACH PUBLIC PROFILE CAN BE FOUND IN THE Khmer.be <a href="http://khmer.be/data/html/terms.htm">TERMS
          OF SERVICE</a>.</b></p>
          <h1 class="smalltopbottommargin">Other Information submitted by
          Members to Khmer.be</h1>
          <p>Except where a Member might choose to include a full name in his or
          her profile, a Member's email address and full name will only be used
          in the following circumstances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>When the Member invites a friend via email to become a Khmer.be
              Member,</li>
            <li>When the Member sends a request to another Member to add the
              other Member to his or her friend list,</li>
            <li>When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her
              use of the Khmer.be service or Khmer.be website, and</li>
            <li>If the Member so chooses, when we send regular notifications,
              weekly updates, or other news regarding the Khmer.be service or
              the Khmer.be website.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Except when inviting or adding friends, a Member's email address
          will never be shared with or displayed to any other person. Members
          and their friends, and other Members within their personal networks
          (depending on the level of sharing a Member has chosen) communicate on
          Khmer.be with each other through the Khmer.be service, without
          disclosing email addresses.</p>
          <h1 class="smalltopbottommargin">Information that Members do not
          submit to us</h1>
          <p>We use information relating to the server information, IP address.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px ! important;">Sharing
          of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</h3>
          <p>Except as explained above, or where you are expressly informed
          otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your
          personal information, unless required by law or for the protection of
          your Membership. However, Khmer.be may share profile information and
          aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner
          with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to
          Members and other users of the Khmer.be website more targeted
          advertising, products and services. In such situations we will never
          disclose information that would personally identify you.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px ! important;">Links</h3>
          <p>The Khmer.be Website contains links to other websites. This
          includes links that are placed there by Khmer.be (such as in
          advertisements), as well as by other Khmer.be Members. Please be aware
          that Khmer.be is not responsible for the privacy practices of any
          other website. We encourage all Members and other users of the Khmer.be
          website to be aware of when they leave our website, and to read the
          privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally
          identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to
          information collected by Khmer.be through the Khmer.be website.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px ! important;">Use of
          Cookies</h3>
          <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer
          for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Khmer.be website.
          However, we do not and will not use cookies to collect private
          information from any Member or other user of the Khmer.be website
          which they did not intentionally submit to us, other than as stated in
          this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>We use both "session ID cookies" and "persistent
          cookies." We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to
          navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you
          browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an
          extended period of time. Note also that Members may optionally use a
          cookie to remember their email in order to automatically log in to our
          website. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions
          provided in your Internet browsers's "help" file; however,
          please note that, if you reject cookies or disable cookies in your web
          browser, you may not be able to use the Khmer.be website.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px ! important;">Correcting/Updating
          or Removing Information</h3>
          <p><b>REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO MAY VIEW
          YOUR PROFILE AT ANY TIME. YOU CAN CHANGE THESE PROFILE SHARING
          SETTINGS BY CLICKING THE "USER SETTINGS" LINK ON THE BOTTOM,
          LEFT CORNER OF THE Khmer.be HOMEPAGE. ALSO, YOU CAN ALWAYS CHANGE THE
          PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU'VE SUBMITTED TO THE Khmer.be WEBSITE,
          INCLUDING THE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN YOUR Khmer.be PROFILE, BY
          CLICKING THE "EDIT PROFILE" LINK ON YOUR Khmer.be PROFILE
          PAGE.</b></p>
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px ! important;">Changes
          in Our Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our
          web site so Members and other users of the Khmer.be website are always
          aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
          circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use Members'
          or other users' personally identifiable information in a manner
          different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify
          those Members and users via email or by placing a prominent notice on
          our website.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px ! important;">Invite a
          Friend</h3>
          <p>If a Member elects to use our "Invite" feature to invite
          a friend to become a Member of the Khmer.be service, we ask them for
          the friend's email address. Khmer.be will automatically send the
          friend an email inviting them to join the site. Khmer.be stores this
          email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent
          to the friends list of the Member sending the invitation, and also to
          send reminders of the invitation. Khmer.be will never sell these email
          addresses or use them to send any other communication besides
          invitations and invitation reminders. Any person who receives an
          invitation may <a class="biglink" href="http://khmer.be/contact.aspx">contact
          Khmer.be</a> to request the removal of this information from our
          database.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px ! important;">Security</h3>
          <p>The Khmer.be account of every Member is password-protected. Khmer.be
          takes every precaution to protect the information of the Members, as
          well as information collected from other users of the Khmer.be
          website. We use industry standard measures to protect all information
          that is stored on our servers and within our database. We limit the
          access to this information to those employees who need access to
          perform their job function such as our customer service personnel. If
          you have any questions about the security at our website, please <a class="biglink" href="http://khmer.be/contact.aspx">contact
          us</a>.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px ! important;">Email
          Choice/Opt-out</h3>
          <p>Members who no longer wish to receive our weekly email updates or
          other email notifications may opt-out of receiving these
          communications by following the instructions contained in the
          applicable email or by logging-in and changing their settings in the

          bottom left of your profile photo on Khmer.be homepage.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px ! important;">Third
          Party Advertising</h3>
          <p>The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to Members by our
          Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may use
          cookies. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer
          each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad
          networks may compile information about where you, or others who are
          using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads
          are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver
          targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to
          you. Khmer.be does not have access to or control of the cookies that
          may be placed on the computer of any Member or other user of the Khmer.be
          website by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.</p>
          <p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Khmer.be only,
          and does not cover the use of cookies by any other party.</p>

          applicable, we attempt to comply with local data protection and
          consumer rights laws. If you are unsure whether this privacy policy is
