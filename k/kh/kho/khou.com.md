KHOU PRIVACY POLICY

**

This Privacy Policy discloses the general privacy practices for www.khou.com.

KHOU is committed to respecting the privacy rights of visitors to any of the KHOU web sites. While visiting KHOU web sites (collectively, the "Site"), we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with the Site. To further the protection of your Personal Information, KHOU has adopted a set of information management guidelines (outlined below) which serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships. These guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. Any such changes will be posted on this page. Please see the Effective Date stated at the conclusion of this Policy.

**Information Collected:**

 ****

**IP Addresses** : KHOU does log IP addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.

  
**Use of Personal Information**

KHOU may match aggregated user information with third party data. Also, KHOU discloses aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to potential advertisers, partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. Additionally, KHOU will use reasonable efforts to ensure that only our employees with a "need to know" will have access to your information. We do not release personal information about you as an individual to third parties.

It should be noted, however, that this Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose any information to other parties, whether through, for example, on-line auctions, chat rooms, personal ads, or the like, or through other web sites throughout the Internet, different policies may apply. Since KHOU does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, of that third party, and KHOU shall not be responsible for the use or dissemination of your private information by that third party. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

**Links to Other Materials**

 ****

If any link is offered connecting you to a third party web site, it is as an accommodation to the respective third party site owner and without charge. Third party sites linked to and from the Site are not necessarily under the control of KHOU. KHOU shall have no responsibilities or liabilities whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such linked site or any link or linking program at any time. KHOU does not necessarily endorse companies (or related products or services) to or from which the Site is linked. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to the Site, you do so entirely at your own risk. KHOU hereby disclaims any rights to trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, copyrights, patents, domain names or other intellectual property interests of third parties.

**

  
Children’s Privacy

**

KHOU cares about the safety of children and their use of the Internet. Therefore, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request or solicit personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. In the event that we receive actual knowledge that we have collected such personal information without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practical.

**

Effective Date and Changes

**

This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 11, 2000. KHOU reserves the right to modify the terms of this policy at any time and in our sole discretion, by posting a change notice to this page. Your continued use of the Site following our posting of a change notice will constitute binding acceptance of those changes.
