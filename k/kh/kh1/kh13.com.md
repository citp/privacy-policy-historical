# Privacy Policy - KH13.com Forum - KH13.com, for Kingdom Hearts

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available in our footer and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

Log files are maintained and analysed of all requests for files on this website's web servers. Log files do not capture personal information but do capture the user's IP address, which is automatically recognised by our web servers.

**Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**Cookies**  
This website does not store any information that would, on its own, allow us to identify individual users of this service without their permission. Any cookies that may be used by this website are used either solely on a per session basis or to maintain user preferences. Cookies are not shared with any third parties.

**Analytics**

We’ve implemented Google Analytics based on Display Advertising (e.g. Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting).

We and third-party vendors, including Google, will use this remarking information and data based on previous visits to our site to serve relevant messages across the web.

You can opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting Google's [Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads). 

Alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

**3rd party cookies**

We uses cookies on our websites in order to provide enhanced functionality to users, such as user accounts and saved preferences. We also use cookies to ensure that you see the most relevant ads and limit the number of times we show you the same advertisements.

If you continue to use this site, we'll assume you are happy to accept these cookies. Some of the adverts carried on our websites are delivered by third party servers and in doing so they may leave cookies on your machine.
