      <h3><span class="bullets1"></span>Privacy Policy<span class="bullets2"></span></h3>
      <p>We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of personal information provided by those visiting and interacting with this website. We hold the privacy of your personal information in the highest regard. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. <br>
        DJUBO recognises the importance of protecting your privacy and our policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site. This policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers’ needs. </p>
      <p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong></p>
      <p>When you visit this website you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis, and website use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our website.</p>
      <p><strong>1. PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU CHOOSE TO PROVIDE</strong></p>
      <p><b>Registration Information.</b> When You register for any of our services or newsletters you will provide us with information about yourself.</p>
      <p><b>Email Information.</b> If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same level of protection for electronic communications as we do for information received by mail and telephone.</p>
      <p><b>Communication with You.</b>Registration or correspondence with us via email constitutes a commercial relationship and implies consent for us to communicate with you regarding our services. We promise to only send you information deemed relevant to our commercial relationship and any email communication you may receive from us highlighting our services, special offers or promotions.</p>
      <p><strong>2. WEBSITE USE INFORMATION</strong></p>
      <p>Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilises a standard technology called “cookies” and web server log files to collect information about how our website is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our website, and the websites visited just before and just after our website.</p>
      <p><b>STORAGE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</b><br>
        The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) on our website, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). When credit card details are collected, we simply pass them on in order to be processed as required. We never permanently store complete credit card details.<br>
        We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it</p>
      <p><b>ACCESS TO COLLECTED INFORMATION</b><br>
        If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it through your DJUBO User account.</p>
      <p><b>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE TO US?</b><br>
        Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, provision of services, monitoring the use of services, marketing and promotional efforts, improvement of our content and service offerings, and customisation of our website’s content, layout, services and other lawful purposes. These activities improve our site and enable us to better tailor it to meet your needs. <br>
        Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or business information will not be shared with parties except as required by law.<br>
        Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our website, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers. </p>
      <p><b>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</b><br>
        A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</p>
      <p><b>HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM COOKIES?</b><br>
        As you visit and browse our website, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our web server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our website and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</p>
      <p><b>IP ADDRESSES</b><br>
        IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you.</p>
      <p><strong>SHARING AND SELLING INFORMATION</strong></p>
      <p>We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested.</p>
      <p><strong>HOW CAN YOU ACCESS AND CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
      <p>You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@djubo.com">info@djubo.com </a> </p>
      <p><strong>WHAT ABOUT LEGALLY COMPELLED DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION?</strong></p>
      <p>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.</p>
      <p><strong>WHAT ABOUT OTHER WEBSITES LINKED TO OUR WEBSITE?</strong></p>
      <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our web site or the information or content contained therein. Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our website. <br>
        Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link on our website, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. </p>
      <p><strong>YOUR CONSENT</strong></p>
      <p>By using our website you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.</p>
      <p><strong>OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</strong></p>
      <p><b>Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our computers in India. The laws on holding personal data in India may be less stringent than the laws of your country of residence or citizenship. </b>To prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
      <p><strong>CHOICE/OPT-IN/OPT-OUT</strong></p>
      <p>This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible. To unsubscribe to any messages you receive send an email expressing your intent at <a href="mailto:info@djubo.com">info@djubo.com </a></p>
      <p><strong>ACQUISITION OR CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP</strong></p>
      <p>In the event that the website (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred.</p>
      <p><strong>POLICY MODIFICATIONS</strong></p>
      <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.
