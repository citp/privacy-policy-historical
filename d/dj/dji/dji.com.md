Thank you for your interest in SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd. and its affiliated companies (“DJI”, “we,” or “us”) and in the various hardware, firmware, software, websites, applications, and services provided by us and on which a link to this Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) is displayed (each, a “Product” or “Service” and, collectively, the “DJI Products and Services”).

This Policy describes:

  * the information that we gather from you,
  * how we use and share this information,
  * the rights and choices you have regarding this information,
  * the steps we take to protect this information,
  * the limitations of this Policy regarding third party websites and content,
  * how we transfer your information,
  * how we may change this Policy, and
  * how you may contact us.



By using DJI Products and Services, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.  This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Terms of Use for the DJI Products and Services you use.

## Information We Collect on the DJI Products and Services

  * User-provided Information. When you use DJI Products and Services, you may provide us with information about you, including your name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, and payment information (if you use DJI Products and Services to engage in purchases or financial transactions). You may provide us with information in various ways when using DJI Products and Services. For example, you provide us with information when you register for a DJI account, use DJI Products and Services, submit credentials or other information for account verification, upload or share photos or videos on or through DJI Products and Services, or send us customer service-related requests using DJI Products and Services or other means of communication. 
  * User-provided Information About Others. We may also collect and store information about other people that you or other users provide to us. If you use DJI Products and Services to send others (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) information that may interest them (such as videos or photos hosted on DJI’s SkyPixel video and photograph hosting and sharing service (“SkyPixel”)) or messages (such as invitations to comment on videos or photos, use DJI Products and Services, or participate an event) through DJI Products and Services, we may store information about you and information relating to each such recipient. Similarly, if you use DJI Products and Services to upload, share and/or distribute content (including user rating information on DJI’s social networking application DJI+ Discover (the “DJI+ Discover App”), photos, videos, flight data, or other submissions), and such content contains information about others, we may store, process, and disclose that information as provided for under this Policy.
  * Cookies and Automatically Collected Information. When you use certain DJI Products and Services, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device.  We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies, you may not be able to utilize the features of DJI Products and Services to their fullest potential. We may use third party cookies as well.  For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data.  DJI does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use DJI Products and Services.

We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs" or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use a Product or Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on a Product or Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use DJI Products and Services. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you.

Our use of cookies and other automatically collected information is explained further in our Cookie Policy.

  * Device-Related and Flight-Related Information.  When you use DJI Products and Services, you will provide us with information relating to (i) your DJI Product or Service, your non-DJI device on which the DJI Product or Service is used (including computers, phones, or other devices where you install or access DJI Products and Services), and your photos or videos that you upload using DJI Products and Services.  This information may include: (i) information about your non-DJI device (including your device ID, hardware version, and operating system); (ii) information about your DJI device (including the model and serial number of your device); (iii) geolocation data relating to your non-DJI device and DJI device and any photo or video you submitted using DJI Products and Services; (iv) information about any photo or video recorded, including the name of the video file, the length of the video, EXIF data relating to the photo or video, and the photo or video data itself; (v) other technical information, including the IP address used by your non-DJI device and flight record data; and (vi) data associated with your DJI account.

When you choose to self-authorize or “unlock” flight operations on DJI hardware control applications (including DJI Go (the “DJI Go App”)) in locations that are categorized by DJI’s Geospatial Environment Online system as raising safety or security issues, we collect and retain geolocation information relating to your decision.  In addition to the Device-Related Information described above, some of the features of DJI Products and Services may enable DJI to access your location in order to tailor your experience with the DJI Products and Services based on your location (“Location-based Services”).  In order to use certain Location-based Services, you may be required to enable certain features of your mobile phone (such as GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth), which enable DJI to identify your location through a variety of means, including GPS location, IP address, cell tower location, geo-fencing technology, or detection by physical on-location Wi-Fi or Bluetooth sensors.  If your location is collected through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth sensors, please be aware that such sensors, and the associated data services, may be provided by a third party, which may access such information for the purpose of providing such data services to DJI.

  * Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons. We may display third-party content on or through DJI Products and Services, including third-party advertising.  We also may enable you to connect your DJI account to, or otherwise interface with, third party services, including third party social networks and communications services.  In addition, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by DJI. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.

[For further information, please review our Cookie Policy.]

  * Information from Other Sources. We may obtain information from third parties and sources other than DJI Products and Services, such as our business partners, contractors, advertisers, and other third parties.
