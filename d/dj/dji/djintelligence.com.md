DJ Intelligence may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

  * DJ Intelligence does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 
    * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with DJ Intelligence under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help DJ Intelligence communicate with you about offers from DJ Intelligence and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
    * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of DJ Intelligence's terms of service, or as otherwise required by law.
    * We transfer information about you if DJ Intelligence is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, DJ Intelligence will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  * DJ Intelligence displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 
    * DJ Intelligence does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
    * DJ Intelligence advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).
