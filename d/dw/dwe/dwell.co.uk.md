# Your personal data & our privacy policy - dwell

Coin Furniture Limited (trading as dwell) takes the privacy of its customers very seriously and the security of your personal information is extremely important to us. 

This policy together with our dwell Cookie Policy and our Website Terms of Use sets out what information we collect about you, and how it will be used and stored by us when you use our website, contact us electronically, visit our stores or contact us by telephone. 

By making a purchase of goods or services from dwell, or providing your contact details to us in store, visiting dwell.co.uk, registering an account, placing an order or by communicating with dwell online or by telephone you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this policy. 

When we say ‘we’, ‘our’, ‘us’ or ‘dwell’ in this policy we are referring to Coin Furniture Limited 

For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679), the data controller is Coin Furniture Limited. 1 Rockingham Way Redhouse Interchange, Adwick-Le-Street, Doncaster, England, DN6 7NA. Registered number 08586227 (England and Wales). 

When you place an order with dwell in store, via our order-line or on our website, the information that we collect and store relating to you is primarily used to enable us to provide our products and services to you. This is to ensure that we can carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us. 

In some cases we use third party delivery services such as Royal Mail. Your name, address and contact details may also be shared with third party delivery contractors to ensure that we can fulfil our contractual arrangement with you to deliver the products and services you purchase from us. 

Dwell hold this information for a period of 10 years. After this period we will archive permanently any inactive customer accounts. Should you request us to, we will anonymise your information removing all identifiers i.e. names and addresses connected to any transactions you have made with us. 

If you choose to contact us using the chat functions enabled on our website, this is supported by a selected third party provider who will store details of the chat securely on their own servers for 12 weeks. 

If you request a service or a repair from us this will be completed by a third party at which point we will share your name and address details with our third party repair provider who will use this only for providing you with the repair service. 

If you provide information to us about any person other than yourself, you must ensure that they understand how their information will be used and that they have given their permission for you to disclose it to us and for you to allow us to use it for the purposes discussed with you e.g. to arrange for delivery of the furniture. 

If you choose to communicate with us by telephone, this information will be stored for our records and will be retained securely for 26 weeks. 

If you use our website to register an account, participate in discussion boards, enter a competition, complete a survey, request a call back from customer services or report a problem with our products and services, the information you provide to us will be stored and may be used to facilitate that request or service. 

**Finance Applications:** If you wish to enter into a finance agreement to purchase furniture, we will facilitate this for you by offering a direct link through to a finance provider who we have agreed agreements with. We do not hold or have access to any information you supply to the finance provider. Those finance providers are third party data controllers and are therefore responsible for any information that you provide to them. Dwell enable you to set up a direct relationship with these providers. The third party finance providers may, for example, ask credit reference agencies about you, keep records to help them decide whether to grant credit and to provide you with finance. 

Once the finance company have accepted your application for finance, dwell only keep records in relation to which finance provider you have entered into an arrangement with in order to finance your purchase with us as well as the loan terms and the value of the finance requested. If an initial provider approached decides not to offer you a finance agreement, we will pass your information to alternative providers who may carry out their own credit searches. The finance providers with whom dwell works are V12 Retail Finance Limited (Secure Trust Bank Plc) and Omni Capital Retail Finance Ltd (Omni). Details about their own privacy policies are available on request. 

  * **Information dwell receives from other sources:** We may also collect information about you from other sources, and combine such information with information we hold about you, including where:
    * We communicate with members of your family or your household in relation to provision of our services or products (for example, to arrange for delivery);
    * Our trusted partners have collected information about you, and you have consented to disclosure to us. For example, you may have entered a competition with a third party and given your consent for your details to be shared with dwell for the purposes of entering a prize draw or receiving a product discount;
    * Information is available about you publicly, or is aggregated or anonymised by a third party. For example, we may apply demographic analysis of your postcode such as average household size, and average income, and the general location;
    * You provide information to us through your use or interaction with our social media channels. 

Under the GDPR we must have a lawful reason for using (or 'processing') your personal information. One of the lawful reasons is 'legitimate interests'. Legitimate Interests means that we can process your personal information if we have a genuine and legitimate reason and we are not harming any of your rights and interests in doing so. 

So, what does this mean? When you provide your personal details to us, we use your information for our legitimate business interests to ensure we can provide you with the best service possible and help us ensure you only receive relevant information from us. 

Before doing this, though, we will also carefully consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights. 

Some typical examples of when we might use the approach are for preventing fraud, direct marketing, maintaining the security of our system, data analytics, enhancing, modifying or improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our advertising. 

We will process the personal information you have supplied to us to conduct and manage our business to enable us to give you the most appropriate marketing, information, service and products and provide the best and most secure experience. These are what we consider our 'Legitimate Interests 

**Our interests**

The following are when and why we would use this approach: 

**Direct Marketing:** If you purchased from us prior to the 1st March 2018 and have not unsubscribed from receiving marketing information, we will send you emails, SMS and postal marketing, which relates to relevant promotions and offers that we feel will be of interest to you. If you purchased from us after the above date we will only send you emails and SMS marketing which relates to relevant promotions and offers that we feel will be of interest to you if you have actively consented to receiving it. 

This information will be shared with partners, suppliers, and agencies so they can process your personal information on our behalf. We only share information that allows them to provide their services to us or to facilitate them providing their services to you. For example, some of our service providers place advertising for us online, about our products and services. 

As a result, where you have indicated you are happy to receive marketing from us, due to cookies you might see online advertising that we have placed on the web sites you visit, or the interactive services you use.

This information will be stored for 30 days before being deleted. 

**Customer Service surveys:** When you place an order with us, we will share your name and contact details with our chosen third parties who will contact you on our behalf to conduct Customer Service surveys by email. These surveys allow us to review the customer experience and allow us to provide improved customer service and are not marketing.

These surveys contain no promotional material or marketing messages however if you do not want to receive further surveys you can opt out on receipt of them. These third parties will store your email address if you choose to unsubscribe to ensure that they do not send you further surveys on our behalf. 

**Analytics:** We process your personal information, collected as part of your furniture purchases for the purposes of customer analysis, assessment, profiling and direct marketing. This may be on a personalised or aggregated basis, to help us with our activities and to provide you with the most relevant information as long as this does not harm any of your rights and interests.
