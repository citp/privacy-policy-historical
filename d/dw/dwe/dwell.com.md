# Privacy Policy - Dwell

Thank you for visiting the Dwell magazine website. On this site, we want to provide you with information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, help you protect your privacy. This notice explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected and used.

## The Types of Information We Collect

From time to time at this site, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls, subscribe to one of our services, or participate in our online forums or communities. When you do any of these things, we ask you for personally identifiable information such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.

You may also occasionally submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to order a gift or gift subscription online. If you want it sent directly to the recipient, you may submit the recipient's name, address, and telephone number.

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). We may collect your Internet Protocol address ("IP address"), which is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet service provider, your company or your university.

## How We Use the Information

We use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you, or to contact you about your account with us.

We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer products, programs, or services to them.

If you submit content for publication (for example, a letter to our editors), we may publish your name and other information you have provided to us.

The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer products, programs, or services.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad demographic information, and administer our website.

We will disclose information in our database when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.

We allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services such as technical maintenance or forums software, but only for the purpose of providing those services. If you choose to purchase items through our site, we may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment. There are also times when you provide information about yourself to us in areas of the site that are managed or participated in by third parties, such as our featured merchant partners. In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third parties, each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. While we will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, Dwell LLC. does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties.

We do not rent or sell our users' e-mail addresses. However, unless you request otherwise, we may rent or share your name and address with carefully selected companies who we believe can offer you services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your information shared, write to us at [privacy@dwell.com](mailto:privacy@dwell.com). If you do not wish to receive online marketing communications or our newsletter from us, write to us at [privacy@dwell.com](mailto:privacy@dwell.com) or simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the e-mail. This site will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.
