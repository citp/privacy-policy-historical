**What information does Design Within Reach collect?**

When making a purchase through our Site, we collect your name, billing address, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card information, in order to process your order. Therefore when you visit our Site to place subsequent orders we can save you time by providing your previous account information for you. If you request a catalog, we collect your name, mailing address and e-mail address. Once we have collected an email address, we send our weekly email newsletter informing you of news and our special product offers. You are welcome to visit our Site without providing any of this information; however, we are unable to process an order or send a catalog or newsletter without the requested information.

We use cookies, which is a feature of your browser used to assign identification to your computer. The unique user ID contained within your cookie automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers every time you visit our site. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user, but may be correlated with identity information in our log files. You can decline cookies through your browser preference options, but you may not be able to use some of our services properly as a result, such as the option to save your user name and password.

We also collect the IP address of visitors to our Site, and collect aggregate information about the use of our Site. All information described in this section entitled "What information does Design Within Reach collect" constitutes "Data" for purposes of this Privacy Policy.

In every such e-mail, we will have instructions on how to unsubscribe and avoid receiving any future e-mails from us. Please see our Opt Out section below.

We also may combine information you have provided to us in communications offline - such as information related to your catalog subscription and orders - with the Data you have given us online, to provide a more customized experience for you when you visit our Site.
