###  How we Protect Information 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

We will delete any information provided to us by a User upon the receipt of a written request by such User. We cannot restore information that we have deleted.

We display such User Content that you upload on the Site and/or Services. 

In addition, by analyzing all information we receive, including all information concerning Users, we may compile statistical information across a variety of platforms and Users (“Statistical Information”). Statistical Information helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. Statistical Information is anonymous and we will not link Statistical Information to any Personal Information. We may share such Statistical Information with our partners, without restriction, on commercial terms that we can determine in our sole discretion. We may provide non-Personal Information that we receive to Google Analytics in order to receive an analysis of the use of our Site and Services.
