Daddies Board Shop Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is a top priority to us. We are in the business of selling skateboard and snowboard gear, not names or personal information. Daddiesboardshop.com has created this privacy policy in order to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site. 

What we collect: 

We may collect your name, address and phone number. We will need this information to complete and process your order. This information is viewed only by the owners and employees of daddiesboardshop.com if they are involved in the completion, delivery or customer support of your order. How this information is used: The order is processed and kept in our confidential files for record-keeping purposes. All paper data is destroyed via Docu-Shred on a bi-monthly basis. 

Credit Card information. Your credit card is charged as you submit your order only for the amount you have approved. Refunds for returned products or unavailable items are processed with the same credit card that was provided in the original order. At no point does Daddies Board Shop possess the full credit card number unless given to it during a manual transaction, such as a phone order. A short period of time after the order is processed, the credit card information is purged from the order. 

Email address and phone number. We require your e-mail address and phone number to contact you if we have a question regarding your order. This information may be disclosed to trusted persons working together with daddiesboardshop.com if they are involved in the completion, delivery or customer support of your order. We will NEVER call your phone number if it is not related to your order. How this information is used: Customers that place an order may receive notifications of new arrivals, discounts and updated information from our web site. You may "Opt Out" of receiving these emails by using the "Unsubscribe Me" link at the bottom of every e-mail. Customer Service may also use your email address to contact you about abandoned shopping carts or uncompleted orders. 

Cookies. Cookies are a message that a web server transmits to a web browser to personalize the user's experience on our web site. Cookies can help store personal information about you so that when you return to the site you have a more personalized experience. Have you ever returned to a site and have seen your name mysteriously appear on the screen? It is because on a previous visit you gave your name to the site and it was stored in a cookie so that when you returned you would be greeted with a personal message.

All browsers can be set to reject cookies if the user prefers to use the Internet without enabling cookies to be stored.

Legal Disclosure

We reserve the right to monitor, and disclose to, government officials or law enforcement, without your consent, any communications and personally identifiable information, whenever prompted to do so by legal authorities, even when you have requested that your information not be disclosed to third parties. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. The contents of daddiesboardshop.com are provided "AS IS" and may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current (we strive for 100% accuracy but we are only human).

Daddies Wood Shop Privacy Policy

Daddies Board Shop, LLC ("Daddies”) owns and provides the Daddies Wood Shop website located at daddiesboardshop.com/woodshop (the "Network”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully because it governs your use of the Network and services accessible via the website, collectively the "Services.” This Privacy Policy pertains to the Daddies Wood Shop. 

Summary  
The Privacy Policy explains what information is collected and how it is used. Your privacy is important and the goal of this Privacy Policy is to be as simple and non-technical as possible. 

What Information is Collected and How

Technical information is collected when you interact with the Network  
Like almost all websites or mobile applications, the Network may create and record certain information in an automated way. For example, when you use the Network, its servers may automatically record information about your interaction with its products ("Log Data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. Log Data may include the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to the Network, your Internet Protocol address, the date and time of your request, browser type and settings, and how you interacted with the Network. 

The Network may also use "cookies” (a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes), or similar technologies to record Log Data. When cookies are used, the Network may use "session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, the Network may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Network settings so you don’t have to set them up every time you visit the Network. 

The Network may also collect information about the device you’re using when accessing the Network, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether the Network collects some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider. 

Information is collected when you give it, or give permission to collect it  
When you sign up for or use the Network’s Services, you may voluntarily share certain information. This can include information such as your name, profile photo, comments, email address, and any other information you provide. 

How Information is Used  
Information collected is used to provide the Services to you and make them better, develop new Services, and protect the Network and its users. 

The information collected may be "personally identifiable” (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or "non-personally identifiable” (meaning it can’t be used to specifically identify you). The Network uses both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. 

Daddies also may disclose personal information about you, without notice: (i) in response to requests from local, state or federal law enforcement officials; (ii) if requested by any judicial, administrative or similar proceeding or order, such as a subpoena; or (iii) if otherwise required by law. 

How Information is Shared  
If you provide the Network with personal information, that information may be used to alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle your customer service questions or issues; request feedback; and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that may interest you. Daddies reserves the right to offer third party services and products to you based on the information that you supply and the preferences that you identify in your registration and at any time thereafter; such offers may be made by Daddies or by third parties. 

Your personal information may be used with non-personal information that was collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user. Your personal information may be made non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant Daddies a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data collected (the "Analytical Data”). 

Children’s Privacy  
The Network is not intended for children under 13, and personal information from children under 13 will not knowingly be collected. Children’s privacy is a serious matter and parents are encouraged to play an active role in their children’s online experience at all times. 

Consent  
By using the Network, you consent to the collection and use of this information by the Network. 

Notification of Changes  
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all such changes will be posted on this page. 

Terms of Use  
Please read the Terms of Service governing the use of the Network.
