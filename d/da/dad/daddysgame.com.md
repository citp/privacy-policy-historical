### Sharing your information with us and others

When you first access the App, for example by clicking on a link to a Application from your Facebook newsfeed, you will be presented with a Facebook permissions page, which will advise you about the Facebook information you will be sharing with the App and other Facebook users. You can then decide whether or not to share your Facebook information by using the App. If you decide not to grant permission you will not be able to use the App.

By granting permission you will be agreeing to share your Facebook user details (including your name, profile picture, user ID and any other information you choose to share according to your Facebook account settings) as well as the user details of your Facebook friends, and information about your use of the App, for example, the articles you are reading.

If you choose to post content or other data on the App, for example, by commenting on an article, this can be accessed by all of your Facebook friends.

If you decide not to share information with your Facebook friends about a particular article you have accessed you can make your reading private using the “remove from timeline” facility at the top of the article page.
