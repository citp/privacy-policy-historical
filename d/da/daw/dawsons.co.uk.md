If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to use your personal data in this manner.

We may process your personal data (without your knowledge or consent) where this is required or permitted by law.

#### Disclosure of personal data to third parties

For the purposes of providing services to you (for example, to arrange delivery of your purchases) we may share your personal data with third parties, further details of which are set out in the Schedule: Part 3. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes. They can only process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. Our third-party service providers, for example IT service providers, may process personal data outside of the EEA; we agree appropriate contractual terms with such parties to ensure that your data is processed in accordance with the principles of EU and UK law.

We do not control third party websites or portals such as those operated by finance partners and you should read their privacy notices to understand how they will use your personal data.

#### Data security

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. We also limit access to your personal data to those employees and persons who have a business need to know and they only process your personal data on our instructions and subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

#### Data retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us. For legal reasons we keep basic information about our customers (including contact, identity, financial and transaction data) for six years after they cease being customers.

#### Your legal rights

You have certain rights in relation to your personal data. These are set out in the Schedule: Part 4. If you wish to exercise any of your rights, please contact our DPM.

You will not have to pay a fee to exercise any of your rights. However, if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for this information or refuse to comply with your request.

We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity when you contact us. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who does not have the right to receive it.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month to deal with your request if it is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
