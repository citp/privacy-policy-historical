# Privacy Policy • Damn Interesting

## Summary

We hate spam (in the context of unsolicited advertisements, we have no official stance on the potted meat product). We dislike advertising in general, but spam…boy-howdy do we resent its very existence. If you sign up for a user account on damninteresting.com, we’ll send occasional automated emails when absolutely necessary (e.g., to reset a password). Apart from that, we will never send you any unsolicited messages, we’ll only ever email you things you sign up for, and we’ll stop doing that at once if you unsubscribe.

We will never willingly share your personal information with anyone. We have no desire to do so. We’re so averse to intrusive marketing that we don’t even put ads on our own site. We’ll store your email address, username and IP address if you create an account or leave a comment, but we will not share that data with anybody unless forced to do so by law, nor will we use for anything apart from account maintenance. We also track traffic via Google Analytics, but only cumulative statistics and referral data, not for advertising or anything gross like that.

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service.

**Information Collection And Use**

While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you.

Our service requires all visitors to use encrypted SSL HTTPS connections.

**Comments**

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our Service’s functionality. These third party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information.

**Contact forms**

Contact forms on our site generate a formatted email that is sent to the appropriate email address on damninteresting.com. The submitted data is not collected in a local database. We do not use the information submitted through contact forms for marketing purposes.

**Cookies**

**Compliance With Laws**
