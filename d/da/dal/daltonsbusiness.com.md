**PRIVACY POLICY OVERVIEW**

Thank you for visiting DaltonsBusiness.com. We are committed to protecting your right to privacy as a consumer of our online services. We collect information about our users in order to help us continually improve the services we offer and so that we can enter into commercial arrangements, including the sale of advertising space. DaltonsBusiness.com will always adhere to UK Data Protection Legislation. This Privacy Policy only relates to the DaltonsBusiness.com service and does not extend to your use of the Internet outside of the DaltonsBusiness.com site. The information you provide to us will be held on DaltonsBusiness.com's web servers, computers that are based in the UK.

**DATA COLLECTION**

_What data do we collect?_

We will collect the personal data you provide to us during the registration process, which you agree to supply to us accurately. We will also collect personal data from other parts of the DaltonsBusiness.com service, e.g. from competition entrants. 

We do not monitor your use of the Internet but we do use cookie technology to monitor your use of the DaltonsBusiness.com service. This information is not stored alongside your personal data. You can find out more about this on our [cookie policy page](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy "Cookie Policy"). 

We may hold personal data relating to the transactions you enter into with DaltonsBusiness.com or others through the website, or your activity on the website. We may from time to time also ask for other data so that we can obtain a better understanding of our users and their requirements. This information will help us to sell appropriate advertising space and provide better personalised services for our users.

You may also supply us with other people's email addresses, for example, if you use our "email a friend" facility. We do not store or use email addresses gathered in this manner for any other reason, and we will never use email addresses obtained in this manner for marketing purposes.

_What do we do with it?_

We may use personal information about you to build up a profile of our visitors' interests and preferences and to build a demographic profile of our user base in order to target our own advertising more effectively. 

When you supply us with your details you consent to receive email newsletters or other information, sometimes by post, which may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to give your consent, you can un-tick the "Send me marketing messages" checkbox on the 'My Profile' page of your "My Daltons" area. If this box is ticked, we consider you to have given us your permission to contact you from time to time to promote our site and services. We may sell advertising on the emails we send you,  and may use our aggregate site profile to aid us in this activity. 

**Collection of information by third parties**
