People are cautioned that the collection of personal information provided by any individual in an email will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may, if not protected by federal or State law, be subject to public access. The County encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children's Internet activities and guide the children whenever children are asked to provide personal information on-line.
