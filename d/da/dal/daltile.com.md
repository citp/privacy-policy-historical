# Privacy & Security Practices for Sites Operated by Daltile

This Privacy Policy explains the privacy and security practices for any website, application, mobile browser, social media account, or service operated by Dal-Tile Distribution, Inc., or any of its subsidiaries, divisions, affiliates, or related companies (“Dal-Tile”, “we”, “us”, “our” as appropriate) that links to this Privacy Policy (collectively, our “sites”), and it applies to any individual that uses or accesses any site.  

We are the world’s largest flooring company with flooring options in over 30 categories.  This policy applies to our corporate operations and our businesses that are headquartered in the United States.  Our businesses located outside of the United States maintain their own privacy policies that are subject to local law.  Please refer to the policy of the local business whenever you are engaging with a Dal-Tile affiliate that is headquartered outside of the United States.  We want you to understand the terms and conditions surrounding our collection, use, sharing, storage, and retention of your information through the sites.
