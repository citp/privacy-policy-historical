        <br><h1>Privacy Statement for Musictoday</h1><br>
        			Musictoday has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Musictoday and all other Web sites powered by Musictoday, including the Dave Matthews Band Official Website.
        			<br><br>
        			We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. 
        			<br><br>
        			Musictoday uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart in the stores and to keep track of your membership status on the Web site. We use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. The cookies we use only track your currently logged in status or your shopping cart status. 
        			<br><br>
        			Our registration form requires users to give us contact information (name and e-mail address) and demographic information (zip code and date of birth). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and about companies we choose. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary and may be shared with other select companies who want to contact the user. Users may opt-out of receiving mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. We do not share mailing address, credit card, or any personally identifiable information (other than e-mail address and date of birth) with other companies. Demographic and profile data are used only for personalized Web content and statistical information and are not shared with other companies except in ways that do not personally identify our users. 
        			<br><br>
        			This site contains links to other sites. Musictoday is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We place advertising on our site that originates from third party advertisers and/or advertising agencies. Even though these advertisements are embedded in our Web site, cookies may be assigned by the advertisers themselves. Musictoday does not control those cookies. 
        			<br><br>
        			Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (e-mail address) and financial information (credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send our customers’ orders and information about our company and about companies we choose. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary and may be shared with other select companies who want to contact the user. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial and contact information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services and may be shared with companies that help us operate our site, such as the credit card companies that we use. 
        			<br><br>
        			Musictoday runs contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (e-mail address) and demographic information (zip code and date of birth). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company and about companies we choose. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary and may be shared with other select companies who want to contact the user. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. We may share your contact and demographic information with the contest prize providers or third parties. 
        			<br><br>
        			Musictoday provides online ticketing to venues and artists in which we ask customers for contact information (e-mail, mailing and billing addresses). We use customer contact information from the order form to send the user information about events, our company and about companies we choose. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the customer about event specific details when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Musictoday may provide your contact information to the venues, artists and/or promoters of the events for which you purchase tickets. By purchasing tickets, you acknowledge that Musictoday has no control over and is not responsible for the privacy policies of those venues, artists or promoters or their subsequent use of your contact information. 
        			<br><br>
        			In addition, Musictoday collects and stores statistics and other information about the online activities of our users on an aggregated (collected) basis. For example, we track the number of people who view each page, the order in which pages are viewed, and other information to learn which features are the most popular and to refine our design and marketing efforts. 
        			<br><br>
        			You agree that Musictoday may assign, sell, license or otherwise transfer to a third party your personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of Musictoday, inc. or its affiliated entities. 
        			<br><br>
        			We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.
