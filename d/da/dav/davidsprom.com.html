		<br><span class="privacyheader">A special note concerning children's privacy: </span>
		<br>
		<br>The safety of children is very important to us. We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child has provided one of our Web sites with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian send us an email at <a href="mailto:remove@davidsbridal.net">remove@davidsbridal.net</a>, and we will delete the information about the child from our files. 
		<br>
		<br><hr noshade="" size="1" color="#cccccc">
		<br><span class="privacyheader">Is there anything else I should know about Internet privacy? </span>
		<br>
		<br>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information online-for example on message boards, through email or in chat areas-that information can be collected and used by others. In addition, the privacy policies of other web sites will vary, while some may have no stated privacy policy.   
		<br>
		<br>In short, if you provide personally identifiable information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. It is ultimately your responsibility to maintain the secrecy of your personally identifiable information to the extent you feel comfortable. We encourage you to be careful and to ask questions before you disclose your personally identifiable information to others, and to read the posted privacy policy of  every site you visit, whether you are linking from our website or browsing on your own.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
