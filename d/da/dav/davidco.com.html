<p style="font-weight: bold;">WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. INTRODUCTION.</span> The David Allen Company ("us," "we," or "Company") is committed to  respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other  users of the Company Website (the "Site").We created this Website  Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to give you confidence as you visit  and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information  practices and the protection of privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">2.1. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(a) TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTED.</span> We automatically track and collect the following categories of  information when you visit our Site: (1) IP addresses; (2) domain  servers; (3) types of computers accessing the Site; (4) types of web  browsers used to access the Site; (5) referring site; (6) pages visited  on the Site; and (7) the duration of your visit to the Site (your  "Session") (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous  information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for  marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Site. We also  use "cookies" to customize content specific to your interests, and to  store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you  visit the Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(b) PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED.</span> In order for you to access certain premium services and to purchase  products that we offer via the Site, we require you to provide us with  certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal  Information"). Personal Information includes the following categories of  information: (1) Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address, and  e-mail address); (2) Financial Data (such as your account or credit card  number); and (3) Demographic Data (such as your zip code, age, and  income). If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of  our chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete  online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in  such communication may be collected as Personal Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">2.2. USES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(a) USE OF INFORMATION.</span> We may use Contact Data to send you information about the Company or  our products or services, or promotional material from some of our  partners, or to contact you when necessary. We may use your Financial  Data to verify your qualifications for certain products or services and  to bill you for products and services. We may use your Demographic Data  to customize and tailor your experience on the site, displaying content  that we think you might be interested in and according to your  preferences. Third party vendors, including Google, show our ads on the  internet, and use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to  this Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(b) SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. </span>We  share certain categories of information we collect from you in the ways  described in this Privacy Policy. We share Demographic Data with  advertisers and other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e.,  non-personally-identifiable) basis. We do not currently share Contact  Data with other companies or third parties for any purpose other than  our own Company purposes. In the event we do wish to share Contact Data  with other companies who may want to send you information about their  products or services, you will be given the opportunity to request that  we not share your Contact Data with such companies, by accessing your  personal profile and "opting out," as described in Section 3.1, below.  We reserve the right to share Contact Data and Financial Data with  business partners to assist us by performing core services (such as  hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to  our business activities and/or operation of the Site. If we do share any  such data with business partners, we will require those business  partners to agree to uphold the same standards of security and  confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and  they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to  carry out their specific business obligations to the Company. By  choosing to provide us with Personal Information for a particular  purpose, such as providing us with Contact Data and/or Financial Data to  make a purchase from the Site, you authorize us to share such  information with business partners to the extent this is necessary to  carry out the purpose for which you shared the information. If you do  not want us to share your Contact Data with any third parties, please  email us at <a href="mailto:websupport@davidco.com">websupport@davidco.com</a>, but please understand that such a  request will likely limit your ability to take advantage of all of the  features and services we offer on the Site. In addition, we maintain a  procedure for you to review and request changes to your Personal  Information; this procedure is described in Section 3.1, below. If you  link to another website through our Site, or purchase a product or  service from a third party through an advertisement on our Site, you  authorize us and such third party to track your usage and/or exchange  any Personal Information you may provide directly or indirectly through  your use of the Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(c) USER CHOICE REGARDING COLLECTION, USE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</span> You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such  an event, you can still access and use much of the Site; however you  will not be able to access and use those portions of the Site that  require your Personal Information. If you do not wish to receive  information and promotional material from us or from some of our  partners, you may select the appropriate "opt-out" option each time we  ask for your Personal Information. If you do elect to provide us with  Personal Information, we may use that information for any of the  purposes identified above, unless you have specifically chosen to  "opt-out." You may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google advertising opt-out page</a>, or you can opt out of Google and other third party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;opt out page</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</span> Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your  Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties  unless you authorize us to do so, or unless such disclosure is necessary  to: (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect  our rights or property; or (c) enforce our Terms of Use. We take  commercially reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information  from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or  destruction. Your Personal Information is stored on secure servers that  are not accessible by third parties. We transmit sensitive information,  such as credit card information, via secured channels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1. USER ABILITY TO ACCESS, UPDATE, AND CORRECT PERSONAL INFORMATION.</span> We maintain a procedure in order to help you confirm that your Personal  Information remains correct and up-to-date. At any time, you may visit  your personal profile at &lt;<a href="https://secure.davidco.com/store/register.php?mode=update">secure.davidco.com/store/register.php?mode=update</a>&gt;.  Through your personal profile you may review and update your Personal  Information that we have already collected, and choose whether or not  you wish us to send you information about our company.In the event we  wish to send you promotional material from some of our partners or share  your Personal Information with third parties, we will also give you the  opportunity to choose whether or not you wish for us to do so. If you  wish to contact us regarding your Personal Information, you may do so by  e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:websupport@davidco.com">websupport@davidco.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.2. LOST OR STOLEN INFORMATION.</span> Please notify us promptly at <a href="mailto:websupport@davidco.com">websupport@davidco.com</a> if your credit  card, user name, or password is lost, stolen, or used without  permission. In such an event, we will remove that credit card number,  user name, or password from your account and update our records  accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.3. PUBLIC INFORMATION.</span> The Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible  for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We may also  make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to  you. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these  areas becomes public information. We have no control over its use and  you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal  Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY.</span> We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to,  change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such  change, update, or modification on the Site and without any other notice  to you. Any such change, update, or modification will be effective  immediately upon posting on the Site.</p>
