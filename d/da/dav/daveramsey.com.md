## Our Policy Behind Our Privacy Policy

We refuse to make you read through pages and pages of boring text about a policy that does nothing but trick you into _not_ reading it. Because we have every intention of protecting your privacy, we have made our privacy policy clear and concise enough that you will read it and feel comfortable using our site. We're here to help you, not put you to sleep!

Respecting the privacy and the security of your personal information is important to us. We realize that providing us with personal information is an act of trust. Therefore, we have created a Privacy Policy to show you the steps we have taken to secure that trust. Please take a few moments to read this policy carefully.

## Collected Information

In certain instances, you may be asked to provide personal information on our site. This information is for administrative use only. We use it to better understand and serve your needs and provide services tailored to you.

## Use of Information

We do not use your information for any purpose without your consent. Your information will not be accessible to anyone other than our staff or business partners whose services you have requested. This information is specifically used by our partners to provide you with services you have requested and is not redistributed in any way. All that to say, we won’t sell your information to all the spammers that clutter your inbox!

We make every effort to keep you informed of our own special events, news and offers. Periodically, we send announcements via email or direct mail. If you do not wish to be contacted by our office, simply click on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email newsletter.

_Note: We’ll have to hand over the information you provide if we’re ordered to do so by a court of law._

## Security

We are determined to keep your information private. We have even added measures to protect your personal information during transactions. For example, when you supply us with your debit card or checking account information to make a purchase, we encrypt your information to ensure a safe and secure transaction. Your payment information is temporarily stored on a secure server before processing.

All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. We use vendors that specialize in providing secure online payment solutions. None of your payment information can be accessed via the internet. Hey, we buy things online, too, so we understand how important this issue is to you!
