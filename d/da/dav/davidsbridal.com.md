  * If you make a purchase at this website, we will also ask you for your credit card number, a shipping address and a telephone number for that shipping address, and for any additional information that may be required to personalize the product you purchase.
  * If you contact customer service, we will ask you for your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, order number and such other information as you wish to submit to us for our assistance.
  * If you submit a wedding story, we will ask you for your email address, the names of the bride and groom, and the date and location of the wedding, and we will collect such information as you may include in the wedding story and photos that you submit to us.

Please note that registration is required to browse our online catalogs and make a purchase at this website, post a product review, or use certain additional features of this website, such as the "My Favorites" and "Dress Your Wedding" features. Registration also allows us to send you information about special events and offers, and other information custom-tailored to your needs.

 **Automatic Information:** We use a third party advertising company to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. To help make our information more useful to our visitors, we may collect non-identifying information about your visits to our web site, and about your interaction with our ads. For example, we may keep track of how many of our ads you had seen before visiting our site, how you were directed to our site, how you navigate around it and which products you browse, as well as your purchasing activities. To do this, we use technology such as cookies, action tags, Web Beacons or GIF tags, which we may place at various sections within our web site. We do not collect any personally identifiable information through the use of this technology.

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Our site uses cookies to make sure you are not shown the same content repeatedly, to deliver information that is specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

 **Information from Other Sources** : For reasons such as improving personalization of our service (for example, providing product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

David's Bridal, Inc. is located in the United States and operates this site from the United States. Any information that you provide to us will be transferred out of your country of residence to the United States. By providing personal information to us, you are consenting to its transfer to and storage in the United States and to its use and disclosure as described in this privacy policy. We adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles as established by the U.S. Department of Commerce and approved by the European Commission. Our [Safe Harbor Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20110521085809id_/http%3A//www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/misc?contentName=/Footer/eu_safeharbor_privacy) provides additional information on this subject.

David's Bridal does not directly accept product orders from outside the United States on this site or by telephone. Effective as of December 1, 2009, if you attempt to make a purchase from outside the United States on this site, and you reside in a country that is serviced for us by our partner, E4X, Inc. (who also does business under the name "FiftyOne"), we will refer the order to the website of E4X, at which you will be required to submit certain credit card and personal information to E4X to complete your order.

We do, however, require that customers residing outside the United States create an account with David's Bridal in order to make a purchase from E4X. To create that account, we ask you for certain personal information, including your first and last names, street address, telephone number, email address and event date. We provide your personal information to E4X so that it may fulfill your order. While E4X maintains its own data protection practices, it has assured us that it will process personal data of residents of the EU with at least the same level of privacy protection as set forth in the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.

For example, if you contact our customer service, we will ask you for your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, order number and such other information as you wish to submit to us for our assistance.

You may elect at any time not to provide personal information to us, but in that event you may not be able to make a purchase of our products from E4X. You may also request that we remove you from our mailing list, as described below.

 **A note to residents of Canada**

When you visit a David's Bridal store in Canada and provide personal information to the store or provide personal information through this website, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this policy. When you provide us with information about your groom/bridal party, we expect you have obtained consent from them to do so and that they understand their information will be treated in accordance with this policy and may be shared with Our Wedding Day.com and Moores The Suit People, Inc. d/b/a Moores Clothing for Men. We expect you will not provide information to us about your groom/bridal party if you do not have their consent. As explained above, because David's Bridal operates in the United States, any information provided through this website or through a store in Canada may be processed in the United States, where privacy laws may offer different levels of protection from those in Canada and personal information may be subject to access by and disclosure to law enforcement agencies in the United States.

David's Bridal recognizes your ability to access and review your personal information held by us and will endeavor to provide the information in question within a reasonable time and no later than 30 days following the written request. We will provide information from our records in a form that is easy to understand. We may charge a reasonable cost (e.g. photocopying, mail charges) when a request is made. David's Bridal may refuse to provide access to personal information where the information requested:

  (a) Would disclose (i) personal information of another individual or a deceased individual; or (ii) trade secrets or other confidential business information that may harm David's Bridal or the competitive position of a third party or interfere with contractual or other negotiations of David's Bridal or a third party or result in a significant financial loss or gain to David's Bridal or a third party;   
  (b) Is not readily retrievable and the burden or cost of providing would be disproportionate to the nature or value of the information;   
  (c) Is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege;   
  (d) Does not exist, is not held, or cannot be found by David's Bridal;   
  (e) Could reasonably result in serious harm to the treatment or recovery of the individual concerned or another individual, serious emotional harm to the individual or another individual or serious bodily harm to the individual or another individual;   
  (f) May harm or interfere with law enforcement activities and other investigative or regulatory functions of a body authorized by law to perform such functions, or;   
  (g) Any other grounds under applicable legislation.

Where information will not or cannot be disclosed, the individual making the request will be provided with the reasons for non-disclosure.

David's Bridal will not respond to repetitive or vexatious requests for access. To guard against fraudulent requests for access, David's Bridal may require sufficient information to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request before granting access.

Requests for access should be submitted to the Privacy Officer, [privacyCA@dbi.com](mailto:privacyCA@dbi.com) or by writing to Privacy Officer, David's Bridal, P.O. Box 549, Conshohocken, PA 19428, U.S.A.

**A special note concerning children's privacy:**

The safety of children is very important to us. We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child has provided one of our Web sites with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian send us an email at [remove@dbi.com](mailto:remove@dbi.com) or to [removeCA@dbi.com](mailto:removeCA@dbi.com) for our Canadian customers, and we will delete the information about the child from our files.

 **Is there anything else I should know about Internet privacy?**

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information online-for example on message boards, through email or in chat areas-that information can be collected and used by others. In addition, the privacy policies of other web sites will vary, while some may have no stated privacy policy.

In short, if you provide personally identifiable information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. It is ultimately your responsibility to maintain the secrecy of your personally identifiable information to the extent you feel comfortable. We encourage you to be careful and to ask questions before you disclose your personally identifiable information to others, and to read the posted privacy policy of every site you visit, whether you are linking from our website or browsing on your own.

 **Your consent and changes to our privacy policy:**

By using our web site, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of the information you provide in accordance with this policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. If you would like to be removed from our mailing list, please send an email to [remove@dbi.com](mailto:remove@dbi.com) or to [removeCA@dbi.com](mailto:removeCA@dbi.com) for our Canadian customers.
