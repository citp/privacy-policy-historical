**Accountability for Onward Transfer of Personal Data  
 **

This Policy and David Yurman’s _[Online Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/assistance/online-privacy-notice.html)_ describe David Yurman’s sharing of Consumer Personal Data.   
 

Except as permitted or required by applicable law, David Yurman provides Consumers with an opportunity to opt out of sharing their Personal Data with third-party Controllers.  David Yurman requires third-party Controllers to whom it discloses Consumer Personal Data to contractually agree to (i) only process the Personal Data for limited and specified purposes consistent with the consent provided by the relevant Consumer, (ii) provide the same level of protection for Personal Data as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles, and (iii) notify David Yurman and cease processing Personal Data (or take other reasonable and appropriate remedial steps) if the third-party Controller determines that it cannot meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection for Personal Data as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles. 

With respect to transfers of Consumer Personal Data to third-party Processors, David Yurman (i) enters into a contract with each relevant Processor, (ii) transfers Personal Data to each such Processor only for limited and specified purposes, (iii) ascertains that the Processor is obligated to provide the Personal Data with at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles, (iv) takes reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the Processor effectively processes the Personal Data in a manner consistent with David Yurman’s obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles, (v) requires the Processor to notify David Yurman if the Processor determines that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles, (vi) upon notice, including under (v) above, takes reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing of the Personal Data by the Processor, and (vii) provides a summary or representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of the Processor contract to the Department of Commerce, upon request.  David Yurman remains liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if the company’s third-party Processor onward transfer recipients process relevant Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless David Yurman proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.  
 

**Security  
 **

David Yurman takes reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Consumer Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data.

**Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation**

  
David Yurman limits the Consumer Personal Data it processes to that which is relevant for the purposes of the particular processing.  David Yurman does not process Consumer Personal Data in ways that are incompatible with the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized by the relevant Consumer.  In addition, to the extent necessary for these purposes, David Yurman takes reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data the company processes is (i) reliable for its intended use, and (ii) accurate, complete and current.  In this regard, David Yurman relies on its Consumers to update and correct the relevant Personal Data to the extent necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized.  Consumers may contact David Yurman as indicated below to request that David Yurman update or correct relevant Personal Data. 

Subject to applicable law, David Yurman retains Consumer Personal Data in a form that identifies or renders identifiable the relevant Consumer only for as long as it serves a purpose that is compatible with the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected or subsequently authorized by the Consumer.
