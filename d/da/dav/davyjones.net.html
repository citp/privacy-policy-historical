<h2>Information and Privacy Statement</h2>

<p><b>Web Hosting Logs</b>. As with most servers on the Internet, our servers automatically 
log visitor Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are used to help diagnose problems 
with servers and administer Web sites. These addresses are also used to gather broad demographic 
information, such as geographic regions and popular Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for 
the purpose of creating content and information that appeals to our customers.</p>

is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>

is not required to purchase, and PayPal accounts are initiated and maintained by PayPal 
members at the PayPal website, and are not subject to our access or control. When a customer 
places an order through our PayPal shopping cart, we receive notice of the purchase by 
email from PayPal containing the following personally identifying information which we 
use to communicate with and ship merchandise to customers:</p>

or trade this information with any third parties in any way.</p>
