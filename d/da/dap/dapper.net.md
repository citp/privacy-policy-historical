# Dapper Privacy Policy

Last Updated: Oct 13, 2010

**Privacy Policy**

On October 13th 2010, Dapper was acquired by Yahoo!. User information collected by Dapper continues to be subject to the Dapper Privacy Policy. In the future, you may be asked to link your current Dapper information to an existing or new Yahoo! ID. At that point, the [Yahoo! Privacy Policy](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/) will apply to all information associated with your Dapper account. 

DAPPER Inc., (in this policy: "we", "us", or "our") cares about your privacy. This policy explains the accepted privacy practices for our website at www.dapper.net ("Dapper").

This policy covers, among other things, what personal information we collect from you whether you are a registered user or not, how we use and disclose your personal information and the data obtained automatically when you use Dapper or its services, and how we retain it. Section I describes how we collect, use, and disclose data from users and visitors to Dapper.net.  Section II describes how we collect, use, and disclose information from users who simply view a Dapper Ad published on a third party web site.  Section III describes our data security and retention policy, and Section IV describes our commitment to children’s privacy.

If you have any questions or concerns about this policy or our information practices, please contact us at info@dapper.net.

We may change the terms of this Policy from time to time, in which case, we will post a notice on Dapper that the policy has been changed, and update the “last updated” date to reflect the date of the latest modifications. If you are a registered user, we will attempt to notify you using the email address you provided when you registered.  We recommend that you read this policy periodically to keep informed about our data collection, use, and disclosure practices.  We will not, without your consent, use information previously collected from you in a manner inconsistent with the terms of the policy in place when it was collected.

**I.          _YOUR USE OF DAPPER.NET_**

**_Personal Information we collect_**

When you register with Dapper we may ask you to provide personal details such as your name and e-mail address. You will also be asked to provide us with a username and password.

The fields for compulsory completion will be explicitly indicated. If you do not enter the requisite data in these fields, you will be unable to register with Dapper. 

We may collect further information when you use Dapper. For example, we may record the frequency and scope of your use of Dapper, the duration of your sessions, Dapps that you use or create, advertisement that you click on, the Internet protocol (IP) address that serves you to access Dapper and the geographic location from where you logged-in. We automatically gather this information, through the use of log files. If you are registered with Dapper, the information we gather may be anonymous or in some instances personally identifiable, and it may be associated with other personally identifiable information you have provided us. If you are not a registered user, yet accessed the site, we will not knowingly collect any information which may personally identify you.

Further information may be collected when we exchange communications with you, or when our designated copyright agent is in contact with you with respect to your content on Dapper.

**_Usernames and passwords to other websites_**

Some web pages have a login form. If you submit the form through Dapper, we will pass your username and password to the remote website, using the level of security that the remote website allows. Dapper will not store your username or password or share it with others. As a result, you will have to enter your username and password whenever you use the Dapp you are creating. However, in some instances we may have to store your username and password. For example, when you create an alert based on a Dapp we must periodically check the content related to your Dapp, without your intervention. In such cases, we will take measures to protect the information in order to minimize the risk of its exposure to unauthorized third parties.

**_How do we use your personal information?_**

We will use personally identifiable information for the following purposes:

  * To enable you to use Dapper, including the Dapps that you create, store, transmit or otherwise distribute when using Dapper; 


  * To post your Dapps on Dapper;


  * To allow you to access and use saved Dapps on Dapper and to adjust Dapper to your personal preferences; 


  * To facilitate the display of information and advertisements pertaining to products and services which might interest you; 


  * To provide you from time to time with information pertaining to Dapper;


  * To contact you as and when we believe it to be necessary;


  * Subject to your express consent at the time of registration with Dapper or later, to send you, from time to time, information pertaining to our services, as well as marketing and advertising material, whether ours or others'. You may withdraw your consent at any time and cease receiving material of this kind, by following the relevant procedure at Dapper. In any case, we will not share your personal details with any advertisers, without your explicit consent.


  * To any other purpose, as stipulated in this Policy, or in the Terms of Use governing the use of Dapper ("Terms of Use").



We may use anonymous information for the proper operation and function of Dapper, to improve the quality of Dapper and to enhance your experience, to create new services, including services tailored to users’ personal requirements and expectations, and to change or cancel existing features and content. We may share such information with others, provided that it does not identify you personally.

_Forms_ :  Certain Dapper Ads may contain mechanisms for you to submit information, such as through a form.  The information you provide in any such form is submitted directly to the third party advertiser, subject to that third party advertiser’s policies on information collection, use, and disclosure.  Dapper is not involved in any such form submission, and does not receive or collect any information submitted in this manner.

**_How do we use your information?_**

We use the information we collect from you through our advertising service for a variety of purposes.  Cookie information is used to better understand your browsing habits and interests, so that we can tailor ad content displayed to you when you browse any of the third party publishers’ web sites that display Dapper Ads.  We may use anonymous information, such as the information we collect through cookies and log files, for the proper operation and function of Dapper, to improve the quality of Dapper and to enhance your experience, to create new services, including services tailored to users’ personal requirements and expectations, and to change or cancel existing features and content.

You may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing your account preferences page on the Dapper website.  Please note that while your changes may be reflected promptly in active user databases, we may retain all information we collect for a variety of purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics. Information we collect may be stored in archival form for up to two years, after which it will be de-identified or removed.

**IV.        _OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN’S PRIVACY_**

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age, and no part of Dapper is not directed to persons under 13.  If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access DAPPER at any time or in any manner.  If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on Dapper without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.  If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a Dapper account, then you may alert us at info@dapper.net and request that we delete that child’s personal information from our systems.
