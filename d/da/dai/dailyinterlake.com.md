# Hagadone Corporation Privacy Policy

                                    Hagadone Corporation
                                          Privacy Policy
In the course of providing services to our clients and customers, we may obtain electronic
information of various types. We recognize that our customers’ information may be private and
confidential. It is our corporate practice and policy to safeguard and protect that information in
two primary ways:
    1. All information received from customers will be maintained in a secure environment, both
        physically and electronically. Hagadone Corporation has robust electronic security
        protocols in place that meet or exceed federal standards (such as HIPAA and NIST) for
        the protection of sensitive and confidential information. Those standards will be followed
        in the use and protection of customer information.
    2. Information received from customers will not be disclosed to any outside third parties
        without the customer’s written or electronic consent.​ Hagadone Corporation keeps
        customer personal and company information–such as name or e-mail address– private.
        It is our policy to use the customer information we acquire for internal business uses only
        and to enable us to provide products and services to the customer.
The only exceptions to the above are as follows:
    1. If it is necessary to share customer information in order to investigate, prevent, or take
        action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to
        the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.
    2. If Hagadone Corporation is acquired by or merged with another company, it may be
        necessary to transfer customer information to the successor company. In this event,
        Hagadone Corporation will notify you before information about you is transferred and
        becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
In the unlikely event that Hagadone experiences a security breach involving customer
information, we will carefully investigate the incident, notify the customer as soon as our
investigation is completed and take any corrective action needed to prevent further incidents.
