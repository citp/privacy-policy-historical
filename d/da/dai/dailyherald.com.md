## What infomation does DailyHerald.com Collect?

_Personally Identifiable Information:_ Personal data is collected when users voluntarily provide information to dailyherald.com, for example in registering for e-mail communications or other services, answering surveys, entering contests or sweepstakes, purchasing an archived photo, requesting vacation delivery stop, or posting an online ad. During these activities, dailyherald.com may request information such as your name, e-mail address, residence address, phone number, date of birth, subscriber status, and credit card number (when purchasing products or services). We may also ask you for other information at other times.

You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of certain of our web site's features. 

_Anonymous and Aggregated Information:_ Anonymous and aggregated information, such as which web pages users access, the number of daily visits to dailyherald.com, and anonymous responses to survey questions, is automatically collected through various methods. In the course of using dailyherald.com, we may also automatically track certain information about you. This information includes the URL that you just came from, the URL you go to next, and the Internet browser you are using. This statistical information is important to allow us to evaluate and improve the services we provide, to monitor the site's performance and to make it easier for visitors to use dailyherald.com.

_Use of Cookies:_ The dailyherald.com site also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most web sites write to your computer's hard drive or memory for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow Paddock to measure activity on the various areas of the dailyherald.com site and improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various parts of dailyherald.com without re-registering.

You may also get cookies from our advertisers in connection with serving advertisements. We do not have access to cookies set by third parties or the information that they may contain.

Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.

_Information That is Not Covered by this Policy:_ This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at dailyherald.com, and does not cover any information collected by any other web site or offline by Paddock, its affiliates or any other company.

Through dailyherald.com, you will be able to access information, advertisements, web sites, features, contests, sweepstakes, etc. offered by other parties (e.g., Accuweather, MSNBC). Such third party content and resources may be accessed through links to other web sites, pop-ups, frames within the dailyherald.com site, or other technological means. Paddock will always endeavor to identify the third party source of the content. Users should review the privacy policies of those third parties before providing personally identifiable information on a co-branded, affiliated, framed or linked site. Such third parties may send their own cookies to you, and may collect data and make uses of it that Paddock would not. We do not control these sites or uses, or bear any responsibility or liability for them.

Information that you choose to post on a message board, forum, or chat room is also not covered by this Privacy Policy, and is not considered a confidential communication. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information in a public area online - for example, in a Letter to the Editor or as a Guest Book entry in our Legacy.com obituary resource- that information can be collected and used by both Paddock and others. Paddock is not responsible for the disclosure or use of your name, e-mail address or other submitted information under these circumstances.

_Children Under 13:_ In general, Paddock does not knowingly collect any personal data on dailyherald.com from individuals under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, do not send any information about yourself to dailyherald.com, including your name, address or e-mail address. In the event dailyherald.com runs a contest or other program that requires submission of information from children, we will collect such information only with prior verified parental consent. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible. Paddock encourages all parents to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of the Internet.
