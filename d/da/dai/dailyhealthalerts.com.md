Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as
enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of
information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.
Our Company "Ringold Nutritional Systems, LLC" has created this Privacy Policy to
demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes
how our Company, "Ringold Nutritional Systems, LLC" collects information from all
end users of our Internet services (the "Services")-those who access some of our Services
but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or
pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what we do with the
information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the
collection and use of such information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy
carefully. By visiting our Company, "Ringold Nutritional Systems, LLC" Web site, you
are consenting to our policy of collecting and using your data.
Personal Information Our Company, "Ringold Nutritional Systems, LLC" Collects
and How It Is Used
Introduction. Our Company, "Ringold Nutritional Systems, LLC" collects information in
different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services
and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service.
Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they
sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing
information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used
to access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the
registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing
purposes). This information may be shared with third parties, as stated herein, or in
special circumstances.
 However, in instances where our Company, "Ringold Nutritional Systems, LLC" and a
partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal
information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the
Services as a result of the joint promotion for the purpose of offering you other products
and services.
We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information
Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of
Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-
identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.
Our Company, "Ringold Nutritional Systems, LLC" collects personal information
through forms you complete on the site, as well as but not limited to contests,
sweepstakes, text messages, e-mails, faxes, telephone calls, postal mail or other


communications with the user, as well as from outside sources such as credit card
processors and database vendors.
For example, when you fill out a form subscribing to our emails, we are sent data
information from our autoresponder company such as your name, email, the website you
signed up from, geographical data such as your city, state, Postal code, country, Latitude,
Longitude, Timestamp, Subscription method and IP address.
Also, with purchases, we supply our member's contact information, to our business
partners, who then may contact the member by telephone after the member purchase.
Sales proceeds are collected by the that business partner company. We also may supply
other companies with contact information, for mail offers we believe would be of interest
to our members, with or without compensation from those companies. At times we may
send an advertisement for a third party product, where we collect the sales proceeds, and
forward the purchaser's information to that third party.
Our Company, "Ringold Nutritional Systems, LLC" Partners and Sponsors: Some
products and services may be offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an
affiliate, independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and
Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and
maintain personal information.
Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register
to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and service updates. In
many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name,
address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information.
If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a
recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the
recipient's name, address, and phone number. Our Company, "Ringold Nutritional
Systems, LLC" has no control over the third parties' use of any personal information you
provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.

Systems, LLC", we use the personal information you provide to process that order. We
do share this information with outside parties that we do business with.
Online Advertisements: Our Company, "Ringold Nutritional Systems, LLC" may display
our online advertisements. In those cases we share information about our Visitors and
Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and
promotions with these advertisers.
Additionally, in some instances, we use this information to deliver tailored
advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company
tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the
audience. Based upon the information we have collected, we may then display or send the


advertisement to the intended audience. Our Company, "Ringold Nutritional Systems,
LLC" does share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these
advertisers or joint venture companies.
