When accessing our Website, Daily Inspiration (DI) will learn certain information about you during your visit. How DI will handle information we learn about you depends upon what you do when visiting DI’s site.

##### General

If you visit DI’s site to read or download information on the pages, DI collect and store only the information about you which is available via Google Analytics. If you identify yourself by sending DI an e-mail containing personal information, then the information collected will be solely used to respond to your message. The information collected is for statistical purposes. DI may use software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, DI uses software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. DI will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to DI, nor will such information be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval of the user at the time of collection.

##### Facebook App

On DI it is possible to connect with your Facebook account to our Application. The only permission we ask is the ability to publish to your timeline when you save a post. This is needed to make the posts available in your personal DI facebook app page. You can customize via your Facebook Privacy settings who can view the posts via our app.
