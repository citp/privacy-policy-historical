"We" or "Our" or "Us" means DAILY FINANCE GROUP. "Our Website" also means DAILY FINANCE GROUP.

All information transmitted, printed or otherwise submitted to DAILY FINANCE GROUP through this Website remains your property; however, DAILY FINANCE GROUP will be free to use that information for any lawful purpose as detailed below.

This Website contains links to other websites. DAILY FINANCE GROUP is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.

#### Section 1

  3. Information (user-specific or aggregate) concerning the pages our visitors access and referring URLs; and

**Please note: We may also collect your personally identifiable information when you submit information at the Website but do not complete the full registration process.**

#### Section 2

Use of Data Collected

We use the information we collect to enhance your experience at our Website and to help us to offer content we determine may be of interest to you. We use your contact information to offer you promotional material from our partners. We may also use your personal, demographic, and profile data to improve our Website, conduct statistical analysis, and for marketing, promotional, editorial, or feedback purposes. Information collected by us may be added to our databases and used for future e-mails or postal mailings of products and services.

#### Section 3

Disclosure of Data to Third Parties

By using this Website, you agree that you may be contacted in any manner contemplated in this section even if your phone number is included in a state, national, or federal do not call list. If you choose to provide personal information, it will be used for and/or shared with trusted third parties such as Affiliated Loan Providers and/or other financial service providers, credit bureaus, and for marketing products and services that you might find of interest. We reserve the right to share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose your information with/to third parties in accordance with applicable laws. These third-party businesses may include, but are not limited to: providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; e-mail marketers; and telemarketers.

The information we collect may be added to our databases and used for future telemarketing via telephone calls, including telephone calls that may use an auto-dialer system, SMS text-messaging, instant messaging, e-mails or postal mailings regarding site updates, new products and services, upcoming events, and/or status of orders and/or loans placed online.

We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples may include sending direct mail and e-mail, removing duplicate information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis. These agents have access to our users' personal information as needed to perform their functions for DAILY FINANCE GROUP, but we do not permit them to use our users' personal information for other purposes.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you authorize us to use your information to obtain other information about you (for example, your Social Security Number) from third-parties when the information was incompletely or improperly filled out on our registration form. Third-parties include, but are not limited to, consumer reporting agencies, consumer credit bureaus and other outside parties, as permitted or required by applicable laws. Any and all Sensitive Information provided by you on this Site or on any third-parties Site, will be used to determine your eligibility for a loan or other products, offers or services, should you qualify. If you choose to provide information, such as your Social Security Number, we may use that information to determine your financial status. If you do not provide such information, we may also use other information that you provided for the purpose of verifying your eligibility for a loan or for any other programs, offer, or services. Upon qualification, your ultimate loan-specific financial information will be stored and utilized by your applicable lender in accordance with the terms of that lender's Privacy Policy.

Information Collection Processes

DAILY FINANCE GROUP may employ "cookies" to help customize your access to the Website. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. Cookies have many benefits to enhance your experience at our Website. For instance, by setting a cookie on our Website, a user would not need to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Website. Even in the case where a user rejects a cookie, they may still use our Website. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in what he/she can access in some areas on our Website, much like visitor-level access.

We may occasionally use cookies to anonymously track and target the interests of our users to further enhance the experience on our Website. We may also use cookies for advertising tracking purposes. To find out more about cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.

In addition to cookies, our Website pages and/or e-mails may contain electronic images known as pixel tags (also known as clear gifs) to track the pages that visitors and/or users visit at the Website for purposes of formatting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. Pixel tags from third parties may also be present on our Website to help determine the effectiveness of a joint promotional or advertising campaign.

#### Section 5

Use of Cookies

DAILY FINANCE GROUP and its affiliated web properties uses cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to enhance and personalize your online experience and to enable DAILY FINANCE GROUP to recognize you as a previous visitor to the DAILY FINANCE GROUP web properties. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. Cookies record information about your online preferences. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

DAILY FINANCE GROUP may also allow its partners and advertisers that are presenting advertisements on its web properties to set their cookies, or apply web beacons or similar technologies, to your computer. This information may be used to:

  1. remember the preferences and registration data that you give us;
  2. authenticate your Screen Name before you can access your Personal Information or Web Services Account for added security
  3. enable you to participate in certain online activities, such as making sure that each person only votes in an online poll once;
  4. personalize features of the DAILY FINANCE GROUP web pages, for example by providing you with customized content or advertisements based on the information you have submitted to us and your activity when using the DAILY FINANCE GROUP websites;
  5. help measure and research the effectiveness of the DAILY FINANCE GROUP web properties, including collecting statistics on your response to advertisements, e-mail and other communications you receive;
  6. provide security within shopping baskets or transactions.



DAILY FINANCE GROUP and its associated third parties may also use ad network providers to help present advertisements on DAILY FINANCE GROUP websites and other online properties. These ad network providers may use cookies, or web beacons or similar technologies on your computer to tailor content, advertisements to your preferences, help target, measure and track your visits and the effectiveness of advertisements and promotions, using data gathered over time and across their networks of Web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience and to provide security within shopping baskets or transactions.

The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.

You can adjust the settings on your browser to erase or block such technologies from your computer if you want to, but if you do so, you will not be able to use or access the DAILY FINANCE GROUP web pages provided.

Information for ISPs

DAILY FINANCE GROUP understands consumers' concerns over the use of their personal information. We hope this information will relieve any concerns that your company may have regarding our e-mail policies.

DAILY FINANCE GROUP and its affiliated sites use only an "opt-in" or "opt out" method of obtaining customer information, and it is not our policy to send unsolicited e-mail. We obtain e-mail addresses and personal information from third parties that follow the same set of policies.

DAILY FINANCE GROUP e-mail messages sent include information about the origin of the e-mails and include instructions on how recipients can unsubscribe from receiving future e-mail message.

From time to time, DAILY FINANCE GROUP will enter into an arrangement with a third-party website to allow individuals to opt into our marketing program on those third-party websites. In each case, the third-party websites have represented and warranted to us, among other things, that the data was collected voluntarily from individuals on website registrations and co-registrations, that the sellers have a right, under any applicable privacy policies, to transfer the data to us, and that DAILY FINANCE GROUP has the right to send marketing offers to the individuals. We hope this information satisfies any questions or concerns you may have regarding the e-mail practices of DAILY FINANCE GROUP. If you have additional questions or wish to discuss this matter further, please visit our contact us page.
