### **Information We Collect and How We Use It**

#### **Personal Information**

We collect information that you choose to provide us or that you choose to include in your profile or account, and that personally identifies you such as your name, address, zip code, telephone number, e-mail address, and other personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”). You may be asked to provide us with Personal Information when you register with the Website and at other times to enable us to provide the Website and Services to you and to manage our relationship with you including payment processing, troubleshooting and maintenance. As authorized by you (opt-in consent) or permitted by law, your Personal Information may also be used by us to market (directly or indirectly by third parties) products and services that may be of interest to you. The decision to provide this information is optional. However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Website or Services. The lawful bases for processing your Personal Information in this manner include DW’s legitimate interest, compliance with legal obligations, and the performance of any contractual relationship requested by you.

#### **Usage Data and Site Activity  **

We automatically collect and analyze information in connection with the actions you take on the Website and in connection with using the Services (“Usage Data”) to improve the Website, Services and User experience. This data includes, but is not limited to, the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, your IP address, aggregate data about the number of visits to the Website, and aggregate data about the pages visited. This anonymous usage information may be associated with your username and profile, but we do not disclose this information to third parties. The lawful bases for processing your Personal Information in this manner include DW’s legitimate interest, compliance with legal obligations, and the performance of a contractual relationship with you.

#### **Cookies and Online Tracking Technologies  **

DW may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser) and other third party tracking technologies such as web beacons (an electronic file placed on a website that monitors usage), to collect general and personally identifiable information about visitors to the Website. The information collected is used to improve the experience of the Website and Services, such as allowing us to recognize you when you revisit the Website to provide you with customized information and/or to remember your preferences. We use cookies and other third party tracking technologies such as web beacons to collect Personal Information. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Website or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. 

#### **Advertising  **

Notwithstanding any other provision, we partner with third parties (Third Party Providers and Advertisers, collectively known as “Advertisers” as such terms are defined below) that collect information across various channels, including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more relevant advertising to you. Our partners may place or recognize a cookie on your computer, device or directly in our emails/communications, and we may share personal information with them, as permitted by law and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Our partners may link the personal information we share with them to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information. Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. For example, our partners may deliver an ad to you in your web browser based on a purchase you made in a physical retail store, or they may send a personalized marketing email to you based on the fact that you visited a particular website. To learn more about interest-based advertising in general and to opt out, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an ad network may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown via the Site, the Services or on third-party websites. You can visit the Network Advertising Initiative website at [www.networkadvertising.org](https://www.networkadvertising.org/), which offers information about Internet advertising companies and how to opt out of their information collection.

#### **Do Not Track Disclosure  **

Additionally, although some Internet browsers have a ‘do not track’ feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, we are currently not set up to respond to such signals.

#### **Sharing Your Information**

DW does not sell, trade, or disclose your Personal Information to third parties except as set forth in this Privacy Policy and as follows: 

  * To contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them. 
  * To DW corporate affiliated entities. 
  * To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, change in control, or other sale, transfer, or other action with respect to of some or all of DW assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by DW about the Website users is among the assets affected.
  * If we were previously authorized or are otherwise permitted by law to share your Personal Information with our affiliates and Advertising Partners to provide you with information that may be relevant to you, including for their own marketing purposes.
  * To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. 
  * To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.

  * We may disclose aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about the Website users without restriction. 



#### **Retention of Personal Information**

We retain your Personal Information for as long as we have a relationship with you. We also retain your Personal Information for a period of time after our relationship with you has ended where there is an ongoing business need to retain it. This includes retention to comply with our legal, regulatory, tax and/or accounting obligations. We do so in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable law.
