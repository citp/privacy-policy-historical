<p><font face="Verdana" size="4">PRIVACY COMMITMENT</font></p>
<p><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Overview</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">College Publisher, the operator of this site and 
custodian of the information gathered herein, in conjunction with our affiliated 
Media Partners and Sponsors, commits to ensuring that no information will be 
provided to others in any form that will personally identify you, unless you 
have authorized us to do so.&nbsp; Neither College Publisher nor our Media 
Partners will sell, share, or rent any personally identifiable information 
collected from you with other third parties unless you have authorized us to do 
so.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">College Publisher, on behalf of our affiliated 
Media Partners &amp; Sponsors may ask visitors for information that will help us 
improve our ability to present meaningful, tailored news, information, services 
and products to each reader, member, subscriber or registered user. We regard 
the privacy and security of such information as a critical component of the 
services that we offer. The following explains the information gathering and 
dissemination practices used at our Web sites.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The more information you, the reader, member, 
subscriber or registered user provides regarding your name, contact details, 
interests, concerns and personal details, the more effective our sites can be at 
offering news, information, products, services and/or advice that meet your 
needs. Any personal information you share through this site will be used solely 
to provide an efficient, focused experience, and to deliver information and 
services that are appropriate for your unique situation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Information Collection and 
Use</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">College Publisher is the operator and custodian of 
the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this 
information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this 
statement. Our sites collect information from users at several different points 
on our website.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Registration</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">College Publisher operates and provides email and 
database services that enable users to receive information, news, content and 
services that they are interested in receiving.&nbsp; Our registration forms may 
require you to give us your name, email address, college or university name, and 
affiliation and/or class year and/or certain contact or demographic information 
("Registration Data"). We use Registration Data if it is necessary for us to 
contact a user, and to send you information, service enhancements, complementary 
goods and services, and/or promotional materials that you have agreed to receive 
from our media Partners, Advertisers, &amp; Sponsors ("Partners, Advertisers 
&amp; Sponsors"). If you choose to stop receiving future communications, please 
see the Opt-Out/Unsubscribe section below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Contests, Surveys &amp; 
Referrals</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From time to time, we run contests and surveys on 
our site in which we may ask contestants for personal information and/or 
referrals. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary 
and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 
Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping 
address), demographic information (such as zip code, age level) and preference 
information (interest in travel, money, etc). Contact information will be used 
to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for 
purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. If a 
user elects to use our referral service for informing a referee about our site 
or services, we may ask them for certain contact details for the referee. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Online Actions</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Demographic and profile data may also be collected 
from time to time at our Web site. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Generally, this information is collected through 
"traffic data" and may entail the use of cookies, IP addresses or other numeric 
codes used to identify a computer. We use this information to further tailor 
your experience at our site, and to narrow the information, content, products 
and or services we think you might be interested in.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">· IP Addresses - We use your IP address to help 
diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP 
address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic 
information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">· Cookies - Cookies are pieces of information that 
a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. 
Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do 
identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept 
cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to notify you each time a 
cookie is received or to refuse all cookies. However, you may not be able to 
take full advantage of our Web sites if you do so. For example, we use cookies 
to save your password so that (if you choose) you do not have to reenter it each 
time you visit our Web sites. Some of our business partners use cookies on our 
site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over 
these cookies.</font></p>
<p><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Classifieds, Orders and other ecommerce 
transactions</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For ecommerce transactions we request information 
from the user as per the ordering process. During this process a user must 
provide relevant contact information (like name and shipping address) and 
financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This 
information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill user requirements. If we 
have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in 
touch with the user.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Sharing of Information</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We will only disclose personal data about you to 
the extent described in this Privacy Statement. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No personally identifiable information will be 
shared with our Partners, Advertisers &amp; Sponsors unless you have agreed to 
allow us to share such information (although you may separately provide them 
such information). Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis 
only, as a part of a larger set of statistics (for example, that a certain 
percentage of our members are male), but that information will not be sufficient 
to permit the recipient to identify you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Should you at some time request through our site 
something that requires shipping to you, we may be required to provide your 
personal details to outside shipping companies, credit card processing companies 
and other third parties to enable your request to be processed. These companies, 
to our knowledge, do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable 
information for any secondary purposes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We sometimes contract with other companies to 
provide specific services on our behalf. When the user signs up for these 
services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary 
for the third party service provider to deliver these services. These parties 
are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the 
purpose of providing these services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As we continue to develop our services, we might 
sell or buy companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information 
generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event 
that we or substantially all of our assets are acquired, customer information 
will of course be one of the transferred assets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Except as set forth in the Terms of Service and 
this Privacy Statement, we will not willfully disclose personal data about you 
to any third party without first receiving your permission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Security</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Information collected by us is stored in secure 
operating environments that are not accessible by the public. Our Web sites have 
security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of 
the information under our control. When capturing credit card information, we 
use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, an encryption technology that works 
with Netscape Navigator and Communicator (versions 2.0 and above), Microsoft 
Internet Explorer (versions 3.0 and above) and AOL (AOL 3.0 and above) so that 
unauthorized parties cannot read the information you send over the 
Internet.&nbsp; Credit card information is not stored on our servers, it is 
simply passed through to the processing financial institution via 
SSL.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Other Web Sites and 
Links</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We sometimes provide links to other Web sites. We 
are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other Web 
sites.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Additionally, if you make a purchase from a 
merchant listed on or linked to the our service, any information that you give, 
such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to those 
merchants. These merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices 
and we assume no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. We 
encourage our users to be aware when they leave our sites and to read the 
privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally 
identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information 
collected by us</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Public Forums</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our services may enable members to make certain 
information publicly available on the Web sites. Be advised that any information 
that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should 
exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Corrections and Updates</strong> 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Members may correct, update or edit information 
that they have previously provided by sending an email to </font><a href="mailto:feedback@collegepublisher.com"><font face="Verdana" size="2">feedback@collegepublisher.com</font></a><font face="Verdana" size="2"> (or 
written mail to the address below), including your name, email address and the 
information to be changed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Opt-Out/Unsubscribe</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our Web site provides users the opportunity to 
opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request 
information about the visitor. You may elect to avoid future communications from 
us by sending an email to </font><a href="mailto:feedback@collegepublisher.com"><font face="Verdana" size="2">feedback@collegepublisher.com</font></a><font face="Verdana" size="2"> (or 
written mail to the address below), including your name, email address, and 
specifics of your request. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition, every email that is sent to your 
account will contain instructions and links to allow you to unsubscribe from the 
specific service.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After you opt-out, we may still need to send you 
information about the service or your account under urgent circumstances, but we 
will not send you unsolicited communications.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Notification of 
Changes</strong></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong></strong>
<p><br>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on 
our websites so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how 
we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we 
decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from 
that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an 
email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in 
this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy 
policy under which the information was collected. <br></p>
