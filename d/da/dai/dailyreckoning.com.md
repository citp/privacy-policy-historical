PRIVACY POLICY - IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ  
We at The Daily Reckoning take your privacy very seriously.

e-Mail Address  
When you subscribe to The Daily Reckoning via e-mail, your e-mail address is placed in a database and used to send your issues of The Daily Reckoning and occasional Daily Reckoning Investment Alerts. We will not sell, rent, or otherwise share your e-mail address with anyone.

 You can remove your address from our e-mailing list by following the instructions at the end of every e-mail we send, or by visiting our Reader Services page.

Any e-mail you send to The Daily Reckoning is considered confidential unless you tell us otherwise. We will not add your name to our e-mail list without your permission. If your inquiry is about an order or subscription, Agora's customer service staff will ask you to verify your identity by confirming information already in your record.

Spam  
If you believe that The Daily Reckoning has sent you unsolicited commercial e-mail (spam), please send an e-mail to [ abuse@dailyreckoning.com](mailto:abuse@dailyreckoning.com?subject=).

Personal Information  
We will never ask you for personal information--your credit card number, for example--except when you place an order. At that time, we will provide a secure (SSL, encrypted) connection and require you to submit only the information needed to complete and fulfill your order. Only authorized employees of Agora, Inc. (our parent company) will have access to this information. Agora will not sell or rent this information to anyone, nor share it in any other way, unless required to by a law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it. Please note that "personal information" does not include your mailing address. See Mailing Address, below.

Cookies  
Cookies are small files placed on your computer by a web page when you visit it. They can be used to store all sorts of useful information to make your next visit easier and more convenient, but some people are uncomfortable not knowing what information is in a cookie.

The Daily Reckoning web site uses cookies only to compile statistics on the use of the various pages on our site (how many people visit each page and that sort of thing). We do not store or collect any personally identifiable information.

Discussion Board  
If you choose to participate on The Daily Reckoning's Discussion Board, you do so at your own risk.

You must submit a name to post a message to the Discussion Board, but it doesn't have to be your real name. Using your real name or e-mail address when you post is entirely voluntary. In fact, it's just not a good idea. Agora does not collect e-mail addresses from the Discussion Board, but there is nothing to prevent an unscrupulous person or company from doing so and then using that address to send you unwanted e-mail (spam).

Aliases are completely acceptable--but only as long as they are unique and not meant to impersonate another person (for example, "Bill Bonner" is not acceptable). If you feel that someone is impersonating you on our Discussion Board, please contact  [ dr@dailyreckoning.com](mailto:dr@dailyreckoning.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy "Privacy Policy"). We will take whatever steps we deem necessary, possibly including legal action, to correct the matter.

We reserve the right to remove any messages from the board for any reason whatsoever. We prohibit or strongly discourage: advertisements to buy or sell securities, promotions and advertisements of any type and links thereto, impersonating another person, unnecessary profanity, ludicrous and thoroughly discredited conspiracy theories, and personal attacks. However, we cannot be held responsible for any claims made on our Discussion Board.

Enjoy the ride!
