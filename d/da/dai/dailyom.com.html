DailyOM will not share your personal information with any third party without your express consent.  We also request additional demographic information (gender, birthdate), which is optional.  We use this information to create a better user experience and evaluate which DailyOMs should be featured.  Additionally, we may share this demographic information (including country and zip code) with others including potential advertisers in an anonymous report.  This demographic information will presented in a purely anonymous, aggregated manner that has no personal information attached to it.  All information provided in the <i>Email This To A Friend</i> utility is used solely for purposes of generating one-time private emails that are sent under your email address to those parties you have designated, and no information will be stored or shared with any third party.

<p>
<b>Sale of Our Company</b><br>
As a natural consequence of the development of our company, we could be sold to another company. In the event that we are acquired by another company or a significant portion of our assets is sold to another company, all of the customer information may be transferred to the new company.
