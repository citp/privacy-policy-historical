# Privacy Policy | www.dailyrx.com

**dailyRx** knows your personal privacy is very important, and we intend to earn your trust each and every day you access **dailyRx.com**. Our privacy policy applies to all **dailyRx** services, but it does not apply to third-party companies or for advertising relationships. Each of these companies has its own privacy policies, and we strongly encourage you to review the policies of each and every Web site you visit, are directed to or register for.

**dailyRx.com** contains links to other Web sites. Once you enter another Web site (whether through an advertisement, service or content link), please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that external Web site and that our privacy terms do not apply.

Our privacy policy informs you specifically what information is collected, how that information is used and other related subjects about your use of our Web site. To keep current with new technologies or regulations, we may change our privacy policy from time to time at our discretion. However, if we make a change, we may post version dates with a notice banner on the Web site, in our e-newsletters or via e-mail notification.

**How We Protect Your Information**

To prevent unauthorized access to information, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct usage, we have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and workflow procedures designed to safeguard the information we collect. We limit access to your personal information to those individuals, companies and partners who have a clear need to know that information in order to support our businesses, products or services.

The following types of personally identifiable information may be collected and stored by the Web site and used by **dailyRx** :

  * E-mail address--As part of registering for the **dailyRx** e-newsletter, for any other **dailyRx** application (individually and collectively called "eNewsletters") or for use of our sites, you will be asked to provide your e-mail address. Your e-mail address will be used to deliver newsletters and other services.

  * Demographic information--As part of registering for eNewsletters or for use of our sites, we may ask you for specific demographic information so we may deliver information that is more relevant to you and your interests. For example, we may ask you about your gender, race, age, areas of interest and other information that would help us deliver services targeted to you. **dailyRx** may also combine information that we have about you with information we obtain from business partners or other parties.
