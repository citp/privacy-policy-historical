Content that you create through or upload to the Website will by default be public and available to users of the Website and the Services. Similarly, if you comment on any Content (as defined in the [Terms of Use](https://daily.social/terms-of-use/)) on the Website or the Services, your comments will be public and available to users of the Website and the Services.

We may share data about our users or the use of the Website or Services with our advertisers and partners. This means that we may tell our advertisers general information about the characteristics of our user base, but we do not specifically identify a particular user or visitor by name or provide the user’s contact information. We may share your unique device ID and/or your location (based on opt-in location-based services, which rely upon a device’s GPS coordinates) with third parties, including advertisers and partners, or provide reports to such parties about the number of unique users who saw or clicked on their advertisements. We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information, among other things, allows third-party ad networks to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.

Information will be shared with such service providers only to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform such services.

Regardless of any choices you make regarding any personally identifiable data you provide, we may preserve and disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in connection with any legal investigation, or by law or regulation, including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or request.

Regardless of any choices you make regarding any personally identifiable

data/information you provide, we may preserve and disclose your information

if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary to protect the safety

of any person, to address fraud, security or technical issues, to protect

Bigtree’s rights or property, and/or to investigate or assist in preventing any

violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our Terms of

Use.

We may share some or all of your information in connection with, or during

negotiation of, any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or

proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion

of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or

receivership, your information may also be transferred as a business asset. If

obligations regarding your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

(i) Creation Of Anonymous And Aggregated Data

We may create Anonymous Data (i.e., your personal information/data that has

been anonymized by or for Bigtree so that it does not allow a third party to

easily identify a specific individual) and/or Aggregated Data (i.e., your

information/data that has been combined by or for Bigtree into anonymous

groups of users where the groups are large enough to reasonably prevent

individual users from being identified) records from the information/data you

provide by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data

personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous and Aggregated Data

to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of

our Services and improve Website navigation. We reserve the right, in our

sole discretion, to use Anonymous and/or Aggregated Data for any purpose

and to disclose Anonymous and/or Aggregated Data to third parties for any

purpose.

secure or error-free. In particular, messages sent to or from this Website may

not be secure. Please notify us as soon as possible if you suspect that there

is any breach of security.

4\. ADVERTISING

Bigtree displays targeted advertisements. When an advertiser books an ad

placement on the Website, they are given the opportunity to choose their

audience by location, demographics, gender and any other non-personally

identifiable information we receive or collect from you.

By interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that

the advertiser may make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria

used to display the ad. Please note that this Privacy Policy in no way restricts

or limits our collection and use of aggregate information which is data we

collect about your use of our Website or about a group or category of services

or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifiable

information has been removed.

Advertisers may sometimes place their own cookies on your computer in

order to make their ads more effective.

Please remember that any personal information you provide on the linked

pages, ads you click on or other websites is subject to a third party’s privacy

policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked websites, ads you

click on or other website, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy

and security practices and policies of these websites or any other websites

that are linked to from our website. We encourage you to learn about their

privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with

personal information.

Also, third party ad networks may serve ads on our Website or provide ads via

our services and/or otherwise place cookies, web beacons or other devices or

technologies on our Platforms (or via our Services) to enable them to

automatically collect non-personal information about you and your visits to our

Website and to other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser

you use to visit our Website and other websites. Information collected may be

used, among other things, to analyze data, to deliver content and advertising

on our Website or other websites (including content and advertising that is

targeted to your interests), to determine the popularity of certain content, and

to better understand the usage and visitation of our Website and the other

websites tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Policy does not apply to,

and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear GIFs in third party ads, and

technical issues; or to protect our rights and property.
