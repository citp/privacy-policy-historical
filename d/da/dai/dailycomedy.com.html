				<h2>Daily Comedy Privacy Policy</h2><br>
				<br>
				Not Kidding<br>
				<br>
				<b>DailyComedy.com Member/Fan Value Proposition</b><br>
				DailyComedy.com is a website on which several of America's funniest
				comedians post topical jokes in text and on video every day in their
				own, unique, funny, and often twisted style.<br>
				<br>
				We created DailyComedy.com to make it easy to share jokes and
				information with your friends and other fans of comedy. We give you
				control of your information--you tell people only what you want them to
				know about you in your profile on your comedy stage. Also,
				DailyComedy.com believes you should have access only to the information
				others want to share.<br>
				<br>
				<b>DailyComedy.com Privacy Policy</b><br>
				DailyComedy.com's privacy policy is designed to help you understand how
				we collect and use the personal information you decide to share, and to
				help you make informed decisions when using DailyComedy.com.<br>
				<br>
				By using or accessing DailyComedy.com, you are accepting the practices
				described in this privacy policy. Information We Gather when you visit
				DailyComedy.com, you provide us with two types of information: personal
				information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and
				website use information collected by us as you interact with
				DailyComedy.com.<br>
				<br>
				When you register with DailyComedy.com, you provide us with certain
				personal information, such as your name, your email address, your zip
				code, your gender, your birth date, and some preference information.<br>
				<br>
				When you enter DailyComedy.com, we collect your browser type and IP
				address. This information is gathered for all DailyComedy.com visitors.
				In addition, we store certain information from your browser using
				cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer tied to
				information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that
				users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the
				browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login
				ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you
				come back to DailyComedy.com. You can remove or block this cookie using
				the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience
				feature.<br>
				<br>
				When you use DailyComedy.com, you may perform searches, set up a comedy
				stage, visit other comedy stages, interact with advertising, and
				transmit information by means of various types of functionality. We
				collect this information so that we can provide you DailyComedy.com's
				services and offer personalized features. When you update information,
				we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable
				period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that
				information, if necessary.<br>
				<br>
				By using DailyComedy.com, you are consenting to have your personal data
				transferred to and processed worldwide.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How DailyComedy.com Uses Information It Collects</b><br>
				When you register with DailyComedy.com, you create your own profile,
				privacy settings, and comment preferences. Your profile information
				(which you control), as well as your name and photo, are displayed on
				your comedy stage to enable other people to connect with you, and you
				choose other people who you want to be a fan of. We may occasionally use
				your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new
				services offered by DailyComedy.com, its subsidiaries and affiliates,
				which we think you may find valuable.<br>
				<br>
				Profile information you submit to DailyComedy.com will be available to
				visitors to your comedy stage. Your name, your comedy stage name, and
				profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results on
				DailyComedy.com.<br>
				<br>
				DailyComedy.com may use information in your profile without identifying
				you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as
				aggregating how many people like another fan or a comedian and to
				personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide
				relevant information to you.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Sharing Information With Third Parties</b><br>
				We do not provide contact information to third parties without your
				permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited
				circumstances where we believe such sharing is reasonably necessary to
				offer the service, legally required or permitted by you. For example:
				<br>
				<ul type="square">
				<li> We may provide information to service providers to help us bring
				      you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties
				      to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a
				      co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about
				      DailyComedy.com, to remove repetitive information from our user
				      lists, to process payments for products or services, or to provide
				      search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection
				      with these offerings and business operations, our service
				      providers may have access to your personal information for use for
				      a limited time in connection with these business activities. If we
				      use third parties for the processing of any personal information,
				      we will make reasonable efforts to implement contractual and
				      technical protections limiting the use of that information to
				      DailyComedy.com specified purposes.</li>
				<li> We will not sell your email address to third parties or the
				      DailyComedy.com list of email addresses to third parties.</li>
				<li> We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful
				      requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with
				      applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good
				      faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or
				      private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally,
				      we may share account or other information when we believe it is
				      necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or
				      property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated
				      through the DailyComedy.com service or using the DailyComedy.com
				      name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing
				      information with other companies, lawyers, agents, or government
				      agencies.</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Third Party Advertising</b><br>
				Ads that appear on DailyComedy.com can be served directly to
				members/fans by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your
				IP address in such cases. These third party advertisers may also
				download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as
				JavaScript and web beacons (also known as 1x1 gifs) to measure the
				effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Using
				these techniques allows the advertising network to recognize your
				computer each time they send you an ad in order to measure the
				effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In
				this way, they may compile information about where you or individuals
				using your computer saw their advertisements and determine which
				advertisements are clicked on. DailyComedy.com does not have access to
				or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party
				advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact
				information stored on DailyComedy.com unless you choose to share it with
				them.<br>
				<br>
				This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by DailyComedy.com and
				does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any
				of its advertisers.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Changing Or Removing Information</b><br>
				Access and control over personal information on DailyComedy.com is
				available through the comedy stage profile editing tools.
				DailyComedy.com users may modify or remove any of their profile
				information at any time by logging onto their account. Information will
				be updated immediately when changed. Individuals who wish to deactivate
				their DailyComedy.com account may do so. Removed information may persist
				in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be
				generally available to members of DailyComedy.com. You can also remove
				fans and comedians from your comedy stage by using the editing tools.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Security</b><br>
				DailyComedy.com takes all commercially reasonable precautions to protect
				our member/fans' information. Your account information is located on a
				secured server behind a firewall. Because email and instant messaging
				are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you NOT
				send private information to us by email or instant messaging services.
				If you have any questions about the security of DailyComedy.com, please
				contact us at <a href="mailto:editor@dailycomedy.com">editor@dailycomedy.com</a>.
