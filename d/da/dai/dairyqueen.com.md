Please read this privacy statement carefully, because by using our website, you accept and agree to the terms stated below. We may change the terms of this privacy statement at any time, and your continued use of this site is your agreement to any change in terms.

## Collection & Use of Information.

We collect information through our website in a couple different ways.

**Information You Submit**. You give us personal information when you join one of our loyalty clubs, enter one of our surveys, contests or sweepstakes, if you submit a question, comment or complaint, if you request or submit information about becoming a franchisee, if you submit an employment application, or for an online cake order. “Personal information” means any information about an identifiable individual, such as name, address, phone number, email, birth date, gender or zip code/postal code. Except with your consent or as required or permitted by law, we will use the information you submit for the purposes for which it is submitted or as otherwise described in this privacy statement. If you join one of our loyalty clubs, you may receive newsletters, email or special offers, which you may unsubscribe from at any time using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.

Most of our locations are independently owned and operated franchises, and we do not own or operate these locations. Comments, questions or complaints submitted to us about a specific location will be forwarded to the franchised location, along with any contact information you provide with your comment. If you have comments regarding a specific location, we recommend you contact that location directly so that they may personally and immediately assist you. We do not guarantee the privacy practices of any specific franchised location.
