Please note that the links to our third party service providers’ privacy policies and the information contained within them may change from time to time. If the links provided do not allow you to access the privacy policies, please notify us by contacting us using the information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

We have contracts with these third party service providers, and they are subject to the legal requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate.

We will protect your information as described in this Privacy Policy if your personal information is transferred to these third parties and by us to other countries, but we do not control these third parties, including their tracking technologies and their use of the data that you provide to them directly or through the Website and the Services. We have provided links to these third party services providers’ privacy policies. While we will respond to any requests about your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, please note that we may not be able to have these third parties fulfill requests with respect to your personal information. For instance, if you ask us to delete your personal information, we will delete the personal information that we possess about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, but our third party service providers may have separate data retention policies. For instance, our hosting provider may have backup tapes of your personal information that it retains for some period of time, and your information may also be retained by Google and Facebook in accordance with their privacy policies.

By using our Website and Services, you consent to your personal information being transferred to and from these third parties and processed and stored by them, and having them transfer your data to other countries, including countries that have different data protection rules than your country. We do not represent that our Website and Services or that these third party services are appropriate or available in any particular jurisdiction.

### Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to _[privacy@dailyom.com](mailto:privacy@dailyom.com)_ or write us at: 133 E. De La Guerra Street #70, Santa Barbara, CA 93101.

California imposes certain legal requirements regarding “Do Not Track” disclosures. The internet browsers that you use to visit our Website may provide certain “Do Not Track” capabilities. Generally, browsers that have these features send a signal to web sites that inform the site operator that you do not wish for the site to track you. We do not respond to these signals because there is not yet a common understanding of how to process these signals or a consensus on what “tracking” means.

### Data Security

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls, and we implement the services of a third party hosting company to provide backup services. We do not store any credit card information that you may supply to us.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you the ability to choose a password for access to certain parts of our Website or to obtain certain Services available through the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website or in connection with our Services. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.

For information about our third party service providers’ policies regarding data security, please see the section captioned “Third Party Services” above.

If you reside in the European Union, you have the right under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (GDPR), to request from us access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data, the right to data portability, the right to restriction of processing of your personal data, the right to object to processing of your personal data, and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
