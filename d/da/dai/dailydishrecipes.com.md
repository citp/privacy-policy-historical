# Disclosures/Privacy Policy - Daily Dish Recipes

**Affiliate Disclosure**

Sometimes in a blog post, I include affiliate links. What is an affiliate link? It’s a link to another site which offers me some form of compensation for sending them visitors or customers. This is mostly true for the couponing websites I use, but many others too. It won’t hurt you, and nothing bad happens, but if you sign up, I might receive some form of compensation or another.

The income that I generate from these links goes right back into this website. It helps me maintain my blog and pay for hosting. You will never find an affiliate link for a company I don’t have a very positive experience with. If you find a link that is an affiliate link, you can trust that I support that company whole-heartedly, or it wouldn’t be there.
