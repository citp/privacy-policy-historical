				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

				<p>Savoteur.com (“Site”) is provided by Daily Secret Inc., and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries, including Daily Lists, LLC, the publishing and newsletter platform, Sugar High, and the e-mail and newsletter platform, Savoteur (together, “DS”  “We,” or “Us”) and includes our mobile application, newsletters, and other features, content and functionality offered from us from time to time (together, the “Services”). DStakes very seriously the private nature of your personal information. It is the goal of DS to bring you information that is relevant and targeted to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our Site and/or register for our email publication. Please read this notice carefully.</p>

				<h2>I. PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

				<p>In order to distribute our email publication, we (obviously) need your e-mail address. So that we may provide you with additional services as well as more interesting and relevant content, we may request additional personal information. DS does not collect any other personal information that you do not expressly provide. DS WILL NOT DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANY THIRD PARTY WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT, EXCEPT AS DETAILED BELOW IN SECTION IV.</p>

				<h2>II. NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

				<p>We may also request non-personally identifiable information, for example, occupation. This information, also known as demographic and profile data, is optional. We may use this data to improve our site and/or personalize your experience at our site, in order to bring you more targeted and relevant content and to display such content according to your preferences. We may share this information with others, such as advertisers interested on advertising on the DS site but never on an individual level. This information will only be shared in an aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person. However, we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.</p>

				<h2>III. USAGE INFORMATION</h2>

				<p>In addition to collecting personal and non-personal information, DS may also collect non-personal, aggregated information about subscribers’ use of our emails and our site. This information is not personally identifiable and will only be used to find out how subscribers use our service and site. For example, this information will tell us how much time users spend on our site, from which other sites subscribers came, and to what other sites subscribers go. The collection of this information allows us to, among other things, prepare for traffic load demands and to efficiently distribute our email publication.</p>

				<h2>IV. INFORMATION SHARING PROVISION</h2>

				<p>DS may share information with carefully selected vendors and business partners with whom we work. This includes companies that offer affinity, frequent-user, and reward programs and sweepstakes prizing and sponsorship; and, companies that perform marketing services and other business operations for us (including providing goods and services to our users, as necessary to complete transactions you request). All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep all information confidential and to use the customer information only to provide the services we ask them to perform for you and us.</p>

				<p>We provide services and products through third parties. These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal or email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service.</p>

				<p>As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

				<p>We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers; sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third party vendors, but these statistics do not include Personal Information. We may disclose Personal Information we collect from you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of other users of our Site; or (c) to act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of users of our Site or the public.</p>

				<h2>V. REVIEW AND ACCESS</h2>

				<p>You will have the ability to access the information that we have collected about you. You will have an opportunity to correct, update or modify this information.</p>

				<h2>VI. CHOICE/OPT-OUT</h2>

				<p>If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an e-mail address by which you may request no future notices.</p>

				<h2>VII. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</h2>

				<p>Some of the ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by our web advertising partners. Information about your visit to their site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.</p>

				<h2>VIII. TRACKING &amp; THIRD PARTY COOKIES</h2>

				<p>You may have read about “cookies” or bits of information that are placed by a Website in a storage place on your own computer.

Some of our advertisers may serve you cookies as well. Unfortunately, we do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. If you don’t want cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you to not accept them.</p>

				<h2>IX. IP ADDRESS</h2>

				<p>Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university. We may, from time to time, use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad demographic information and administer our Site.</p>

				<h2>X. LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h2>

				<p>As part of our Services, DS may create links allowing you to access third party sites. DS is not responsible for the content that appears on those sites and does not endorse these sites. Please consult those sites’ individual privacy policies in order to determine how they treat user information.</p>

				<h2>XI. SECURITY</h2>

				<p>We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to assist us in preventing unauthorized access, maintaining data accuracy, and correctly using your Personal Information. Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to your Personal Information to the employees, agents, and officers of DS who need the information for their jobs.</p>

				<h2>XII. MODIFICATION TO THIS POLICY</h2>
