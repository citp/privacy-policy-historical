# Privacy Policy - Daily Makeover

Makeover Solutions, Inc. (sometimes referred to as “MOS”, “we”, “us”) is committed to ensuring your privacy protection.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to help you understand the kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit our Web Site,  
www.dailymakeover.com (the “Web Site”), or use any of the services offered on the Web Site, how we may use that information, in which manner we will disclose  
it, and how you can correct and/or update the information. Please note that be using the Web Site (and the services offered on the Web Site), you signify your  
agreement with this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Web Site or its services.

Please note that the Policy applies only to the Web Site and its services, but not to other websites to which we may link, or to third parties or  
advertisers on the Web Site. Additionally, your use of the Web Sites and the Web Site’s services is governed by all applicable laws, the Web Site’s Terms of  
Use, as well as by any other published rules pertaining to either the Web Site or applicable service.

### Personal Information We Collect

Personal information is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual such as your name, email address, home address, and phone number.  
We collect personally identifiable information from you explicitly, and only when you voluntarily provide it to us or in instances in which you must provide  
such information in order to participate in activities on the Web Site. By way of example only, you will provide personal information to us when you register  
to use the Web Site, when you fill out a form, consummate transactions, or enter into contests, drawings or surveys.

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect

When you visit the Web Site and interact with the services and tools that reside here, we and third parties with which we have to provide services to us may  
collect non-personal information on your actions. This “non-personally identifiable information” that we collect includes information such as how many users  
log on to the Web Site on a daily basis or view a particular article. This type of information may be automatically collected from you in connection with your  
use of the Web Site and the services offered on the Web Site, and is generally collected from two sources — from the server log files and the other is from  
cookies.

### IP Address

Your IP address is a number that is assigned by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) to your computer to identify its location. We use your IP address to  
help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website.

### Cookies

The Web Site uses a feature of your browser to set a “cookie” on your computer. Cookies are small packets of information that the Web Site’s computer stores  
on your computer. The information in the cookie is transmitted from your computer to us, our agents, or to one of our third-party authorized service  
contractors and business partners. The information contained in these cookies makes it possible for us to know if you are presently logged onto the Web Site or  
whether you have done so in a prior visit. This technology also enables us to instantly determine your access privileges while allowing you to navigate the Web  
Site or any of the Web Site’s services without your having to repeatedly log in.

Cookies from us and/or one of our authorized service contractors or business partners are also used to collect standard information transmitted from your  
web browser including, without limitation: your Internet protocol address, browser type, web pages you visited with date and time, purchases you made from us  
on the Web Site and the type of operating system on your computer. This information is used to help us understand and meet the ever-changing needs and  
interests of our visitors and members.

We may also use cookies to track your access to, and use of the bulletin boards on the Web Site, as well as your responses to any of our online surveys. We  
do not control any cookies you may receive from an advertiser or other third party and these cookies are not subject to this Policy, although the advertiser  
may have their own policy.

We also use web beacon technology to help track site usage. Web beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) allow us to track page viewing counts  
and patterns which we use to focus and tailor future content development, measure the effectiveness of our own marketing campaigns and assist with broadband  
capacity management for the Web Site. We also may employ web beacons within the context of certain e-mails in order to determine the effectiveness and appeal  
of those mailings. These web beacons ‘sense’ and notify us if and when you open the e-mail, if your e-mail program is capable of displaying HTML messages, and  
where you may navigate within these HTML messages.

You may modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. You have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a  
cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies you may be unable to use the Web Site’s services that require registration in order to  
participate or will have to sign in each time you visit the Web Site.

### How We Use the Information We Collect

DailyMakeover.com keeps your personal information private and will not share it with any third parties without your consent. We use the information  
collected, including personally identifiable information, for a variety of purposes. For example, we use your information to better understand your needs and  
provide you with better products and services. We may use your information to respond to your inquiries or requests, communicate with you, update you on  
products, services and benefits, alert you to promotional offers, personalize the Web Site for you, contact you for market research, provide you with marketing  
information, newsletters or other information we think would be of particular interest.

We may also share your personally identifiable information and/or aggregate information with our affiliates, technical consultants, third party auditors and  
other third parties who work with us to create or maintain the Web Site, enhance its functionality or provide associated services and/or deal with you in  
processing your orders and/or delivering content, samples, products, services and gifts and prizes.

Our advertising is currently served by third party advertising companies which deliver a cookie to you so the ads you see can be tracked and ensure that you  
are not shown the same ad too many times. Since the third party advertising company only tags your computer with a number, they know nothing about who you are.  
We do not provide these third party advertising companies with any personally identifiable information. However, these companies may use non-personally  
identifiable information about your visits to the Web Site and other sites with which they have arrangements in order to provide advertisements about goods and  
services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these  
companies, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp) and [here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy)

Please note that we reserve the right to access and/or disclose personal information and aggregate information we gather, as required by courts or  
administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation,  
the Web Site’s rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which we deem to be improper.

### Targeted Advertising

We believe that advertising on the Internet is more interesting to the user when it is relevant. Therefore, through the use of your non-personally  
identifiable information and technologies such as cookies, we and our business partners may deliver advertisements that are targeted towards your particular  
interests and your behavior on the Internet. This is sometimes called behavioral advertising.

Advertising may be delivered to you based upon the non-personally identifiable information you have provided to us (such as your interests and demographic  
data) and non-personally identifiable information we collect ourselves from you (such as the pages you have viewed on the Web Site or articles you have  
accessed). For instance, if you expressed an interest in cosmetics or have been reading material on the Site about cosmetics, we may serve advertisements  
specifically to you regarding this topic. These targeted advertisements may also appear on the web sites of our business partners which are not owned or  
controlled by MOS.

If you do not want to receive such targeted advertisements, then follow the instructions in the section titled “Cookies” on modifying your browser settings  
relating to cookies.

### Message Board and Chats

Among the many services we offer on the Web Site, we provide voluntary message boards, chat rooms and other interactive forums. Please be aware that we make  
no commitment to monitor these forums. Furthermore, any information which you may post to a forum, including your personally identifiable information, will be  
disclosed and available to all users of that forum, and is therefore no longer private. By using the forums, you agree that we are not responsible for any  
information that you disclose or communicate online in such forums, and any disclosures you make are at your own risk. We reserve the right to republish your  
postings (in whole or part), taken from the forums, anywhere on the Web Site or elsewhere on the Web in any format or any other medium, including print and  
radio, and may include the author’s Web Site member name, without prior notice or your express consent.

### Children’s Information

Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from individuals under thirteen years of age. The Web Site and the  
services offered on the Web Site are not directed or intended for children under thirteen years of age. If you are under thirteen years of age, you should not  
register to become an All-Access Member or provide personally identifiable information on the Web Site. If you are the parent or guardian of a child whom you  
believe has disclosed personally identifiable information to us, please contact us at [privacy@dailymakeover.com](https://web.archive.org/contact/6) so that we may delete  
and remove such child’s information from our systems.

### Disclosure of Personal Information in the Event of Merger or Sale of Assets

MOS, its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity, or all or substantially all of their respective  
assets could be acquired, or the assets of this Web Site could be acquired or transferred to another business entity. Should such a combination, acquisition,  
transaction or transfer occur, we reserve the right to transfer some or all of your personally identifiable information and other information to our successors  
in business and purchasers (in whole or in part) of this Web Site’s assets.

### Co-branded and Other Affiliated Sites

Certain information or services offered or provided through the Web Site may, from time to time, be provided on or through other websites operated by or in  
conjunction with third parties (“Partners”). These websites and their features may have the same “look and feel” as the Web Site. We term these websites  
“co-branded sites”, and often times a Partner’s logo or name may appear, or the Partner’s name may be part of the URL. Although we will retain any personally  
identifiable information collected about you from one of these co-branded sites, such information may also be shared by us with that Partner. A Partner’s use  
of any information shared will be subject to the Partner’s own privacy practices and policies.

### Third Party Links

We do not monitor, control or endorse the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties including, without limitation, any Partner,  
advertiser or other third party that may provide services on the Web Site. On behalf of various sponsors, the Web Site may provide sponsored links to  
third-party websites or resources (“Linked Sites”). We neither control nor have we reviewed or approved the content that appears on such Linked Sites. Even  
though certain information collected by such third parties might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with their privacy  
practices, and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices.

### Security

We place a priority on the security of personally identifiable information, and we undertake reasonable security measures to protect the data that resides  
on our servers. We also use secure server software (SSL) to process all transactions which occur on the Web Site. SSL encrypts your personal information  
transmitted over the Internet, including your credit card number, name and address. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot warrant or guaranty  
the security of its servers, nor can we guarantee that information supplied by All-Access Members or other users will not be intercepted while being  
transmitted over the Internet.

### Correction/Updating Personal Information – Opt-Out

If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your address, zip code), or if you no longer desire to use or access the Web Site or any of its  
services, we encourage you to correct, update or remove the personal information that you provided. This can be done at the “Manage My Account” page for the  
Web Site. Keep in mind, however, that even if you delete your account from our records, there will be residual information that will remain within our  
databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain personally identifiable information. We are not responsible for updating or removing  
any information contained in third-party lists or databases.

### Privacy Policy Changes

This Policy was last changed in March 2008. If we make changes to any of the terms or conditions of the Policy, this document will be revised so that you  
will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and to whom we will disclose it. We reserve the right to change, modify, add or  
remove portions of this Policy at any time and without notice, and any changes will become effective immediately upon being posted unless we advise you  
otherwise. Your continued use of the Web Site and the services offered on the Web Site after this Policy has been amended shall be deemed to be your continued  
acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Policy, as amended. We encourage you to bookmark this web page and review this Policy regularly.
