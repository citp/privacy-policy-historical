This privacy policy, which we adapted from a policy originally provided by [Automattic](http://www.automattic.com/), describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use our websites. Please read this notice very carefully.

* ###  Website Visitors

Like most website operators, DailyPicdump collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. DailyPicdump’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how DailyPicdump’s visitors use its website. From time to time, DailyPicdump may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

DailyPicdump also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DailyPicdump does not use such information to identify its visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
