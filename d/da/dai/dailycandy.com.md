##### Personal Information

In order to supply you with your DailyCandy email, we need your email address. Similarly, in order to supply you with text-messaging services, we need your phone number and your provider information. So that we may provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, geographical coordinates, and telephone number. DailyCandy does not collect any other personal information that you do not expressly provide. DailyCandy will never sell, rent, or share your personal information, including your email address, with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.

##### Non-Personal Information

DailyCandy may also request non-personally identifiable information, such as annual income, buying preferences, or age, also known as demographic and profile data. Though this information is optional, we may use it to improve our site and/or tailor your experience on our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in and displaying content according to your preferences. We may also share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in advertising in the DailyCandy email or on the site, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person.

##### Usage Information

In addition to collecting personal and non-personal information, DailyCandy may also collect non-personal, aggregated information about subscribers' use of DailyCandy emails and the website. This information is not personally identifiable and will be used only to find out how subscribers use our service and site. For example, this information will tell us how much time users spend on the DailyCandy site, from which sites subscribers came, and to what sites subscribers go. The collection of this information allows us to, among other things, prepare for traffic load demands and to efficiently deliver your Candy.

##### Review and Access

Upon your request, we will provide you with a summary of the information we collect about you. You will have an opportunity to correct, update, or modify this information.

##### Choice/Opt Out

If we ever send you information by email concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an email address by which you may request no future notices.

They allow us to quickly check your status as a subscriber and facilitate access to your preferences.
