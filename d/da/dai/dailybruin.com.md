# Privacy policy | Daily Bruin

### Visitors

Like most website operators, the Daily Bruin collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The Daily Bruin’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how the Daily Bruin’s visitors use its website. The Daily Bruin also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The Daily Bruin does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to the Daily Bruin’s websites choose to interact with the Daily Bruin in ways that require the Daily Bruin to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that the Daily Bruin gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment to an email address. In each case, the Daily Bruin collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the Daily Bruin. The Daily Bruin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

the Daily Bruin may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, the Daily Bruin may monitor the most popular articles or comments on the dailybruin.com site. The Daily Bruin may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, the Daily Bruin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

the Daily Bruin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on the Daily Bruin’s behalf or to provide services available at the Daily Bruin’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Daily Bruin’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. The Daily Bruin will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, the Daily Bruin discloses potentially personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when the Daily Bruin believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the Daily Bruin, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. The Daily Bruin takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
