<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>






	






	

	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="1">Last Updated: May 2006</font></p>
<p>dailypress.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet 
  technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may 
  use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, 
  telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. Please note this 
  policy applies only to information collected by dailypress.com online and does 
  not impact information collected or used by dailypress.com or its affiliates 
  through other means. </p>
<p><strong>How we gather information from users.</strong></p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 
  the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. 
  You can visit many pages on our site without providing any information. Other 
  pages may prompt you to provide information, such as when you register for access 
  to portions of our site, sign up for membership, request certain features (e.g., 
  newsletters, news updates and other products), sign up for a newspaper subscription 
  or make a purchase. You may also provide information when you participate in 
  sweepstakes and contests, voting and polling activities, message boards and 
  chat rooms and other interactive areas of our site.<br>
  <br>
  Like most Web sites, dailypress.com also collects information automatically 
  and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. 
  For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use “cookie” 
  technology. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, 
  sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or 
  may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while 
  visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information 
  through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with 
  information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, 
  but doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the site or 
  may require you to re-enter your user name and password. Additionally we may 
  not be able to customize the site’s features according to your preferences.</p>
<p><strong>What we do with the information we collect.</strong></p>
<p>We will use your information only as permitted by law. Aggregated Information 
  (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. 
  As one example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar 
  information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited most 
  or what features are most attractive. Aggregated Information may occasionally 
  be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to 
  contact you individually.</p>
<p>We also collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized 
  content and advertising. For example, we may use Personally Identifiable Information 
  collected on dailypress.com to communicate with you regarding our <a href="/services/site/dp-news-tos,0,6862928.htmlstory"><strong>Terms 
  of Service</strong></a> and privacy policy, products and services offered by 
  Dailypress.com and other Tribune Company affiliates and partners, administration 
  of sweepstakes and contests, processing e-commerce transactions and other topics 
  we think you might find of interest. We reserve the right to share this information 
  with other Tribune Company business units and affiliates, including for example 
  our affiliated newspapers and entities in which Tribune Company has an ownership 
  interest (collectively, “Affiliates”). This policy does not apply 
  to any Affiliate’s use of such information.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by dailypress.com may also be 
  used for other purposes including but not limited to site administration and 
  troubleshooting. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the 
  operation of our site (our Web hosting service and our newsletter provider, 
  for example) may access such information.</p>
<p>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner 
  with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may 
  be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response 
  to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required 
  to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to 
  us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information 
  to law enforcement authorities. Please note we may not provide you with notice 
  prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p><strong>Your choice to opt out.</strong></p>
<p>The quality news and information on dailypress.com is supported by advertising 
  revenue and a controlled program of e-mail marketing is an important element 
  of our online publishing business. Like other Web publishers, we sometimes permit 
  our advertising and promotional partners to e-mail you about services, features, 
  products, special offers and unique content we believe might interest you. If 
  you prefer not to receive e-mail communications sent directly from our advertisers 
  or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to decline before 
  you provide us information we might use for this purpose. If you decline at 
  the time you provide us such information, we will not share the Personally Identifiable 
  Information you provide with non-Affiliated advertisers for such purposes, though 
  we may on occasion send you information on their behalf. </p>
<p><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements.</strong></p>
<p>dailypress.com expects its partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates 
  to respect the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our partners, 
  advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, 
  may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, 
  during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on 
  a dailypress.com page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by 
  a third party. Also, through dailypress.com you may be introduced to, or be 
  able to access, information, Web sites, advertisements, features, contests or 
  sweepstakes offered by other parties. dailypress.com is not responsible for 
  the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable 
  privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature 
  or page operated by a third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties 
  may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences 
  or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served 
  by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine 
  whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features available 
  on our site, third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
  dailypress.com does not control the use of this technology or the resulting 
  information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third 
  parties.</p>
<p>A cookie gets entered by your Web browser into the "Cookies" folder on your hard drive after you close your browser, and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site.  We use persistent and session cookies to analyze and enhance your experience on the Site, and use third party ad technology to serve ads.   The data that is collected is the property of dailypress.com, not the third party.  We also allow third parties called ad networks or ad servers to serve ads to you on dailypress.com. Cookies enable them to compile information about where you, or others who have used your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on.   This information makes it possible for the ad technology, ad servers and ad networks to deliver targeted advertisements to you on dailypress.com. Dailypress.com does not have access to the cookies that may be placed on your computer by third-party ad technology, ad servers or ad networks. Dailypress.com maintains relationships with a number of third-party networks, including Doubleclick, Unicast, and Pointroll.  Those parties that use cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting.  You may find more information at the Web site of the individual ad network or the 
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp"> Network Advertising Initiative.</a></p>
<p>Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Should you choose 
  to voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on our site, such 
  as in message boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you post, that 
  information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties 
  without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals 
  or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of dailypress.com and 
  this policy.</p>
<p><strong>Children.</strong></p>
<p>dailypress.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable 
  Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we 
  discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation 
  of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe 
  dailypress.com has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact 
  us at the address listed below.</p>

<p> <strong>Changes to this policy.</strong></p>
<p>dailypress.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please 
  check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following 
  the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information

<p><strong>Governing law.</strong></p>
<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Illinois law. Any claim

  for the resolution of disputes concerning this policy. dailypress.com is controlled, 
  operated and administered entirely within the United States. If you are located 
  outside the United States, please note the information you provide to us will 
  be transferred to the United States. You hereby consent to this transfer. </p>
<p>In the event case of any conflict between the terms of this policy and the 
  terms of any electronic or machine readable privacy policy (for example, a P3P 
  electronic privacy policy), the terms of this written policy shall control.<br>
