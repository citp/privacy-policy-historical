**PRIVACY POLICY**

**Subject:**

This page describes the procedures used to manage the website with regard to the processing of its Users' personal data.

The information statement is also provided pursuant to Article 13 of Legislative Decree no. 196/2003 - Privacy Code to those who interact with the company's web services, accessible by telematic means at the address: [http://www.dainese.com](http://www.dainese.com/) corresponding to the initial page of the company's website (hereinafter referred to as the Website).

The information statement is provided only for the Website in question but not for other websites eventually accessed by Users via links.

**Data Controller**

After consulting this Website, data concerning identified or identifiable persons may be processed. Processing of data, which may directly or indirectly identify you, will be carried out only where strictly necessary. The Website has therefore been configured in such a way as to ensure that the use of Personal Data has been minimised and to exclude processing of personal data when the purposes pursued in the individual cases can be achieved by using anonymous data (for example, market research aimed at improving services) or carried out in other ways, which enable identification of the data subject only where strictly necessary or required by the authorities and police forces (for example, for data relating to traffic, time spent on the Website or your IP address).

The “Data Controller” for processing is Dainese S.p.A. – Via dell’Artigianato n. 35 – 36060 Molvena (VI).

**Place of personal data processing**

Data processing related to the web services of this Website is only handled by the technical staff of the Office in charge of processing, or by those authorised to carry out occasional maintenance operations. No data arising from the web service is communicated or disclosed.

Personal data provided by Users who submit requests to be sent informational materials (commercial or technical information, newsletters, etc.) are used exclusively for the purposes indicated in the information statements in the sections regarding the Website, and are disclosed to third parties only if this is necessary for that purpose.

The technical management of this Website is also overseen by companies located outside the European Union. Consequently, the staff of these companies may have access to personal data but only in the case of exceptional requirements related to the technical operation of the Website. Contractual agreements have been established with these persons and comply with the provisions of current legislation and European Regulations on personal data processing.

Likewise, personal data may be processed by staff at subsidiaries of Dainese S.p.A., also located outside the European Union, with which contractual agreements have been stipulated in compliance with the provisions of current legislation and European Regulations on personal data processing.

**Types of data processed**

Navigation data

During normal operation, the IT systems and software procedures used to run this Website acquire some personal data, whose transmission is implicit to the use of Internet communication protocols.

Such information is not collected in order to be associated with identified data subjects but, by their very nature may allow Users to be identified through processing and association with data held by third parties.

This category of data includes IP addresses or domain names of computers used by Users who access the Website, URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) addresses of requested resources, the time of the request, the procedure used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file received in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (success, failure, etc.) and other parameters related to the User's operating system and computer environment.

Such data are used for the sole purpose of obtaining anonymous statistical data on the use of the Website and checking its correct operation, and are immediately deleted after processing. The data might be used to ascertain responsibility in the event of hypothetical computer crimes against the Website.

Data voluntarily provided by the User

The optional, explicit and voluntary sending of e-mails to the addresses indicated on this Website implies the subsequent acquisition of the sender's address, required to reply to requests, and of any other personal data included in the message.

Specific information may be given or displayed on the pages of the Website dedicated to specific services on request.

Cookies

For information about the cookies used on the Website, please consult the page containing the _Cookie Policy_.

**Optional provision of data**

In some modules, information may be highlighted, whose provision is essential for providing the requested service. For such modules, compilation is optional.

Failure to provide essential information will make it impossible to fulfil the request.

**Processing methods**

Personal data are processed using automated tools for the time strictly necessary to fulfil the purposes for which they were collected.

Specific security measures are observed to prevent the loss of data, illegal or incorrect use and unauthorised access.

**Rights of data subjects**

At any time, data subjects may exercise their rights to obtain confirmation of the existence or not of such data and to ascertain their content and origin, check their accuracy or ask for the data to be integrated, updated or corrected (Article 7 of Legislative Decree no. 196/2003).

Under the same article, data subjects are entitled to request the deletion, conversion into anonymous form or blockage of any data processed in violation of the law, and to refuse processing, in any circumstance, for legitimate reasons.
