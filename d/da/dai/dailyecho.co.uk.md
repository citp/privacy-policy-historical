# Privacy Policy

### Our newspapers

We are journalists and it is our business to gather, assess, create and present news and information. We will publish that news and information in any media, principally in print and online. We may pass this news and information to other publishers in the UK or abroad. Such news and information may contain personal data of all kinds, including names, addresses, photographs and sensitive personal data. We comply with the law in connection with the conduct of our business, including the Data Protection Act 1998 and the general law of privacy. We are also regulated by the Independent Press Standards Organisation and subject to the Editors’ Code, which includes provisions relating to personal privacy and intrusion. If you have a complaint about one of our newspapers, you should first contact the editor at the address given in the relevant local print edition or website. Details of the Editors’ Code, the work of IPSO and its complaints process can be found at [www.ipso.co.uk](http://www.ipso.co.uk/)). We also host on our websites content which is produced and posted by third parties, such as readers’ comments. We do not select, edit or monitor such third-party content, but we do respond to complaints. If you have a complaint about it, you should use the ‘report this post’ facility provided on the website. 

Publishing companies in the Newsquest Media Group do not store or capture personal data about you when you visit one of our sites, other than to record the IP address of your computer or device, your web browser and the number of pages you view during a visit.

We use the information only for system administration and to help us evaluate use of the network of Newsquest websites so that we can continue to develop and improve our online services. In addition, the information is used anonymously in order to recommend to you and others content that may be of interest.

Where any personal data, like your name and address, is requested you will always be advised why it is needed, what it will be used for and how you can contact us to have the details amended or deleted. Personal information can be collected by us from you when you register for a news, property or job alert by email; comment on an article; request services from us or third parties connected with us; email us; use our website; participate in promotions; enter competitions or otherwise provide your personal details.

For example, you would need to fill in your name and address for competition entries, letters to the editor, or when you are accessing transactional services like booking advertisements online. 

In these transactional environments, you will also need to have cookies enabled (see our **[cookies policy](https://web.archive.org/my/account/cookiespolicy/)** ). You can decide if you want to accept cookies by changing the settings on your computer. If you do not accept cookies some features on our sites will not work as intended and the services we can supply to you will be significantly reduced. For instance, this will affect the delivery of advertisements, pop-ups and sub-sites, as well as transactional elements of booking advertisements online. It will also affect the use of forums, reader comments and message boards. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. For more information, read our **[cookies policy](https://web.archive.org/my/account/cookiespolicy/)**.
