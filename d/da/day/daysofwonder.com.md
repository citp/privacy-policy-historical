# Days of Wonder Privacy Policy - Get Board Game Fever! | Days of Wonder

|  | 

Days of Wonder is committed to protecting your online privacy when using our web sites. We do not collect and keep any personal information from you unless you volunteer it. We also do not collect and keep personal information online from children under the age of 13 without their parent's consent. Please review the information below to familiarize yourself with our policies on Web site privacy. This site and the servers that make this site available are located in France. By using this site you agree to the transfer, collection, processing and use of data by this site. Some of our Days of Wonder family of Web sites offer different features and may collect different types of personal information for different purposes and activities.

A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS: Days of Wonder adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Parents should monitor their children's online use. Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without your permission.

If you are under 18, please read this policy with your parents. Children under 13 should get your parent's permission before giving out your e-mail address or any personal information to Days of Wonder or anyone else on the internet.

## Collection of Personal Information

Days of Wonder does not require anyone to share any personal information in order to enjoy any of our Web sites. That means you can visit our sites without any need to register with us. However, most of our sites contain special sections and privileges for members that register. We do not collect any personal information from you or your teenager unless it is voluntarily provided, for instance when registering for online play, contests, downloads, or free demos, to participate in forums, completing online customer surveys or purchasing products. We attempt to limit the personal information we ask for, only to what is required to provide you with the requested service. Those who are under the age of 18 may only purchase products from our online stores with the permission of their parents or legal guardians.

## Children's Privacy

We do not collect personal information online from children under 13 without their parent's consent except in special, limited circumstances. If your child is under 13 and wants to participate in online game play, forums or other areas that require personal information, a parent or guardian must mail or fax a signed permission form to the administrator of this website before a user under the age of 13 can complete registration. With verifiable consent, we may collect personal information from your child such as a last name, address or e-mail address when the information is necessary for a particular activity. When we ask for your permission we will tell you how you can review your child's information and ask us to delete the information.

To protect their privacy online, your child may use a "Login Name" that is not their real name.

If you no longer wish your child to participate in any website activities that require the collection or use of personal information, contact our [Customer Service](http://www.daysofwonder.com/en/about/contact/). Upon proper identification, parents may review the personal information we have collected about their child, request deletion, or refuse to allow further collection or use. You may also write to us at Days of Wonder, Inc, Attn: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 334 State Street, Suite 203, Los Altos, CA 94022. However, if you ask us to delete your child's information, we may have to ask your child not to participate in our activities.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, effective April 21, 2000, applies to the online collection of personal information from children under 13. The new rules spell out what a Web site operator must include in a privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent and what responsibilities an operator has to protect children's privacy and safety online.

## Our Use of Collected Information

We use the personal information we collect for the purposes indicated at the time you or your teenager or child (with your consent) provides such information. For instance, if you register in a contest, we will use the registration information to notify contest winners, or if you purchase a product, we will use the information to fulfill the order. Occasionally, and only with consent at the time we ask for information, we might also e-mail or mail you or your teenager or your child to provide information on upcoming Days of Wonder products, Web site updates and promotions. If you want to stop receiving such updates and product information from Days of Wonder or our affiliates at any time, just contact our [Customer Service](http://www.daysofwonder.com/en/about/contact/). Our mailings and e-mails will also include information allowing you to ask not to receive such information in the future.

## The Sharing of Personal Information

Days of Wonder will never share, sell, rent or otherwise provide your personal information to any outside companies or other party without your explicit consent. If you consent, Days of Wonder may provide your information to outside companies that offer products or services that may be of interest. Except as described in this policy, we never share personal information that we receive online from children under 13 with other companies outside of Days of Wonder. We will remove your name from the list we provide to outside companies if you just e-mail our Customer Service. In special circumstances, Days of Wonder may give other companies access to our information database, but only if necessary to allow them to provide database or server maintenance or security, help us process and fulfill orders or requests, or provide other similar services to Days of Wonder. If we do provide access, we require those other companies to sign confidentiality agreements promising to keep secret any information they see. If Days of Wonder believes that anyone's behavior on our sites may damage us or our sites or anyone else, we may disclose the relevant personal information in order to prevent this harm. In that case, we might try to identify the wrongdoer, contact them or bring legal action against them. We may also disclose personal information if we believe that the disclosure is required by law, or in response to a legal request.

## Use of Cookies

A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer's hard drive which contains non-personal information. Cookies help us give you faster access to pages you have already visited, allow you to personalize your pages, and they help you to participate in some online activities on our sites. For administrative purposes, we also collect IP addresses, which is the automatic number assigned to your computer when you surf the Web. Your IP address and cookie is not connected to any personally identifiable or online contact information, so you remain anonymous to us.
