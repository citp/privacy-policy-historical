## The Way We Use Information

We use email addresses that you may submit for our own outreach and announcements. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design Day of the Shirt, to suggest popular content to users, and to share with advertisers and publishers. For example:

When information is used in this or a similar manner, we do not disclose anything that could be used to identify the individuals on whom the information is based.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims. We may disclose your information when we believe it necessary or desirable in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our policies, and/or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
