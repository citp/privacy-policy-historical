This type of information is only collected from you voluntarily; we will never gather or store such information without your knowledge and consent. Examples of where we might gather such information from you: when you sign up to receive e-mail updates or newsletters about the Site, our products, or services; to allow you to register or update your individual profile on the Site; to help personalize the Site for you; or to allow you to provide feedback, or ask a question. In some situations, you will need to provide some or all of the above-described personally identifiable information in order for certain personalized features of the Site to function properly (e.g., company and product email alerts).

We may use such information to contact you about our products, company or other related marketing or promotional purposes.

We do not share personally identifiable information collected at this Site with third parties, except for the limited instances noted below. The exceptions are:

  * In the event of an acquisition of all or part of dayriffer.com by another company, or in the event that dayriffer.com was to sell or dispose of all or a part of its business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by dayriffer.com, which could include personally identifiable information, subject to applicable law. Similarly, information may be transferred as part of a reorganization or insolvency proceeding.



We may on occasion combine information we receive with outside records or Site usage information to enhance our consumer profiles for our own marketing and development purposes (in accordance with this Privacy Policy).

Although we use reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of your personally identifiable data and information, due to technological limitations, and the risk of unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions and/or data, we cannot completely assure you, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable data and information, and any other electronically communicated information, will be absolutely confidential.

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We also collect and store non-personally identifiable information, such as visitor traffic, page hits, Site referral information, browser information, downloads, and general Site use information through typical Internet data collection tools, such as web beacons, cookies, and embedded web links.

The Site may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and for other similar purposes.
