										When visitors supply information about

										For example, you may be asked to give us

										apply for a job. The information may 
										range from your zip code, to your phone

										The registration forms request accurate

										the "Dazzle Yellow Pages Family" unless you 
										specifically authorize it, to complete a 
										transaction that you initiated, it is

										provide personally identifiable

										<br>
										However, you need to understand that 
										some websites/ad serving companies have 
										the ability to reestablish your history 
										even after cookie deletion, if you 
										reenter the same site on another 
										occasion, or some other site tracked by 
										the ad serving company/network, and 
										specifically provide personal data. <br>
										<br>
										Deletion of cookies alone does not 
										prevent ad serving companies from 
										reestablishing history on a visitor. The 
										visitor must either continue to decline 
										cookies each time it reenters the site 
										to keep the tracking severed, if 
										desired, or opt-out. When you opt-out, 
										your unique user ID cookie is erased and 
										you are reassigned an anonymous, non-id 
										cookie. This new cookie tells websites 
										that you have opted out and they will 
										then know not to attempt to assign other 
										cookies to you in the future. Opt-out 
										cookies do not contain a unique user ID 
										number therefore websites are not able 
										to identify your computer uniquely. <br>
										<br>
										Customers who choose to continually 
										delete cookies and not opt out can have 
										their browser advise them each time a 
										web site attempts to send a cookie to 
										your system. At that time, you can 
										choose to either Accept or Cancel a 
										cookie. <br>
										<br>
										Customers who choose to "opt out" after 
										deleting cookies will receive an 
										anonymous/non personally identifiable 
										cookie.<br>

										<b>Does Dazzle Yellow Pages use the information

										We may disclose personal information 
										when required by law or in the good

										<br>
										<b>How do I know I am on a secured site?</b>
										<br>
										Every secure page on this web site has 
										been secured with a digital certificate. 
										You know you are on a secure page of 
										this web site when you see a lock in the 
										status bar at the bottom of your 
										browser. In Internet Explorer, you can 
										view your status bar by clicking on 
										View, Status Bar. When you see the lock, 
										double click it and a popup window opens 
										and displays who issued the digital 
										certificate securing that page and the 
										dates it is valid. <br>
										<br>
										<b>How does Dazzle Yellow Pages prevent unauthorized 
										access to my account information?</b>
										<br>
										Your password is set at a minimum of six 
										characters, which provides added 
										protection for your personal 
										information. On secured pages, this site 
										uses SSL encryption up to 128-bits. <br>
										<br>
										<b>What security measures are in place 
										to restrict access to personal data?</b>
										<br>
										There are a variety of security measures 
										in place that limits internal access to 
										data stored by the Dazzle Yellow Pages site. Access 
										is restricted to authorized personnel 
										only and requires an employee to have a 
										secure ID and password to access the 
										information. In addition, logs are 
										reviewed regularly to spot any 
										inconsistencies. The site is continually 
										updated with the latest known security 
										patches that are periodically published 
										by the system vendor. Any information 
										that you give is password protected. For 
										your protection, the system 
										automatically locks out a user after 3 
										incorrect tries and after 20 minutes of 
										idle time per secure session. If you 
										forget your password, you will be 
										prompted to supply your customer ID 
										number and your password will be 
										e-mailed to you. <br>
										<br>
										<b>What information is stored by the 
										site or in cookies?</b> <br>
										Registration information, bill and 
										online shopping, data and contact e-mail 
										addresses are stored in Dazzle Yellow 
										Pages 
										databases which are physically secure 
										environments that are not accessible via 
										the Internet. This information is only 
										available to you through the use of a 
										secure ID and password, and the 
										information is transferred from our 
										databases for your viewing. <br>
										<br>
										A cookie is a small, encrypted data 
										string our server writes to your hard
