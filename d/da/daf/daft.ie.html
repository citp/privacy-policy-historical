	Daft does not employ or manage.

   </ul><br>
   
    <h2 id="personal">Personal information collected</h2>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	When you visit, register or use the services on this Site, you may be asked to provide certain information about 
	yourself, including your name and your contact details. We may also collect information about how you use this 
	Site including your searches, the properties you look at, agents or developers you contact and the contents of the 
	emails you send to them. Finally, we may also collect information from any correspondence that you have with 
	us. 
	</p>
    <h3 class="legal_heading">Information collection and use</h3>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	Your information will enable us to provide you with access to all parts of this Site and to supply the services and 
	features that you have requested. We may aggregate the information to identify patterns which we can use in our 
	marketing and to help us develop, administer, support and improve our services and features.
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	We may use your information to contact you for your views on our services and to notify you occasionally about 
	important changes or developments to this Site or our services. Where you have consented, we might also use 
	your information to email you with details about any other products or services which we offer which may be of 
	interest to you. If you change your mind about being contacted in the future, please email us 
	at <a href="mailto:support@daft.ie">support@daft.ie</a> and tell us. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	The following features, by their nature, require and make use of personally identifiable information. 
	</p>
	
    <h3 class="legal_heading">Sending emails</h3>
    <p class="gc_content_par">
	The information that you complete on the 'Email Advertiser' forms on this Site is recorded by us and is sent to the 
	advertiser that you wish to contact. This helps them provide you with a more personalised service.  
	</p>

    <h3 class="legal_heading">Email a Friend</h3>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	When you use the 'email a friend' feature of this Site we record which properties you have sent to the friend, 
	solely so that we can track the popularity of those properties. We record the other details provided in the email for 
	internal monitoring of the service. We will not add any information collected in this manner to our mailing lists to 
	protect you and the recipient's privacy. 
	</p>

    <h3 class="legal_heading">Registering with us</h3>
	<p class="gc_content_par">	
	You do not need to register with us to visit our web pages.  If you do register with us, we save the details you 
	provide and use them to enable us to personalise the service we offer to you. You can update your details at any 
	time via the site.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="access">Who has access to the information you provide or we collect?</h2>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	We retain access to all personal information that we have collected from you. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	If you have consented on signup or the appropriate email form, we may provide any of the information we collect 
	to carefully screened third parties to contact you regarding products or services that we think may be of interest 
	to you. If you change your mind about being contacted by these third parties in the future, please email us at 
	<a href="mailto:support@daft.ie">support@daft.ie</a> and tell us. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	If our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your 
	information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	We will not otherwise disclose, sell or distribute your information to any third party without your permission unless 
	we are required to do so by law. 
	</p>
	<h3 class="legal_heading">Access to, changing or removing the information we hold</h3>
    <p class="gc_content_par">
	Registered users of this Site can update their information, change settings or cancel their membership on their 
	page once signed in. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	Non-registered and registered users of this Site can request we provide them with a copy of the personally 
	identifiable information we hold via <a href="mailto:support@daft.ie">support@daft.ie</a>. You may ask us to make any necessary changes to 
	ensure that such information is accurate and kept up-to-date. We may charge a small administration fee to cover 
	the data search, preparation and delivery. 
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="cookies">Cookies and tracking</h2>
	<p class="gc_content_par">Like many websites, we use "cookies" to enable us to personalise your visits to this website, simplify the signing-in procedure, keep track of your preferences and to track the usage of this website. Cookies are small pieces of 
	information that are stored in the hard drive of your computer by your browser. Your browser will have the option 
	to prevent websites using cookies (your browser's help screen or manual will tell you how to do this), but please 
	note that this may reduce the functionality of this Site and other websites. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	Like all websites, our servers automatically record 'log files' containing information about the volume and 
	characteristics of our website traffic e.g. IP address, numbers of pages viewed, length of time spent on site. We 
	use log files to build pictures of how our site is used that help us to monitor and improve the service. We cannot 
	identify you from your log files. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	We also use third party advertisements to support our site.  Some of these advertisers may use technology 
	such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such 
	as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser 
	you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used for 
	geotargeting purposes (showing France property adverts to someone in Paris, for example) or showing certain 
	ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). 
	</p>
    <h3 class="legal_heading">DoubleClick DART cookies</h3>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google?s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your 
	computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google 
	AdSense advertisements).  This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest based 
	targeting").  The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have 
	been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-
	related site, such as on a site about hockey).  DART uses "non personally identifiable information".  It does NOT 
	track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, 
	social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.  You can opt-out of this ad serving on all 
	sites using this advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a> 
	</p>
    <h3 class="legal_heading">Security, storage and transfer of information</h3>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	We follow strict security procedures to ensure that your personal information is not damaged, destroyed, or 
	disclosed to a third party without your permission (unless they are providing services as outlined in the 'who has 
	access to your information' section above) and to prevent unauthorised access to it. The computers that store the 
	information are kept in a secure facility with restricted physical access and we use secure firewalls and other 
	measures to restrict electronic access. If we are working with third parties we will require them to have in place 
	similar measures to protect your information. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	All of the information we collect or record is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need the information to 
	perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. We will explicitly ask you when 
	we need information to identify you. We may require you to co-operate with our security checks before we 
	disclose information to you. You can update the personal information that you give us at any time by viewing your 
	details page. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	We will retain your information for a reasonable period or for as long as is required by law. 
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="antispam">Anti-Spam Policy</h2> 
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	This Anti-Spam Policy Notice governs the use of the web page at and its associated services, web pages, 
	domains and sub-domains, which are owned and operated by Daft.  The Site should not be used as a 
	database for direct marketing by phone or SMS messaging. The personal contact details contained in 
	the placements on this site are for the sole purpose of letting or selling a property and should not be 
	used for any other purpose. It is an offence to send unsolicited direct marketing text messages or 
	make unsolicited marketing phone calls.  Each such call or message may be punished by a fine of up 
	to €5000. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	We consider spamming to be any activity whereby you directly or indirectly transmit email messages to any email 
	address that has not solicited such email and does not consent to such transmission. We also consider spamming to constitute posting advertisements that are off topic, or in discussion forums that do not specifically 
	permit advertisements. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	We reserve the right to terminate your account if we deem you to be in violation of our anti-spamming policies. 
	We also reserve the right to suspend your account pending review upon receipt of any complaint or other 
	evidence that you may be engaging in any spamming activity. 
	</p>
	<p class="gc_content_par">
	If you are "spammed" by any products, services, website, or any other matters, please report this activity to
