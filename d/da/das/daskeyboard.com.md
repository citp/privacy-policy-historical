If you visit our site again to take advantage of our services, it will automatically recognize that you have already been with us and what inputs and settings you have made, so you do not have to re-enter them.

### Website analysis

For purposes of analyzing and optimizing our websites, we use various services, which are presented below. For example, we can analyze how many people visit our site, which information is most in demand, or how people find it. Among other things, we collect data on which website an affected person came to a website (so-called referrer), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for which length of stay a subpage was viewed. This helps us to design and improve our offers in a user-friendly way. The data collected is not intended to personally identify individual users. Anonymous or at most pseudonymous data are collected.The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 f of the GDPR.

### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc, (1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). Usage includes the Universal Analytics operating mode. This makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID, thus analyzing the activities of a user across devices.

## 6\. Newsletter

For the continuous information of customers and potential customers we offer a regular free newsletter about our current offers.

With your consent within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 a DS-G VO you can register for the newsletter and subscribe to it. Here we use the so-called double-opt-in procedure:

This means that in a first step you will decide to receive the newsletter ('Sign up for our newsletter' or 'Subscribe now to our newsletter') and register with an email address.

In the second step, you will receive an email directly to the registered email address after registration, in which you will be asked to expressly confirm the shipping request of the newsletter, via a dedicated confirmation link.

After your confirmation save as your email address, this exclusively for the dispatch of the Newsletter. Legal basis for this is the granted consent to the storage acc. Art. 6 (1) a DS-GVO. If an acknowledgment in the above sense does not come in direct temporal connection with the registration in the first step, your email address will not be saved.

If you no longer wish to receive the newsletter, you can withdraw your consent at any time and unsubscribe from the newsletter. The revocation can either click on the reproached in each newsletter Email host link, through an email to [info@daskeyboard.com](mailto:info@daskeyboard.com) or by contacting the Privacy Officer named in this Privacy Policy.

## 7\. Info Email '5 Meta Hacks of the Week'

At <https://www.daskeyboard.com/5-meta-hacks/>, we also offer you the chance to sign up for a weekly informative email about the top five hacks (productive apps, life hacks, etc.),

With your consent within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 a DS-GVO you can register for the receipt of the e- mail and subscribe to it. Here too we use the so-called double opt-in procedure:

This means that you decide in a first step to receive this information email ('Sign up') and sign up with an email address.

In the second step you will receive an email directly to the registered email address, after which you will be asked to confirm the dispatch request. This is done via a dedicated confirmation link.

After your confirmation save as your email address, this also only for the sending of such an info email . Legal basis for this is the granted consent to the storage acc. Art. 6 (1) a DS-GVO. If an acknowledgment in the above sense does not come in direct temporal connection with the registration in the first step, your email address will not be saved.

Again, no transfer of data to third parties. The data are used exclusively for sending the information email.

If you no longer wish to send this info email, you can always revoke the appropriate consent and thereby unsubscribe. The revocation can either by clicking on the posted in each email staging link, an email to [info@daskeyboard.com](mailto:info@daskeyboard.com) or by contacting the Privacy Officer named in this Privacy Policy .

If the consent is revoked, the previously stored email address will be deleted immediately. Storage is therefore only as long as subscribed to the newsletter.

## 8\. Privacy Policy for the use of MailChimp

The newsletter and the '5 Meta Hacks of the Week' email are sent via MailChimp, a mailing list delivery platform owned by Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE # 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA,

The email addresses of our Newsletter recipients, as well as their other information described in these notes, are stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA.

MailChimp uses this information to send and evaluate the newsletters on our behalf. Furthermore, MailChimp may, according to its own information, use this data for the purpose of optimizing or improving its own services, for example for the technical optimization of shipping and the presentation of newsletters or for economic purposes in order to determine from which countries the recipients come. However, MailChimp does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write them down or to pass them on to third parties.

The privacy policy of MailChimp can be found here: <https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy>

### Statistical survey and analyzes

The newsletters contain a so-called 'web-beacon', ie a pixel-sized file which is retrieved from the MailChimp server when the newsletter is opened. This call will initially collect technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval. This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times.

Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters will be opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our desire nor that of MailChimp to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.

## 9\. Blog

On our website we also offer a blog at <https://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/>. We publish regularly different contributions to topics around our business fields.

Thereby a commentary function is provided in this blog, over which you can make public comments on the blogged topics. Your comment will be published together with your specified username in direct relation to the post.

We recommend that you use a pseudonym instead of your plain name when using this comment function. The username and email address is required, the further information to the 'website' is voluntary. When submitting a comment, only the name used and, if applicable, the voluntarily supplemented website information are published. A publication of your specified email address does not occur.

Our blog uses the DISQUS, a user-forum and commenting application provided by Disqus Inc., 301 Howard St., Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA (hereafter referred to as 'Disqus').

Disqus is an interactive commenting system that allows the registered user to comment on any website using Disqus with just one login. Disqus allows you to log in via existing accounts on Facebook (via Facebook Connect), Twitter and Google+. When you sign in through your Facebook, Twitter, Google + account, these providers may also collect, store and use data. Details can be found in the privacy policy of the respective provider. The use of the commenting function is also possible as a 'guest' without registration. However, then some functions are not available.

In addition to the comment text, Disqus also transmits your email address and IP address to us. We need the comment text to publish it. We only need the other information for the purpose of contacting you in connection with your use of DISQUS, for example, if we have queries about your user comments or to avoid liability and misuse. In order to avoid liability for comment content, it may also be necessary for us to delete comments, exclude them from publication or, as a milder measure and with appropriate labeling, to process.

DISQUS 'Terms of Use and Privacy Notice apply to the collection, processing and use of data by DISQUS and to your rights in this regard, available at <http://docs.disqus.com/help/30/> and <http://docs.disqus.com/help/29/>.

The legal basis for storing the email address as well as for the IP address is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DS-GMO.

We do not review submitted comments prior to publication and reserve the right to delete comments if they are objected to by third parties as unlawful.
