            <p class="underline"><b><u>"OPT-IN" and "OPT-OUT" Provisions.</u></b></p> 
        <blockquote>
            <p>There may be occasions when a subscriber will be presented with
              special offers either from the operators of the Site or from third-party
              service or content providers, which may include consent to receive e-mail
              solicitations, communications, newsletters, commercial advertising, or other
              promotional or special event materials (collectively referred to as "Offers").
              </p> 
            <p><b>" OPT-IN"</b> -- Some Offers may be presented to the subscriber with
              the option to express the subscriber's preference by either clicking or
              entering "accept" (alternatively "yes") or "decline" (alternatively "no"). By
              selecting or clicking the "accept" or "yes" the subscriber indicates that the
              subscriber "OPTS-IN" to that Offer and thereby agrees and assents that the
              subscriber's personal information and data may be disclosed to third-parties.
              </p> 
            <p><b>" OPT-OUT"</b> -- Other Offers may be presented with a pre-selected
              preference or choice. If the subscriber does not deselect the pre-selected
              preference of choice (i.e. "OPT-OUT" of the Offer) then the Site may transfer
              the subscriber's personal profile information to the third-party service or
              content provider making the Offer. If the subscriber deselects the pre-selected
              preference then no personal information about the subscriber may be disclosed
              to any third-party service or content provider.</p> 
        </blockquote>
            <p class="underline"><u><b>"OPT-OUT" Revocation Procedure.</b></u></p> 
        <blockquote>
            <p>The Site also offers all subscribers a procedure for
              "Opting-Out" if the subscriber subsequently chooses to revoke any consent to
              receive Offers by <a href="/?s=settings&amp;p=2">clicking here</a> and deselecting
          "I want to be informed of promotional offers".</p> 
        </blockquote>

            <p class="underline"><u><b>Terms and Conditions of Membership.</b></u></p> 
        <blockquote>
            <p>Each subscriber should carefully read each of the terms and
              conditions of Membership of this Site. By accepting membership to this Site you
              are unconditionally accepting all of those terms and conditions. Some of those
              terms and conditions may also affect the right of this Site to use information
              that it has gathered from subscribers.</p>
