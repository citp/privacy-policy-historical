# Privacy Policy | DataScience+

Your privacy is critically important to us. At DataSciencePlus.com we have a few fundamental principles:

  1. We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  2. We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  3. We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.



### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.

We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer).
