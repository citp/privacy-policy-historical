### The Information We Collect 

When you visit the TCI Websites, we or our vendors collect information, including PII that you provide, in order to provide you with the products and services you requested or with offers or promotions that may interest you, service your accounts, and save you time and better respond to your needs. 

We use cookie technology to collect website statistical information and to improve your customer experience with the TCI websites. Cookies set by TCI do not capture any PII. However, if you choose to furnish us with PII, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie to further enhance your experience with our websites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our websites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our websites), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our websites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. 

When browsing the TCI websites, you may choose not to provide us with any PII, such as by choosing not to register or to login. When you browse in this way, we will not link your cookie information with the account(s) you may have with TCI. 

We or our vendors also automatically collect some statistical data as you browse our websites. For example, we automatically collect your IP Address used to connect your computer to the Internet, browser type and version, operating system and platform, average time spent on our websites, pages viewed, information searched for, access times, Clickstream Data, and other relevant information about your online experience. 

TCI may also use web beacons to present offers on the TCI Websites, or other websites on which TCI advertises. In addition, e-mail offers that we send you may contain Web Beacons to help us record response rates, assist in measuring the offer's effectiveness, and/or generally enhance the relevance of e-mail offers. We sometimes use vendors to manage web beacons and the data they collect; however, web beacons do not capture any PII that you enter on the TCI Websites. 

We or our vendor also collect information, including PII, that you provide via telephone, traditional mail, e-mail, in person, or otherwise. 

At some TCI Websites and through certain promotions, you can submit information, including PII, about other people. For example, if you order a gift online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, we might collect the recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. 

### How We Use and Share The Information We Collect 

TCI uses the information we or our vendors collect about you and others, including PII, to complete transactions, respond to your requests, deliver the products and services in which you enroll or request, and notify you of updates, products, services, offers, or promotions that may interest you. We may process or combine your information with other information that is publicly available. This enables us to customize your customer experience and provide you with more relevant offers. TCI may also use the information that we or our vendors collect from you online and via other means to market to you through alternative channels. 

TCI may share your information within our Tabor Communication, Inc family of companies. To provide products and services to you or offers that may interest you, we may also share your information with carefully selected vendors with whom we work. This includes companies that manage accounts and companies that perform marketing services and other business operations for us. All companies that act on our behalf are required to safeguard PII. 

TCI may share your information with business partners carefully selected by us that may wish to offer you products or services that may interest you, either in conjunction with TCI or by themselves. 

We may also use or disclose your information, including PII, to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process, or as otherwise permitted by law; to report or collect debts owed; to reduce fraud or criminal activity; to protect the legal rights of TCI, our customers, our Websites, or the users of our Websites; or to allow a purchaser of a TCI division, or TCI as a whole, to continue using your information to serve you or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Statement. 

Regarding Tabor Research studies: Data collected for market research or other studies will be used only in aggregate; no data linking respondents to specific study answers will be released. Respondent PII will not be released without specific prior permission. Respondents also have the option of identifying their organization either by name, or organization type (e.g. Large Product Manufacturer). PII information will be used to send respondants rewards, and/or study summary results as appropriate. 

### Using Your E-Mail Address 

We may use your e-mail address for the following types of e-mail messages:

### Advertisements That Link to Our Websites 

TCI hires vendors to place advertisements on the TCI Websites and our banner advertisements on other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting activities on the TCI Websites and other websites. This enables us to learn which advertisements and websites bring users to our Websites and to improve the user experience. Cookies are used to assist with these activities. In doing so, a unique cookie is placed on your computer either by us or a vendor in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement. 

This Privacy Statement does not cover any use of information that such vendors may have collected from you or the methods used by them to collect that information. Rather, such vendors have their own privacy policies. If you would like more information about their privacy policies, including information on how to opt out of their tracking methods, please contact those sites directly. 

### Transfers of Information to Other Countries 

Some of the uses and disclosures mentioned in this Privacy Statement may involve the transfer of your PII to various countries around the world. By submitting your PII to TCI via a TCI Website or otherwise, you consent to such transfers. 

### YOUR COMMUNICATION AND PRIVACY CHOICES
