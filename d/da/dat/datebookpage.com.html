<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #333333;">CPX Interactive is an advertising network that may deliver advertisements to the Web sites you visit. CPX Interactive understands that your online privacy is important to you. We have created the following Privacy and Data Use Policy (the “Policy”) to let you know what information we collect on this Web site and when we serve advertisements on our network of Web sites owned by third-party publishers (collectively, the "CPX Interactive Site Network"), how such information is used, and how it is shared with third parties if shared at all. </span></p>
<p class="bold"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Please read this Policy carefully. Use of the CPX Interactive Site Network, this Web site and your sharing of information with us is subject to the terms and conditions of this Policy. By using the CPX Interactive Site Network, this Web site or sharing information with us, you give your agreement to this Policy. The Policy may be revised or updated at any time by us as further described below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #333333;">The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the Web site visitor or consumer. The terms "CPX Interactive," "we," "us," and "our" refer to CPX Interactive, and the companies under its control (such as subsidiaries), or under common control (such as parent companies, or companies owned by its parent company) (collectively, “CPX Interactive Entities”).</span></p>

<p><span class="bold1"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Ad Delivery &amp; Reporting Across Multiple Sites</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #333333;"><br> As part of our ad delivery and reporting, we log page views and collect information for the purpose of delivering ads or providing advertising-related services, including providing a specific advertisement based on a particular type of browser or time of day; statistical reporting in connection with the activity on a Web site; and tracking the number of ads served on a particular day to a particular Web site. To do so, we collect information about the type of browser and operating system of Web site visitors, as well as the domain name, day and time of visit, and page(s) visited. We do so across multiple Web domains owned or operated by different entities (each, a "Site").</span></p>
<p><span class="bold1"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Relevant Advertising</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #333333;"><br> We want to deliver more relevant advertising to you. Delivering more relevant advertising to you and other Web site visitors allows Web site owners to generate more advertising revenue. This revenue pays for the free content that they may publish for you, or free services that they may deliver to you. It also means that you are more likely to see online advertising that meets your interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #333333;">In an effort to deliver relevant advertising to you, we collect data across multiple Web domains owned or operated by different entities to categorize likely consumer interest segments for use in advertising online ("Online Behavioral Advertising" or "OBA"). For example, we can analyze aggregate, anonymous data to determine that a visitor of a particular Site at 6:30PM is more likely to be interested in Pizza, or antique cars, or a classic movie. We can then serve an ad to the Web page the visitor is viewing that offers a discounted Pizza, car show tickets, or classic movie DVD-importantly-without ever knowing the identity or personal information of the visitor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #333333;">If you do not wish to benefit from relevant advertising, please feel free opt out OBA as described in the paragraph titled “OBA Opt-Out”, below.</span></p>

Cookies are used to facilitate Web site navigation (for example, so your bank knows that you logged in), make sure that you are forwarded to the appropriate Web site when you click on an ad, and generally improve your Web browsing experience. Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a Web browser, and to limit the number of times a Web browser receives any one advertisement. We also use cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display.

While we generally will use such information only for the purpose that it was intended, we reserve the right to use and share such information under these terms.<span> </span></span></p>

The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this Policy. </span></p>

<p class="headblue"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #ff6600;">Data Retention</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #333333;">Your Internet browser stores OBA-related data as cookies. If you have cookies disabled, if you delete your cookies, or if other software deletes the cookies used for that data storage, such data is lost because it is not retained separately by CPX Interactive. The cookies that store data related to CPX Interactive’s OBA will in any case expire one year after the last time such information is stored, barring any technical malfunction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #333333;">CPX Interactive retains information regarding ad delivery (see, “Ad Delivery &amp; Reporting” above) for up to six (6) months. However, CPX Interactive may retain aggregate statistics, reports and summaries regarding ad delivery for a longer period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #333333;">CPX Interactive may delete any or all of OBA or information regarding ad delivery that relates to you at any time and in CPX Interactive’s sole discretion, notwithstanding its normal data retention policies. Further, CPX Interactive reserves the right to retain and use any information described in this Policy as reasonably necessary to comply with laws or regulations, notwithstanding any limitations described in this Policy to the contrary. If CPX Interactive changes its retention data policies by updating this Policy, its new policies will apply to all data then retained by CPX Interactive.</span></p>

We attempt to process all unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion. However, after unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another mailing from us because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing list that you have subscribed into.

These rules differ significantly from the laws of the United States of America (“US”).

By providing information to us, you acknowledge that we operate in the US and you agree to (i) permit us to transmit and use your user information anywhere necessary, including across international boundaries, to better improve the services and transactions provided by CPX Interactive; and (ii) that such use by us shall be subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Policy and our Terms of Use. </span></p>

We routinely evaluate our practices to identify security threats or opportunities for the improvement of our services. No transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure.

When we do, we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date (found at the bottom) so that you have a way to always become aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. For changes to this Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of information you have already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent (if we have the necessary contact information) before implementing such revisions with respect to such information, or notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our Web site or by directly sending you a notification. For all other changes, it is your responsibility to review this Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often. </span></p>
