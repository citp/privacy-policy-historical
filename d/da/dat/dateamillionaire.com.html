    <blockquote>
                <p>
            The subscriber expressly agrees that the Site may use any personal information
            that has been provided by the subscriber or that has been collected by the Site
            about the subscriber for any purpose, including without limitation, technical,

            authorized to use the information by the Site. We do not rent, sell, or share
            your email address with outside parties. <br> <br>

        By the subscriber's use of the Site, the subscriber expressly
            agrees that the Site may use any of the personal information about subscribers
            that it has gathered or collected to provide them with offers to other sites or
            products that may or may not be of interest. <br> <br>

        Please note that personal information about a subscriber may be
            collected by a third-party web service provider that has an advertising banner
            or link on the Site. <br> <br>

        The Site is not responsible or liable for the use of any

    <p style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>"OPT-IN" and "OPT-OUT" Provisions.</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>There may be occasions when a subscriber will be presented with
            special offers either from the operators of the Site or from third-party
            service or content providers, which may include consent to receive e-mail
            solicitations, communications, newsletters, commercial advertising, or other
            promotional or special event materials (collectively referred to as "Offers").
        <br> <br>

        <strong>"OPT-IN"</strong> -- Some Offers may be presented to the subscriber with
            the option to express the subscriber's preference by either clicking or
            entering "accept" (alternatively "yes") or "decline" (alternatively "no"). By
            selecting or clicking the "accept" or "yes" the subscriber indicates that the
            subscriber "OPTS-IN" to that Offer and thereby agrees and assents that the
            subscriber's personal information and data may be disclosed to third-parties.
        <br> <br>

        <strong>"OPT-OUT"</strong> -- Other Offers may be presented with a pre-selected
            preference or choice. If the subscriber does not deselect the pre-selected
            preference of choice (i.e. "OPT-OUT" of the Offer) then the Site may transfer
            the subscriber's personal profile information to the third-party service or
            content provider making the Offer. If the subscriber deselects the pre-selected
            preference then no personal information about the subscriber may be disclosed
            to any third-party service or content provider.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>"OPT-OUT" Revocation Procedure.</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
                <p>
            The Site also offers all subscribers a procedure for
            "Opting-Out" if the subscriber subsequently chooses to revoke any consent to
            receive Offers by             <a href="settings/2">clicking here</a>
             and deselecting
            "I want to be informed of promotional offers".        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Terms and Conditions of Membership.</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
                <p>
            Each subscriber should carefully read each of the terms and
            conditions of Membership of this Site. By accepting membership to this Site you
