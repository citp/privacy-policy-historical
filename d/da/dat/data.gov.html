<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
Data.gov is committed to protecting the privacy and security of visitors 
to this website. Data.gov does not collect personal information when you 
visit our website unless you choose to provide that information.  Outlined 
below is the Data.gov online privacy policy. If you have questions about 
this policy, 
<a href="/contact">please let us know</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Information Collected and Stored Automatically
		</h2>
<div class="indented">

<p>
When you visit Data.gov, we may store some or all of the following: the 
Internet address from which you access Data.gov, date and time, the Internet 
address of the website from which you linked to Data.gov, the name of the 
file or words you searched, items clicked on a page, and the browser and 
operating system used.
</p>
<p>
This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various 
sections of our site and identify system performance or problem areas. We 
also use this information to help us develop the site, analyze patterns of 
usage, and to make the site more useful. This information is not used for 
associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. 
Data.gov periodically deletes its Web logs. On occasion, Data.gov may provide 
this information to third party entities it contracts with for the purposes 
of research analysis.
</p>
		</div>
<h2>
Cookies
		</h2>
<div class="indented">

<p>
When you visit some websites, their web servers generate pieces of information 
known as cookies. Cookies are commonly used to recognize your computer in the future.
</p>
<p>
Data.gov uses per-session cookies to serve technical purposes, like providing 
seamless navigation through Data.gov. These cookies do not permanently record 
data and they are not stored on your computer’s hard drive. Data.gov’s 
session cookies are available only during an active browser session. 
When you close your browser, the session cookie disappears.
</p>
<p>
Data.gov also uses persistent cookies to be able to track the number of unique visitors to the site.
</p>
<p>
Users can choose to disable cookies using their web browsers.  It will not 
affect their ability to search for, review and retrieve data on the site.
</p>
		</div>
<h2>
Personal Information
		</h2>
<div class="indented">

<p>
Users are NOT required to provide any information to search, retrieve, download, 
filter and otherwise use the data available on Data.gov.  There are some optional 
uses of Data.gov that require a user account.  They include participation in some 
Data.gov Communities, commenting on blog posts or datasets, suggesting datasets, 
and saving specific views created by the user on the Data.gov platform.  If you 
choose to use these options, you need to create a user account by providing an 
email address and user name.  Email addresses are not made public  and are
used for authentication only. 
If you choose to provide us with personal 
information—like filling out a <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> form 
with an email address and submitting it to us through the website—we 
use that information to respond to your message, and to help get you the 
information you requested. 
Your email address will not be stored or retrieved by Data.gov. 
We only share the information you give us with 
another government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as 
otherwise required by law. Data.gov never collects information or creates 
individual profiles for commercial marketing.
</p>
<p>
While you must provide an email address and user name for the optional uses of Data.gov, 
you should NOT include any other personal 
information, especially 
<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html#protect">Social Security numbers</a>.
</p>
<p>
Data.gov is NOT a Privacy Act System of Record.  Submission of any information is 
voluntary, and the collection of email addresses is being done purely for the purpose of authentication.
</p>
		</div>
<h2>
User Profiles and Online Comments
		</h2>
<div class="indented">

<p>
Users creating accounts can pick any user name.  It does not have to be the user’s 
real name or email address.  Users have the option of uploading additional information 
such as an image, location, tags, and other social profiles.  Providing additional information is entirely voluntary.
</p>
<p>
Any comments you provide are categorized as public information. Compilations 
of your comments may be provided to national leaders (without email address) 
and other individuals participating in Data.gov efforts. Comments may also be 
made available online to the public without the use of any optionally provided 
email addresses, but with the user name.
</p>
		</div>
<h2>
Browser Information Collected on the Website
		</h2>
<div class="indented">

<p>
Ratings of datasets are collected to track the usefulness of certain datasets 
and improve the value of Data.gov. Data.gov does not gather, request, record, 
require, collect or track any Internet users’ personal information 
through these processes.
</p>
		</div>
<h2>
Site Security
		</h2>
<div class="indented">

<p>
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available 
to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software 
programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to 
upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
</p>
<p>
Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are 
made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are 
used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in 
accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.
</p>
<p>
Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this 
service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer 
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure 
Protection Act. 
</p>
<p>
A variety of physical, electronic and procedural safeguards are maintained 
to protect information. For example, commercially reasonable tools and 
techniques are used to protect against unauthorized access to Data.gov 
systems. Data.gov has been Certified and Accredited (C&amp;A) by the General 
Services Administration (GSA). Also, access to email received is restricted 
to those who need such access in the course of their duties for Data.gov.
</p>
		</div>
<h2>
External Links
		</h2>
<div class="indented">

<p>
Data.gov may contain links to websites created and maintained by other 
public and/or private organizations. Data.gov provides these links as a 
service to our users. When users link to an outside website, they are leaving 
the Data.gov site and are subject to the privacy and security policies of 
the owners/sponsors of the outside website(s). You are encouraged to 
familiarize yourself with these policies. The Data.gov linking policy 
is the same as the 
<a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/Linking_Policy.shtml">USA.gov Linking Policy</a>.
</p>
		</div>
<h2>
Children’s Privacy
		</h2>
<div class="indented">

<p>
Data.gov complies with the 
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998</a> 
(COPPA) that helps to protect the safety and privacy of children online. 
COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation constitute United States Federal 
law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. Personal 
information from children under 13 is not knowingly collected, nor are 
children under 13 knowingly contacted by Data.gov. Data.gov does not intend 
to solicit information of any kind from children under 13. It is possible 
that Data.gov may receive emails pertaining to children under 13. If 
Data.gov is notified of this, as soon as the information is verified, 
parental consent will be immediately obtained or the email will be deleted 
from the email box servicing Data.gov.
</p>
		</div>
<h2>
Prohibitions
		</h2>
<div class="indented">

<p>
Data.gov will not link to any website that exhibits hate, bias, or 
discrimination. Data.gov reserves the right to deny or remove any link that 
contains misleading information or unsubstantiated claims, or is determined 
to be in conflict with Data.gov’s policies.
</p>
		</div>
<h2>

pointers to information created and maintained by other public and/or private
