We record IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer)
      to track sessions on our site. Tracking gives us an idea of which parts
      and pages of our site users are visiting, how often they visit them, and
      how long they spend there. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally
      identifiable. This means that even if your session is tracked, you still
      remain anonymous.
      
      <p>We also track browser type and platform. We use this
          information to deliver customized information specific to a particular
          platform and to determine the "mix" of browser types accessing
          our site. This information helps us make our site operate correctly
        with your browser.</p>
      <p>However, if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Purchase a product from DataViz</li>
        <li>Register a new product</li>
        <li>Download a trial version of our software</li>
        <li>Sign up for a mailing list or enter
            a contest</li>
        <li>Fill out a survey, or sign onto a page that requires authorization</li>
        <li>Or
            enter into any other transaction with us,</li>
      </ul>      
      <p> You may be asked to provide us your name, e-mail address, phone number,
        fax number, postal address, credit card number (for purchases), and possibly
        other personal information. Additional demographic information may be
        optionally requested in order to improve our service to our customers.
        We may use the information you provide to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep you informed of new releases of our products</li>
        <li>Provide helpful
        hints and tips on how to use our products</li>
        <li>Make special offers that we
        extend only to our registered customers.</li>
        <li>Improve our site and the services
          we offer you.</li>
        <li>In limited cases, we may share your registration information
            (name, address, etc.) with the manufacturer of a product you purchase
            from us -- but only when we inform you in advance of your purchase
            of the particular product.</li>
      </ul>      <p>In addition, in version 5.0 of Documents To Go and version 2.0 of Passwords Plus, DataViz may gather some information concerning the way in which our products or services are used.  This can be turned off in the Settings under Analytics. For example, in Documents To Go:  We track the different file types (e.g., Word vs. Excel vs. PowerPoint vs. PDF) that our customer are opening.  We also look at how long users are in a given document as well as whether or not users are viewing or editing documents. For example, in Passwords Plus:  we track whether or not our provided record templates and categories are being used. This helps us to better understand how to improve our products and services, as well as where to focus future development efforts. In Crowdcast 1.0, we anonymously track how often songs are voted up and down, and from where songs are voted up and down, to gain a better understanding of what voting options to provide in future product updates. </p>
      <p>We may use third parties for tools or analytical software to automatically collect and use certain anonymous data that does not directly enable us to identify you. The types of anonymous data that DataViz may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to unique device identifier or other device identifier ("UDID"); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as zip code, area code and location; and (v) other anonymous data to help us enhance our products and services.</p>
      <p>The analytics software may provide information about how you use your mobile applications as well as how applications are performing across different handsets. The third parties obtain this information as a result of data being sent to their servers from our software "agent" if embedded in your mobile application. The data collected by the agent may include: agent version, platform, SDK version, timestamp, API key (identifier for application), application version, device identifier, iOS Identifier for Advertising, iOS Identifier for Vendors, Media Access Control (MAC) address, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), Model, manufacture and OS version of device, session start/stop time, locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), time zone, and network status (WiFi, etc.). It hashes iOS device identifiers, MAC address and IMEI; however, we do not hash platform device identifiers such as the iOS Identifier for Advertising, ANDROID_ID and the BB_PIN. Hashing involves the transformation of these identifiers into a value or key that represents the original identifier. The device identifiers (if applicable), IMEI (if applicable), MAC address (if applicable), and platform are hashed to a third party ID.</p>
      <p>In addition, our third parties may collect the following data: User ID (for your service), latitude and longitude (obfuscated by the third parties to state/city), gender, age, events, errors, and page views. Finally, we see your IP address, device type, locale and timezone through the HTTP request. Our third parties may use this data to enable demographic and customer-created segment advertising targeting, create reports for you to analyze you and to create reports and/or metrics against which we can compare with our user base. In addition, our third parties may provide us with the option of exporting raw third party data to our servers such as timestamp, platform, event, and user ID. We can also record errors that occur in your applications and receive an export of data containing the error information.</p>
