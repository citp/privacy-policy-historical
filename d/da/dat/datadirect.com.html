	<h1>Legal</h1><h2>DataDirect Technologies and Your
        Privacy</h2>

        <p><b>DataDirect and Your Privacy<br></b> Your right to
        privacy is very important to DataDirect. At DataDirect, we
        believe that the personal information you provide to us
        must be both kept confidential and used in a responsible
        fashion. We consistently strive to put our best efforts
        towards achieving both of these objectives.</p>

        <p><b>Types and Reasons for Data Collection<br></b> When
        you sign up for membership in SupportLink Online (Automated
        Case Reporting), Online Store, Product Evaluation Service
        or DataDirect's email news services including DataDirect
        Connections, ("DataDirect Services"), some personal
        information is required. This information is used for three
        primary purposes.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>To help you quickly find software, services or
          information on datadirect.com.</li>

          <li>To help us create Web site content most relevant to
          you.</li>

          <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers,
          updated information and other new services from
          DataDirect.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the personal information collected is used for a
        reason not listed above, including sharing this information
        with any third party, we will post our procedures on how we
        intend to use it before we do so. Further, if you tell us
        that you do not wish to have personal information used as a
        basis for contacting you, we will respect your wishes and,
        to the best of our abilities, remove or block access to
        that information. Additionally, you may always cancel your
        membership at any time.</p>

        <p><b>Explicit Member Signup Information<br></b> Explicit
        member signup information includes information collected
        during initial registration to DataDirect Services, as well
        as any additional information provided to gain access to
        special services or features. These special services may
        include software downloads, special discount offers, Beta
        program participation, email newsletters and more.</p>

        <p>This information is used by DataDirect solely to inform
        you of new services and programs or to help you in
        conducting an evaluation of a DataDirect product. In
        addition, in an aggregate form, your information is also
        used to improve the value of this web site. We may provide
        this information to other organizations within DataDirect
        when needed to support and deliver specialized services. In
        limited circumstances, DataDirect may share your
        information with authorized third parties providing
        services on our behalf. The information we share with third
        parties will only be used for the purposes stated above.
        You may view the privacy policies of these third parties by
        going to their websites, some of which are available
        through the "Contact Us" section of the DataDirect website
        and clicking on "List of Current Resellers &amp;

        Distributors." We may also release personally identifying
        information when necessary to comply with state and federal
        laws. In such a case, we will do our best to notify you of
        any such release by contacting you through e-mail or by
        letter, if we are able to.</p>

        <p><b>Web Site Traffic and Analysis<br></b> DataDirect
        gathers and analyzes information from our visitors' routine
        use of the web site. We use this information to monitor
        what areas of the site are most active, and to help focus
        our continuing development efforts. Only generalized,
        aggregate information is shared with other organizations
        within DataDirect; an individual user's traffic patterns
        are strictly confidential.</p>

        <p><b>Access to Information Collected<br></b> As a member
        of any of DataDirect Services, you can simply and easily
        update your membership information at any time.
        Additionally, it should be noted that within your
        DataDirect services profile you can control whether you
        wish to receive informational e-mails from DataDirect.</p>

        <p><b>User Preferences, Opt Out<br></b> Membership in
        DataDirect Services is completely voluntary. If at any time
        you wish to leave the program, simply notify us via e-mail
        and we will promptly cancel your membership. We will also
        pass this information request on to authorized third
        parties acting on our behalf, but we are not responsible
        for the ultimate actions of these parties.</p>

        <p>Some DataDirect Services require users to provide the
        information in the registration screens for reasons
        specified and as provided in the user registration
        agreement. This information is essential to properly
        service the membership. As greater functionality is added
        to the site, we will continue to strive to develop
        mechanisms and policies that best address participants'
        preferences related to information collection and use.</p>

        <p><b>Collection of Information Using "Cookies"<br></b>
        DataDirect Services use several cookies to provide you
        easier and more direct access to information and services.
        The use of these cookies is required for full access to
        DataDirect services. All information stored in these
        cookies is encrypted. Additionally, sensitive information,
        such as credit card numbers, is never stored in
        cookies.</p>

        <p><b>Links to Third Party Sites and Services (if
        applicable)<br></b> In order to process purchase orders,
        evaluate products, and inform you of upcoming events and
        new products, we may choose to have a third party transmit
        information to you on our behalf. These parties will only
        be authorized to transmit information on DataDirect's
        behalf and will not be authorized to use your information
        for their own benefit. In addition, we may periodically
        conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We
        encourage our customers to participate in these surveys
        because they provide us with important information. In all
        cases, your personal information and responses will remain
        strictly confidential, even if a third party conducts the
        survey. While we choose these providers carefully, it
        should be noted that the privacy policy for any third party
        collection or transmission service might differ from
        DataDirect's. Wherever possible, links to that party's
        privacy policy are provided and should be consulted.
        DataDirect is not responsible for the privacy practices of
        third parties.</p>

        <p><b>Security<br></b> DataDirect is concerned with the
        security of the personal data we collect and has put in
        place measures to prevent unauthorized access to that
        information. Payment information is protected by a Secure
        Sockets Layer (SSL) connection and, once stored, is
        protected through various security measures. These measures
        include both policies relating to access to information and
        technological elements such as firewalls etc. While we make
        every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our
        network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security
        measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally
        obtaining this information.</p>

        <p><b>Note to Parents and Minors<br></b> Please note that
        our website does not market to children. We do not want to
        collect any personal information from minors under any
        circumstances. We ask that minors (under age 18) refrain
        from using our site. Anyone using this Site or the Services
        warrants and promises that they are 18 years of age or
        older.</p>

        <p><b>Updates to the Privacy Policy<br></b> DataDirect is
        sensitive to user's privacy issues and recognizes the need
        to update this policy as new features and business services
        are offered on datadirect.com. DataDirect
        reserves the right to amend the privacy policy at any time
        with or without notice. Please check back frequently in the
        event of changes to our Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p><b>Last Update: November 4, 2002</b></p>

        <p>If you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices, please contact us at 301-468-8501 (US).</p>

        <p><b>Legal Notification<br>
        Feedback; Confidential Information; Privacy<br></b> Unless
        otherwise explicitly stated herein, any non-personal
        information or material sent to DataDirect will be deemed
        NOT to be confidential. By sending DataDirect any
        non-personal information or material, you grant DataDirect

        that you submitted materials or other information to us
        unless: (a) you grant us permission to do so; (b) we first
        notify you that the materials or other information you
