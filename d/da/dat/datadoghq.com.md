This Privacy Policy also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of personal information collected about you through our Services.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, fill out a form, pay for subscriptions, apply for a job, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, company name, postal address, phone number and any other information you choose to provide.

Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see “Your Choices” below.




Information We Collect from Other Sources

We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, if you create or log into your Datadog account using your Google Apps credentials via single sign-on, we will have access to certain information such as your name and email address as authorized in your Google Apps profile settings.

  * With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf only to the extent necessary to provide these services to us;

  * In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is permitted by, in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation or legal process such as to comply with a subpoena;

We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.

## Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others

We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and in applications. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by Datadog and Datadog service providers to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity. For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](https://www.aboutads.info/choices).

We may also work with other websites or platforms to serve ads to you as part of a customized campaign, unless you notify us that you prefer not to have information about you used in this way. To opt out, click [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) or if located in the European Union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.

## Information Collected on Behalf of Customers

In the case of personal information we handle or receive on behalf of a customer for our products and monitoring services (“Customer PI”), we have no direct relationship with the customer’s employees or other individuals with whom that customer may interact with respect to the Services. If you are such an employee or individual and are seeking access to, or would like to correct, amend or delete, Customer PI, you should direct your query to the applicable customer (but the foregoing will not limit EU individuals from requesting EU Data as provided below). We will respond within a reasonable timeframe to a customer’s request to remove Customer PI.

We will not use Customer PI except for the purpose of providing and supporting the Services for the applicable customer. Customer PI will be retained for as long as needed for that purpose and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

## Security

Datadog has implemented security measures to protect personal information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

## Transfer of Information to the U.S. and Other Countries

Datadog is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.

In connection with Datadog’s processing of personal data it receives in the U.S. from the European Union (“EU Data”), Datadog participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Datadog is committed to subjecting all EU Data, in reliance on the Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Framework, Datadog is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. For more information about the Principles, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome).

Without limiting the above, Datadog adheres to the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer. As noted in “Sharing of Information” above, we may transfer personal information (including EU Data) to our vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such EU Data to carry out work on our behalf. Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of those third-party service providers for their handling of EU Data that we transfer to them. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose EU Data in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

EU individuals have rights to access personal data about them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal data. If you believe Datadog holds EU Data about you, and wish to request access (or to limit use or disclosure) of such EU Data, you can submit a written request to the point of contact listed in the “Contact Us” section below. If the requested EU Data is Customer PI, please include the name of the applicable customer in your request; we will refer the request to that customer to respond directly to you and will support them as needed to respond to your request. We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe. You may also contact the customer directly as noted in the “Information Collected on Behalf of Customers” section above.

Please direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Principles to the point of contact listed in the “Contact Us” section below. If Datadog does not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to Datadog’s U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider and designated Privacy Shield dispute resolution provider here: <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>. Under certain conditions specified by the Principles and more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at <https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint>, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.
