## What are Cookies?

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Your browser’s help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by Dataplugs to track user preferences while the user is using our Services. They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies may be used by Dataplugs to store whether, for example, you want your password remembered or not, and other information. Cookies used on Dataplugs websites do not contain personally identifiable information.

## What is Log Files?

Like most standard websites, we use log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. However, none of the information stored in our log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to personally identifiable information.

## How we use the information we collect?

  


Dataplugs may from time to time engage third parties, including but not limited to, its own subsidiaries, affiliate companies, and business partners to preserve, analyze, store or manipulate information collected from Users on behalf of Dataplugs in connection with delivering Dataplugs services. In all such cases, such third party service providers or business partners will be required to treat all such information collected from Users, including Users personally identifiable data, with the same degree of care as Dataplugs and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy.

We may also use this information for research purposes regarding the effectiveness of our Services and marketing and sales efforts. Dataplugs will not in any way share this information with a third party either for free or by selling it, unless you specifically authorize such disclosures.

## Disclosure of Information

  


Dataplugs may also disclose aggregate, anonymous, data based on information collected from users to investors and potential partners.

Our customers and users will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and possibly a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.

## Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement, if, for instance, our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

## Legal Disclaimer

  


Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary and required to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Dataplugs.

The information provided to Dataplugs is saved indefinitely and may be stored on one or more databases directly or indirectly maintained by Dataplugs. Dataplugs employs industry standard security measures to protect the confidentiality of the information. 

While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur; we make every effort to prevent such occurrences.
