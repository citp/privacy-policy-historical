			How we gather information from users</strong></font></p>
			<p class="style2">
			<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How we 
			collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 
			the activities in which you elect to participate and the services 
			provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when 
			you register for access to certain portions of our site or request 
			certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. 
			You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and 
			contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas 
			of our site. Like most Web sites, our company also collects 
			information automatically and through the use of electronic tools 
			that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the 
			name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to 
			recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other 
			things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing 
			you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or 
			may control the number of times you encounter a particular 
			advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional 
			technology, we may also gather information through other means. In 
			certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, 
			for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but 
			if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site 
			or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may 
			not be able to customize the site’s features according to your 
			preferences.</font></p>

			What we do with the information we collect</strong></font></p>
			<p class="style2">
			<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like

			<p class="style2">
			<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
			Aggregated Information (information that does not personally 
			identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine 
			information about your usage patterns with similar information 
			obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services 
			(e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are 
			most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared 
			with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information 
			does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you 
			or allow anyone to identify you individually.</font></p>
			<p class="style2">
			<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may

			support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for 
			example) may access such information. We will use your information 
			only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we 
			continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner 
			with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user 
			information may be among the transferred assets. We may also 
			disclose your information in response to a court order, at other 
			times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in 
			connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or 
			to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
