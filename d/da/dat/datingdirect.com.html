                    <p>Meetic uphold the strictest of European and French standards with respect to protection of privacy and of personal information, and have made a notification to the French data protection authority (Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés - CNIL) under the no 796865, 802516 and 1107043. Our technical teams do their utmost to ensure the safety of our sites. Internet security is a complex issue and no system can be considered 100% secure. Should a security breach occur meetic.com will endeavour to act as fast as possible to remedy the problem.</p><p>Some information, comments or content (photographs or video) that the Member optionally provides may possibly, under the responsibility and on the initiative of the Member concerned, reveal the ethnic origin of the Member, his/her nationality, religion and/or sexual orientation. By providing such optional information, the Member concerned manifests his/her intention and, consequently, expressly consents to, and takes sole and exclusive responsibility for, the processing of this mentioned "sensitive" data by Meetic and the companies from the Meetic Group, comprising of any and all companies within which the Meetic company holds a participation, as well as their service providers located within and outside of the European Union (herein, the “Meetic Group”).</p><p>Each Member can access or request access to information concerning him/her in order to have it modified, deleted or to forbid any further use by Meetic. Members can submit such requests for access by mailing their requests to the following address: Meetic - CS 10002 - 75320 PARIS CEDEX 09 or by filling out the contact forms, and each Member shall carefully identify the sender's personal information. Similar rights granted by the other companies of the Meetic Group may be exercised through the “My account” section or by addressing directly to the relevant entity at its postal address.</p>
<p>With regards to the Meetic Affinity Test, the mandatory aspect of each answer will be specified for each question. The very nature of the Meetic Affinity Service requires a majority of answers in order to be effective.</p><p>Each Member can, at the time of registration or at any time thereafter, request to receive and, subsequently, request without charge via match.com to cease to receive, our newsletters and/or promotional offers sent to her/him by email or to mobile phone from the Meetic Group and/or its partners in accordance with the French Data Protection Act No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 as amended.</p>

                    <h2 class="i-color-main i-title-5">1. When and why do we gather information about you?</h2>
                    <p>The Member is asked to supply information about himself/herself when he/she registers with the Service, participates in a contest, responds to a survey, participates in a chat or acquires a subscription. Certain items of information are mandatory in order to gain access to Services.</p><p>We have the ability to retain your contact details should you input them on our website even if you do not complete your registration.</p><p>If you are looking for the information we collect about your computer and or device through our use of cookies; then please see our <a href="http://www.datingdirect.com/misc/cookie.php" class="i-color-main">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

                    <p>Personal information gathered by match.com can include your name, mailing and/or email address, fixed line and/or mobile telephone numbers, bank information, information about your physical appearance, photographs, voice recording, video, personal values, religion, interests, and your use of the Service.</p>

<p>Finally, the website operated by the Meetic Group may be using cookies, designed to store information used to identify the Member while he/she is browsing on our websites, in order to allow the Member to continue browsing without having to re-enter this information for each new page. The Member always has the option of preventing the use of cookies by modifying the options of his/her web browser.</p>
<p>Additional information may be found in our dedicated Cookie Policy.</p>

                    <h2 class="i-color-main i-title-5">3. Who has access to your information?</h2>
                    <p>The information gathered about you when you register with meetic.com, and subscribe to our Services is used to offer you our different Services. All precautions have been taken on our databases to archive your information in a secure environment. Only a small number of our employees have access to your information, which is only accessible in case of necessity. The personal information you provide at the time of registration which does not comprise your personal ad and your profile will not be accessible by third parties, nor passed on, sold or exchanged, except in the cases named below and subject to your prior information and agreement, or in assumption of your non opposition hereto. Processing implemented by other entities of the Meetic Group are subject to their specific privacy policies.</p>

<p>We may send you promotional offers from some of our partners, subject to your explicit and informed consent given during registration, unless you choose not to be contacted during your registration or unless you change your mind at any moment thereafter. If you do not wish to receive any special offers from the Meetic group websites or from another partners companies, let us know when you subscribe, or alternatively at any time by going to "My Account" on the match.com website, or contact us by mail.</p>

<p>Meetic.com may occasionally share general socio-demographic information that does not include names with selected partners to allow them to target their announcements (by age category, gender, etc.). In this case, we will not send these partners any information that would allow them to identify you.</p>

<p>The information contained in your personal ad, your search criteria and your profile can be accessed on the Meetic Group Websites, on the web, by email (newsletters), by mobile telephone or on our Audiotel Service (a value-added telephone Service). In addition, these information may be broadcasted directly by meetic.com, or via our partners to persons interested in the Meetic Group services, through newsletters or third-party websites, or by all other electronic (email, text messaging, etc.) or audiovisual (radio, television, etc.) communication tools, or by written press (newspapers, magazines, etc.), in order to increase your chances of meeting someone by promoting your person ads, search criteria and profile.</p>

<p>Consequently, the Member explicitly authorises the Meetic Group to reproduce and broadcast the information contained in his/her personal ad, search criteria or profile (personal information, description, images, videos, etc.) on all or part of the Meetic Group Services (on the Meetic Group websites, on the Internet, by email, Audiotel) and/or in a general manner, on all distribution media, in particular audiovisual communication (press, radio, analogue television, digital television, cable or satellite) or electronic communication (email, Internet), throughout the entire world and for the length of time established in these Terms of Use between the Member and one of our websites.</p>

<p>The Member explicitly authorises the Meetic Group to transfer the information you provided through the Services and the benefits of the above mentioned rights to the service providers, partners and eventual successors of the relevant Meetic Group entity.</p>

<p>If you no longer wish for the Meetic Group or its partners to reproduce or broadcast the information comprised in your personal ad, your search criteria, or your profile, you can terminate your account on the Meetic Group websites following the conditions detailed in the Article "Termination". Since this information is comprised of your personal ad, your search criteria and your profile, the termination will only take effect upon the next update or version of these communications (printed, press, audiovisual, or electronic) containing your personal ad, your search criteria and your profile information.</p>
