We at Progress Software Corporation ("Progress Software") are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers and business partners, while building a long-lasting relationship with you. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you when you visit our site.

This policy covers how Progress Software collects, uses and protects the information it gathers through your use of the Progress Web sites and in connection with off-line communications. Specifically, Progress Software may collect this information from offline and online registrations and forms, communications and interactions, and sales inquiries and transactions. Progress also may use third party sources, such as opt-in lists.

No matter how Progress Software comes to have your information, we want you to know that it respects the privacy of your information and that you should be aware of how we handle it.

## Information Gathered and Tracked by Progress Software

**Organizational and Personal Information You Knowingly Give Us.**

Within our Web sites, you may be asked to give us personal or organizational information in order to purchase or receive information about a product or service. We may collect this information through different methods, including:

  * **Registration Forms.** We encourage all visitors to register with Progress Software, although registration is not required, except for access to our premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (like name and email address) and references that help us better serve you. Your name and email address may be used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. To opt out of receiving communications from Progress Software, please [Contact Us](mailto:unsubscribe@progress.com).
  * **Order Forms and Enrollment Forms.** Our order forms securely collect visitor’s contact information and financial information (like your credit card number and other billing information). Contact information on the order form is used for order fulfillment and may be shared with our Partners or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfill your request. The information that we require in our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up, we will share your contact information with other Progress Software partner companies only, not with other outside companies.

You may also be given the option of registering a profile with us which would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. You may opt out of this feature at any time by changing/canceling your profile online.




Progress Software may collect other information, including, but not necessarily limited to:

  * Contact information, such as name, physical address, telephone number(s), email address, and company. The majority of the information collected under this category is business contact information and when this information is collected in forms on our web site, it is collected and/or transmitted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
  * Transactional information, including information about the products and services you purchase or download or about which you make an inquiry.
  * User preferences, such as product requirements, areas of industry interest, newsletters, community choices and other information you select in the customer profile when registering on Progress Software’s web site or indicated by your use of the Progress Software Web sites.
  * Financial/credit card and payment information.
  * Event and conference participation information, such as lectures, classes or booths attended or visited during an event or conference hosted or attended by Progress. If we use electronic tracking technologies at an event, we will provide notice in the event registration materials and/or correspondence.



We may also supplement information you provide with information received from third parties.

**Information Gathered through Electronic Protocols.**

**Statistics and Information Collected as You Browse Our Web Sites**

As you browse our Web sites, Progress Software's Web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via Web server logs, we monitor statistics such as:

  * How many people visit our Web sites.
  * Which pages people visit on our Web sites.
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "yahoo.com" or "aol.com").  

  * Which browsers people use to visit our Web sites.



While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our Web sites, to monitor their performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use.

Our Web sites also log Host Names (or IP addresses when the Host Name is not available) for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analyzed to maintain systems and information security and allow us to constantly improve the value and the availability of the Web content.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique User ID. Cookies on the Web sites may collect a unique identifier, user preferences and profile information and membership information. Progress's server will query your browser to see if there are "cookies" previously set by the Progress Web sites.

We use cookies to deliver Web content specific to your interests and to control access to restricted content.

You can also set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. Users can generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion and might be required to complete certain functions on our Web sites.

**Flash Cookies**

We also use flash cookies, also known as "local shared objects," on our sites that employ Flash technology. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember the site's settings to personalize the look and feel of the site. Like normal cookies, Flash cookies are represented as small files on your computer.

**Embedded URLs**

We also uses a tracking technique that employs embedded URLs to allow use of the site without cookies. Embedded URLs allow limited information to follow you as you navigate the site, but is not associated with personal information and is not used beyond the session.

**Embedded Pixels**

On our Web site, we may use embedded pixel technologies on selected pages for the purposes of identifying unique user visits to the Progress Software Web sites as opposed to aggregate hits. In addition, embedded pixels or other technologies may be used in emails to provide information on when the email was opened to track marketing campaign responsiveness; information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient's email address.

**Third Party Cookies**

Progress Software has engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from visitors to the Web site. The service provider(s) set cookies on behalf of Progress Software.

**Widgets**

Our Web sites include Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites). Some information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.
