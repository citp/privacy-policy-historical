# Privacy Policy | Datorama

Datorama is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Policy describes our web site and platform privacy practices (“Privacy Policy”). This Privacy Policy applies to data collected by Datorama Inc and its subsidiaries (“Datorama”) through the Datorama.com web site, other webpages that we operate in which we post a direct link to this Privacy Policy, and the Datorama Platform (each a “Datorama Site”). By voluntarily using a Datorama Site and/or providing data or other information via a Datorama Site, you are indicating your consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by its terms.

Datorama complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

**Personal Information**  
You can visit a Datorama Site without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need certain personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) from you.  
You may choose to provide us with Personal Information (such as your name, email address, phone number and company name) through a Datorama Site when you elect to register with Datorama in order to download or access our products or services. When you provide Personal Information in order to register with Datorama, such Personal Information will be used in order to provide you with access to the requested products, services content and/or information. We may also use the Personal Information to help us understand who is using our products and services and to help us manage business development activities. Datorama may also use Personal Information for marketing purposes. For example, Datorama may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in our products or services and to send you information regarding Datorama and its partners, such as information about promotions or events. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this Personal Information as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.

**Newsletters**  
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. If you no longer wish to receive our emails, newsletters or other communications you may unsubscribe at any time by using the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of such communication or by email at support@datorama.com.

**Statistical Information**  
In addition, we sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to a Datorama Site to help us provide better customer service and to make a Datorama Site as user friendly as possible. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we also measure visitor activity on a Datorama Site. However, when we do so, we do so in ways that keep the information anonymous. Datorama may use this data to analyze trends and statistics. None of the information described in this paragraph is reviewed at an individual level.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on all Datorama Sites. We do not add the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on a Datorama Site. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate a Datorama Site. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

Datorama uses persistent cookies to store a unique cryptographic hash value so you don’t have to enter your username more than once on a given computer. The information stored does not contain any personally identifiable information. See the Choice/Opting-out section for information on how to opt-out from datorama tracking service.

**Third Party Cookies**  
A Datorama Site may use cookies that permit select third party partners to serve you Datorama-related content on their sites or elsewhere on the Internet. This is based on your prior visits to a Datorama Site. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

**IP Addresses**  
When you visit a Datorama Site, Datorama collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Datorama uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which customers and visitors navigate a Datorama Site. Datorama also collects IP addresses from customers whey they log into the Datorama platform as part of Datorama’s security features.

**Web Beacons/Usage Analytics**  
Datorama employs, or our third party advertising partners employ, web beacons and usage analytics software that help us better manage content on a Datorama Site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

**Links to Other Web Sites**  
A Datorama Site may contain links to other web sites. Datorama is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. The links from a Datorama Site do not imply that Datorama endorses or has reviewed the third party web sites. We suggest contacting the operators of those web sites directly for information regarding their privacy policies.

**Blogs/Forums/Chat Rooms/Bulletin Boards**  
If you use a blog, forum, chat room or bulletin board on a Datorama Site (“Forum(s)”), you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in a Forum can be read, collected, or used by other users of such Forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in a Forum.

**Customer Testimonials**  
Datorama may post customer testimonials on a Datorama Site, which may contain personally identifiable information. We obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting their testimonial.

**Our Disclosure of Your Personal Information and Other Information**  
Datorama is not in the business of selling your Personal Information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

  * Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Information may be part of the transferred assets.
  * Related Companies: We may also share your Personal Information with our subsidiaries, affiliates and other related companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
  * Credit Card Processing: We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on Datorama’s behalf.
  * Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Datorama, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
  * Legal Requirements: Datorama may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Datorama, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of a Datorama Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.



**Joint Offerings**  
From time to time, Datorama may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services. If you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly-offered product or service from us, Datorama may share information collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our joint promotion partner(s). Datorama does not control our business partners’ use of the information we share with them, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.

**International Transfer of Information Collected**  
To facilitate Datorama’s global operations, Datorama may transfer and access information regarding Datorama customers from around the world, including the United States. This Privacy Policy shall apply even if Datorama transfers information regarding Datorama customers to other countries.

**Customer Data**  
Datorama customers may electronically submit data or information to the Datorama platform for hosting and processing purposes (“Customer Data”). Datorama will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the Datorama Terms of Use, or as may be required by law. In accordance with the Datorama Terms of Use, Datorama may access Customer Data only for the purpose of providing the Datorama services, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, at a Datorama customer’s request in connection with customer support matters, or as may be required by law.

**Security**  
Personal Information collected through a Datorama Site is kept in a secure database and all reasonable precautions are taken to secure this data. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from a Datorama Site may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to Datorama via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to Datorama via the Internet. The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information on our registration pages or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
