# Privacy Policy | Datorama

## PRIVACY POLICY

**Last Updated: January 26, 2017**

Datorama, Inc. (“Datorama”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your information, and in this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy) we describe our web site privacy practices with regard to data collected by Datorama through the Datorama.com web site and other webpages that we operate in which we post a direct link to this Privacy Policy. Datorama sites are accessible worldwide, but Datorama is a U.S.-based company whose sites are hosted and operated in the United States. By voluntarily using a Datorama site and/or providing data or other information via a Datorama site, you are indicating your consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by its terms.

## EU-US PRIVACY SHIELD

Datorama complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information from European Union member countries. Datorama has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program please visit [www.privacyshield.gov](http://www.privacyshield.gov/) (the certification page can be found [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt00000004EdpAAE)).

## NOTICE

When you register with Datorama, we may need certain personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) from you. When we collect such Personal Information, you will receive timely and appropriate notice describing what Personal Information we are collecting and how it will be used. You may choose to provide us with Personal Information (such as your name, email address, phone number and company name) through a Datorama site when you elect to register with Datorama in order to receive a demo of Datorama platform. At a minimum, you will always be able to opt-out from receiving marketing materials from Datorama. If we determine that applicable national law requires that more stringent requirements (opt-in) be applied before you receive marketing material or other communications from us, we will implement the same.

## USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

When you provide Personal Information in order to register with Datorama, such Personal Information will be used in order to provide you with access to the requested content and/or information that we feel may interest you, or where you have consented to be contacted by us; to carry out obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us; to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service; and for other user support purposes. We may also use the Personal Information to help us understand who is using our products and services, to help us manage business development activities, and for research and analytical purposes. We will also use your Personal Information as we reasonably believe necessary to protect the safety, rights, property, or security of Datorama, Datorama sites or any third party, including to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; to comply with applicable legal or regulatory obligations and as evidence in litigation; and to enforce our Terms of Use.

Datorama may also use Personal Information for marketing purposes. For example, Datorama may use information you provide to contact you about changes to our services or to further discuss your interest in our products or services and to send you information regarding Datorama and its partners, such as information about promotions or events. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this Personal Information as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.

## ACCESS

If you wish to access, amend, or confirm that Datorama has Personal Information relating to you, or if you wish to correct or delete your Personal Information if it is inaccurate, please notify us at [privacy@datorama.com](mailto:privacy@Datorama.com). We will respond to your request within a reasonable time.

## NEWSLETTERS

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. If you no longer wish to receive our emails, newsletters or other communications you may unsubscribe at any time by using the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of such communication.

## STATISTICAL AND LOG INFORMATION

In addition, we may automatically collect information from visits to a Datorama site to help us provide better customer service and to make a Datorama site as user friendly as possible. This information may include, without limitation, your IP address, the hostname of your device, browser information, domain name, and dates and times of site visits. We also measure visitor activity on a Datorama site, such as the webpages that users view. Datorama may use this data to analyze site traffic and trends and statistics.

## DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE

Datorama sites do not respond to Do Not Track signals. For more information about Do Not Track signals, please click here (<http://www.allaboutdnt.com/>).

## THIRD PARTY COOKIES

A Datorama site may use cookies that permit select third party partners to serve you Datorama-related content on their sites or elsewhere on the Internet. This is based on your prior visits to a Datorama Site. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

## CHOICE

We will always give you an opportunity to choose to opt-out before your Personal Information is (1) disclosed to a third party, or (2) to be used for a purpose that is materially different from that for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. The only exception to this choice would be where we are required to disclose your Personal Information pursuant to a governmental or judicial order, or law or regulation to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

## IP ADDRESSES

When you visit a Datorama site, Datorama collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-Personal Information. For example, Datorama uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which customers and visitors navigate a Datorama site.

## WEB BEACONS/USAGE ANALYTICS

Datorama employs, or our third-party advertising partners employ, web beacons and usage analytics software that help us better manage content on a Datorama site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ Personal Information.

## LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES

A Datorama site may contain links to other web sites. Datorama is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. The links from a Datorama site do not imply that Datorama endorses or has reviewed the third-party web sites. We suggest contacting the operators of those web sites directly for information regarding their privacy policies.

## BLOGS/FORUMS/CHAT ROOMS/BULLETIN BOARDS

If you use a blog, forum, chat room or bulletin board on a Datorama site (“Forum(s)”), you should be aware that any Personal Information you submit in a forum can be read, collected, or used by other users of such forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in a forum.

## OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION

Datorama is not in the business of selling your Personal Information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

  * Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Information may be part of the transferred assets.
  * Related Companies: We may also share your Personal Information with current or future subsidiaries, affiliates and other related companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
  * Credit Card Processing: We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on Datorama’s behalf.
  * Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Datorama, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
  * Legal Requirements: Datorama may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Datorama, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of a Datorama site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.



## ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ONWARD TRANSFER

We will not transfer Personal Information originating in the EU to third parties unless such third parties have entered into an agreement in writing with us requiring them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection to your Personal Information as required by the Principles of the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. We will only transfer Personal Information to cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, who need the information in order to provide services to or perform activities on behalf of Datorama. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Datorama is potentially liable.

## JOINT OFFERINGS

From time to time, Datorama may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services. If you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly-offered product or service from us, Datorama may share information collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our joint promotion partner(s). Datorama does not control our business partners’ use of the information we share with them, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.

## INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF INFORMATION COLLECTED

To facilitate Datorama’s global operations, Datorama may transfer and access information regarding Datorama customers from around the world, including the United States. This Privacy Policy shall apply even if Datorama transfers information regarding Datorama customers to other countries.

## SECURITY

To protect Personal Information collected and stored by Datorama, we have in place reasonable and appropriate technical and operational security measures to prevent Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from a Datorama site may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to Datorama via a Datorama site or e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information to Datorama via the Internet and keep any passwords confidential. The security of your Personal Information is important to us.

## PRIVACY SHIELD INDEPENDENT RECOURSE MECHANISM, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION JURISDICTION

European Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Datorama at: [privacy@datorama.com](mailto:privacy@datorama.com).

Datorama has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles to JAMS, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States to assist with the complaint resolution process. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit <https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield> for more information and to file a complaint.

Datorama is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to ensure compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield principles outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website <https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint>, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

## DATA INTEGRITY AND PURPOSE LIMITATION

Datorama will take appropriate steps to make sure the Personal Information in our records is accurate. Datorama collects only as much Personal Information as is needed for specific, identified purposes, and will not use it for other purposes without obtaining your consent.
