Subscribers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations, relating to the such Subscribers’ use of personal data or collection of personal data in connection with the use of our Platform Services by individuals with whom our Subscribers interact. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Platform Services or you otherwise believe that a Subscriber uses our Platform Services to process your personal data, and you contact us regarding this data, then you will be directed to contact our Subscriber for assistance with any requests or questions relating to your personal data, including without limitation any requests to access, amend or erase your personal data.

**What information do we collect?**

We collect information and data from you in two ways. First, we collect information you manually provide to us, including registration info like your name and email address.

You will know which data categories you provide to us, because you will affirmatively enter and submit the data. Any such information you provide us in connection with the registration for our Platform Services is deemed “Account Information.”  Databricks may receive information from third parties regarding the companies and users who use our Sites and Platform Services and may combine such information with the information we receive or collect from you.

When you use the Platform Services, we automatically record information about how our users (both account holders and other users on a user account) (“Users”) use the Platform Services (known as “Usage Data”).

**Do we share your information?**

We do not share personal data except as follows:

  * with affiliated and unaffiliated service providers that help us conduct our business, subject to confidentiality obligations;

_Rights of Access, Modification, Deletion and Restriction of Your Information._

Individuals located in certain countries, including the European Economic Area, have certain statutory rights (including under Privacy Shield) in relation to their personal data.

Please note that we cannot process your request directly, as your information is controlled by that Subscriber, and we do not directly have a relationship with you; or

We will endeavor to promptly respond to your request.  Although Databricks makes good faith efforts to provide users of our Sites and Platform Services with access to their personal data, there may circumstances in which Databricks is unable to provide access including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing would be disproportionate to the risks to of the User’s privacy in the case in question, where the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive or where it is commercially proprietary. If you request deletion of your personal data, please note that we may continue to retain certain of your personal data in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required or allowed by law.

Databricks considers protecting the security of your data to be its number one responsibility.  Databricks has received a certification to the internationally recognized industry standard information security management system, [ISO27001](https://cert.schellmanco.com/?certhash=4FjlS5AYCp6Z), and aligns its security practices to the internationally recognized industry standard code of practice for protecting personal data in the cloud, ISO27018.  Databricks encrypts communications you make with our Sites and the Platform Services, e.g., entering your username and password or information into forms, using TLS (transport layer security) or other industry standard technologies.
