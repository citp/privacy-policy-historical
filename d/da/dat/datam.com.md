## Security mesures

At FNBox security is important. FNBox employs appropriate measures, including advanced technology, to protect information collected against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. These measures may include, among others, encryption procedures, physical access security and other appropriate technologies. FNBox continually reviews and enhances its security systems, as necessary. Vostu stores information about its users on servers, where only employees who need information to perform a specific job are granted access to it. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect data, you accept that there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control and that the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the Site cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, we are not responsible for any third party which may view or tampered with the information in transit.

Those who, in accordance with the laws in force, do not have such legal capacity may only use the Site through their legal representative, who shall remain liable for all the acts performed on behalf of the incompetent.

Whenever the lack of capacity is due to age, such lack may not be cured. Access to the Site by a minor is strictly prohibited, unless the laws of the place in which the minor resides provide otherwise. In this case, liability arising from services to which minors have access, shall be imposed on the adults responsible for them. Therefore, minors who access the Site shall obtain their parents', guardians', or legal representatives' permission, whenever such access is permitted by law.

As regards legal persons' representatives, Users shall have sufficient authority to act on behalf of the represented entity and to bind it to the terms hereof. If the User lacks such sufficient authority, or acts beyond the authorized scope, he/she shall be deemed to be bound personally.
