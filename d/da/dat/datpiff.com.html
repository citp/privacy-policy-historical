                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">Our Commitment to Privacy</div>
                        <p>Our  Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the  highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in  dealing with our clients and partners. The Policy is designed to assist you in  understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you  provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our  site and our products and services. This statement will be continuously assessed  against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</p>

                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">What  Information Do We Collect?</div>
                        <p>When  you visit our Web site you may provide us with two types of information:  personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an  individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis  as you and others browse our Web site.</p>
                        <p><strong>1.  Personal Information You Choose to Provide</strong></p>
                        <p>Credit  Card Information</p>
                        <p>If  you choose to purchase products or services from us or our partners, you may  need to give personal information and authorization to obtain information from  various credit services. For example, you may need to provide the following  information:</p>
                        <p>Name<br>
                        Mailing  address<br>
                        E-mail  address<br>
                        Credit  card number<br>
                        Home  and business phone number<br>
                        E-mail  Information</p>
                        <p>In  addition to providing the foregoing information to our partners, if you choose  to correspond further with us through e-mail, we may retain the content of your  e-mail messages together with your e-mail address and our responses. We provide  the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the  maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.</p>
                        <p>If you choose to register with us, we also store the information that you provide to us to aid in accessing and servicing your account.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, when interacting with our website, we may store information to assist in statistical reporting.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.  Web Site Use Information</strong></p>
                        <p>Similar  to other Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology  called "cookies" (see explanation below, "<a href="#cookies">What Are  Cookies?</a>") and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web  site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may  include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web  site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. This  information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is  associated with you as an individual.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Location Data</strong></p>
						<p>When you access DatPiff through a mobile application, we may collect Geolocation information from you, including proximity to merchants.</p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">How  Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</div>
                        <p>Broadly  speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our  business activities, providing customer service and making available other  products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally,  we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important  changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find  valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed  and managed under our traditional standards designed to safeguard the  security and privacy of our customers' personal information. As a customer, you  will be given the opportunity, at least once annually, to notify us of your  desire not to receive these offers.</p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle"><a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a>What  Are Cookies?</div>
                        <p>Cookies  are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the  computer used to access a Web site. They are small pieces of data that are  stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember  what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent  interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to  streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier  for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial  transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience  easier and more personalized.</p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">How  Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</div>
                        <p>We  use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to  gather information about our Web site users' browsing activities in order to  constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. This  information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly  manner and to continually improve our Web site to better meet the needs of our  customers and prospective customers.</p>
                        <p>Cookies  help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in  the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our Web site as they  move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many  people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site's visitor capacity. We do  not use these technologies to capture your individual e-mail address or any  personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send  focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you.</p>
                        <p>We also allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">Sharing  Information with Affiliates</div>
                        <p>From  time to time you may notice offers from outside companies advertised on our Web  site. We take measures to select product or service providers that are  responsible and afford privacy protections to their customers. However, we  cannot make any representations about the practices and policies of these  companies.</p>
                        <p>We may share your geolocation data with affiliates when using our mobile applications.</p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">Sharing  Information with Strategic Partners</div>
                        <p>We  may enter into strategic marketing alliances or partnerships with third parties  who may be given access to personal information including your name, address,  telephone number and e-mail for the purpose of providing you information  regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In  connection with strategic marketing alliances or partnerships, we will retain  all ownership rights to the information, and we will not share information regarding  your social security number or other personal financial data that we may have.</p>
                        <p>We will make every effort to notify users when an alliance or partnership would result in the sharing of their information.</p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">Notice  of New Services and Changes</div>
                        <p>Occasionally,  we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important  changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find  valuable. As our client, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your  desire not to receive these offers by clicking on a response box when you  receive such an offer, updating your mailing preferences in your account, or by sending us an e-mail request from our <a href="/contact.php">contact page</a>. </p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">How  Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</div>
                        <p>When  you send confidential personal credit card information to our processors like PayPal and Google, from our Web site, a  secure server software which they have licensed encrypts all information you  input before it is sent to them. The information is scrambled en route and  decoded once it reaches their Web site.</p>
                        <p>Other  e-mail that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that  security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information.  For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as  email or account passwords to us through an unsecured e-mail.</p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">How  Do We Protect Your Information?</div>
                        <p><strong>Information  Security.</strong></p>
                        <p>We  utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of  personal information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and  accidental loss, alteration or destruction. All password information stored with us is encoded and not stored in plaintext.                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Employee  Access, Training and Expectations.</strong></p>
                        <p>Our  corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to  the protection of customer information. In general, our business practices  limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and  disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes and  transactions.</p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">How  Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</div>
                        <p>You  may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we  collect online and maintain in our database by <a href="/contact.php">contacting us</a>. </p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">Do  We Disclose Information to Outside Parties?</div>
                        <p>We  may provide aggregate information about our customers, sales, Web site traffic  patterns and related Web site information to our affiliates or reputable third  parties, but this information will not include personally identifying data,  except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">What  About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</div>
                        <p>We  may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when  we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of  our legal rights.</p>
                        <div class="largeLabelTitle">What  About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</div>
                        <p>We  are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from  our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to  other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that  may be useful to the users of our Web site.</p>
                        <p>Please  remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site,  our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any  other Web site, including Web sites which have a link to our Web site, is  subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules  and policies before proceeding.</p>
