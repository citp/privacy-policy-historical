Our job is to bring people to you for you to meet, and this is one way we carry out this task.

Your public data may continue to be accessible through search engines even after you have closed your account here. We cannot guarantee this can be removed. If you not feel comfortable with this, you should not use this web site, and you should close your account immediately.
