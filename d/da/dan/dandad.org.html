<b>Other Information that we Collect</b> <br>
When you visit the site, we log the IP address of the machine you used to access our site with. The IP address is a unique number that is used on the Internet to identify a unique computer for the purposes of allowing computers to communicate with each other.
</p>

<p>
Certain features of our site require Cookies in order to function. A Cookie is a small piece of information that is placed on your computer, and is used to differentiate you from other users accessing our site. We use this so that we can ensure your information is kept separate from that of other users of the site. For more information on cookies, please refer to the documentation provided with your web browser software.
</p>

<p>
We may also collect information on the type of web browser that you are using, the operating system that your computer uses, and (where applicable) the link that you followed to get to our website. We use this information to produce general statistics about the numbers of unique visitors to the site and what software they use. In turn, these statistics are used to channel effort into further developing our site to meet the needs of our users.
</p>


<p>
<b>Security </b><br>
D&amp;AD takes the security of any information we hold very seriously, and will always implement security measures that are in line with, or exceed current best practices and recommendations.
</p>

<p>
Where necessary, and in common with other websites, we use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to ensure that information provided to us is not visible to anybody else when in transit between your computer and our servers. You can tell when SSL is in use by the presence of a small "padlock" symbol in the status bar of your web browser.
</p>

<p>
In addition, our web servers are housed behind a secure firewall that prevents access to our databases from unauthorised users. All of our servers are housed in a secure environment with high levels of physical security, and access is only permitted to a handful of security screened staff.
</p>

<p>
<b>Children (under 18's)</b><br>
We encourage parents and guardians to supervise the use of the Internet by their children, and to educate them about providing personal information both on the Internet and elsewhere.

</p>


<p>
<b>Direct Marketing</b><br>
