IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND DISCLAIMERS, DO NOT ACCESS OUR WEBSITES.

Data Collection

This Privacy Policy includes a description of our policies with respect to our collection and use of certain information through our Website. We may collect two types of information from you: (a) personal information that you voluntarily provide to us, and (b) usage information concerning our Websites that we automatically collect as you interact with our Websites.

a) Personal Information that You Voluntarily Provide to Us

The majority of times that you visit our Websites, your use can occur without you telling us who you are and without providing any information about yourself. However, there are times that we may ask you to voluntarily provide information ("Personal Information") about yourself through the Websites.  Our requests for personal information will only occur to serve specific purposes, including, but not limited to, (1) your purchase of our products; (2) for you to receive our newsletters; (3) for you to participate in user surveys; (4) to process your registration with our Websites, including verifying that your e-mail address is active and valid; (5) to improve our Websites; (6) to communicate with you regarding information such as products, services, or offers, which we believe you may be interested; (7) to respond to your inquiries; (8) to contact you regarding any of our contests, sweepstakes, or promotions within which you have participated: (9) for our own internal business purposes; and (10) for other purposes as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. 

We will not sell, rent, or lease your Personal Information to third parties. However, we may need to provide limited Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of processing orders, processing credit card and other payment transactions, and to deliver products or services to you that you have purchased. Personal financial information will only be used for the reason it was provided, such as to complete a purchase. You are under no obligation to provide us with Personal Information. However, your refusal to provide requested Personal Information will likely limit your ability to participate in certain services or activities offered on our Websites, particularly when the requested Personal Information is noted as being mandatory or required for you to participate in a particular service or activity.

b) Information We May Automatically Collect

Our Websites may use “cookies” or other programs or tracking technologies to collect basic information from you as you use our Websites (“Automatically Collected Information”). A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used for various purposes to collect information about activity at our Websites. Some cookies may be used to recall Personal Information that you previously provided when you used our Websites. This Automatically Collected Information is generally used to enhance and personalize your web experience with us, and to provide us with basic information about how users access and benefit from our Websites. Such Automatically Collected Information may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, browser, duration of time on our Websites, what pages were viewed at our Websites, the duration of time on pages within our Websites, keywords searched at our Websites, products purchased through our Websites, the language you use at our Websites, your operating system, and what you clicked on at our Websites.  You have the option of blocking or deleting cookies through the use of your browser.  However, if you block or delete cookies your use and enjoyment of our Websites may be impaired.

Thus, if you are in a location outside of the United States, by using our Websites you consent to the transfer to and processing of your information in the United States.

Our Policies Regarding Children

If you are under 18 years of age, please do not submit any information without the express consent and participation of a parent or guardian.

Our Website Security

We will take commercially reasonable security measures to protect and secure your Personal Information. However, no transmission of data over the Internet or electronic storage of information can be 100% secure. Thus, while the Daniel Companies strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot warrant the security of any Personal Information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your Personal Information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security in our systems.

Consent to Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time, which change will be effective 7 days following us posting a revised Privacy Policy on our Websites. Your continued use of our Websites 7 days following such posting means you accept and consent to those changes.
