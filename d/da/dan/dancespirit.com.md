# Privacy Statement | DanceMedia, LLC

At Dance Spirit, we respect your right to privacy and we understand that users of the Dance Spirit Web site need to be in control of their personal information. “Personal information” includes, but is not limited to, name, address, telephone number, email address and credit card information. Dance Spirit does not sell, rent, swap or otherwise disclose any of this information. Dance Spirit adopted this Privacy Policy to inform users of the Dance Spirit Internet site how the site does collect, store and use personal information submitted via the site.

  1. **Collection of Information**  
Certain applications on the Dance Spirit Web site may require users to register or to provide personal information in order to make a commerce transaction, to enter a contest, or to subscribe to a newsletter. Such personal information is not shared or sold to third parties. To better understand the needs of our Web site users, we may also request demographic information. Entry of such information is optional and if you choose not to enter such information, you can successfully use these applications. If we request demographic information, we will not share information about you as an individual with any other entity. If we do share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.
  2. **Mailing Lists**  
If you provide your email address, Dance Spirit may contact you periodically with special offers, updated information and new services. Any emails sent to you by Dance Spirit offer you the option to be removed from the email mailing list.
  3. **Information to third parties**  
Dance Spirit may occasionally present a special contest or promotion on its Web site that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s), we will provide a statement to that effect.
  4. **Financial information**  
Dance Spirit will protect any personal financial information that you share with us. If you make a purchase online, we will use your credit card number only to process your payment and will not use it for marketing purposes. For reasons of security, credit card information is not stored on our Web server. We will retain order information for our records, but this information is never shared with third parties.
  5. **Links**  
Our site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy policies we don’t control. Once you leave our servers (you can check where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can’t find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site’s homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information. Dance Spirit is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
  6. **Children- COPPA Compliance**  
This website is not directed to children or intended to be used by children under age 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information for contests and subscriptions or use our public discussion areas. We do not advertise to children or solicit personal information from children and we never intentionally release the names of children to third parties. Certain applications on our site ask users to submit an email address but it is only used to respond to a user’s request. All information posted by users is moderated and any personally identifiable information is removed before it is posted on our site.
