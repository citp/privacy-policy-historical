    <td><font size="2">We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate 
      our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices 
      with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal 
      information provided by visitors to our Web site. By using this site, you 
      signify your assent to our privacy practices and the terms and conditions 
      of our Web site. 
      <p>If this policy is not agreeable to you, please do not use this site.</p>
      <p>WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?<br>
        Personal Information<br>
        We only collect personal information from visitors to our Web site when 
        they voluntarily provide it to us by completing our registration form 
        or electing to use one of our services. This Site collects any and all such 
        information and includes it in its customer database. </p>
      <p>If the Site features or conducts any special events, special promotions 
        or offers, contests or polls, a Member of the Site may be asked to provide 
        information in order to participate, if the Member voluntarily provides 
        that information, all such information may be collected by the Site and 
        included in its customer database. </p>
      <p>Non-Personal Information<br>
        When visitors access our Web site, certain non-personal information may 
        be collected from them including, but not limited to, their browser type 
        (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows 
        or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain name from which they accessed 
        the site (e.g., lycos.com). In addition, we may collect information about 
        visitors' browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit the 
        Web site and the areas or pages of our Web site that they visit. We do 
        not track any information about visitors once they leave our site. We 
        may use cookies (small text files that are stored on visitors computers 
        when they access our Web site) to collect this information. Information 
        collected through cookies may be combined with visitors' personal information. 
        Visitors are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so they may 
        not be able to use certain features on our Web site. The "help" 
        segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to configure a browser 
        to not accept new cookies, how to have the browser inform a user when 
        they receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from their hard drives. 
      </p>
      <p>IN WHAT WAY DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br>
        Our goal in collecting personal information is to provide visitors with 
        the most personalized Web experience possible and our advertisers with 
        an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little about 
        our visitors, we are able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements, 
        and provide better services. By the Member's use of the Site, the Member 
        expressly agrees that the Site may use any personal information that has 
        been provided by the Member or that has been collected by the Site about 
        the Member for any purpose, including without limitation, technical, administration, 
        research and development, customer administration, marketing, trading 
        in Personal Data, age verification, promotional and advertising use by 
        the Site or third parties authorized to use the information by the Site. 
        By the Member's use of the Site, the Member expressly agrees that the 
        Site may, in its sole discretion share, disclose, transfer, rent, license 
        or sell any of the personal information about Members that it has gathered 
        or collected with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties. </p>
      <p>SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE SITE.<br>
        Consistent with the Policies set forth in this Privacy Statement, the 
        Site has adopted and implemented reasonable and technologically feasible 
        procedures for maintaining the security, accuracy and integrity of all 
        personal information relating to Members that is collected by the Site. 
        All Members should consider any information provided to or collected by 
        the Site as non-confidential, and consequently the Site assumes no liability 
        or responsibility if any information relating to any Member is intercepted 
        and/or used by an unintended recipient. </p>
      <p>"OPT-IN" and "OPT-OUT" Provisions.<br>
        There may be occasions when a Member will be presented with special offers 
        either from the operators of the Site or from third-party service or content 
        providers, which may include consent to receive e-mail solicitations, 
        communications, newsletters, commercial advertising, or other promotional 
        or special event materials (collectively referred to as "Offers"). 
      </p>
      <p>"OPT-IN" -- Some Offers may be presented to the Member with 
        the option to express the subsciber's preference by either clicking or 
        entering "accept" (alternatively "yes") or "decline" 
        (alternatively "no"). By selecting or clicking the "accept" 
        or "yes" the Member indicates that the Member "OPTS-IN" 
        to that Offer and thereby agrees and assents that the Member's personal 
        information and data may be disclosed to third-parties. </p>
      <p>"OPT-OUT" -- Other Offers may be presented with a pre-selected 
        preference or choice. If the Member does not deselect the pre-selected 
        preference of choice (i.e. "OPT-OUT" of the Offer) then the 
        Site may transfer the Member's personal profile information to the third-party 
        service or content provider making the Offer. If the Member deselects 
        the pre-selected preference then no personal information about the Member 
        may be disclosed to the third-party service or content provider associated 
        with that specific offer. </p>
      <p>"OPT-OUT" Revocation Procedure. <br>
        The Site also offers all Members a procedure for "Opting-Out" 
        if the Member subsequently chooses to revoke any consent to receive Offers 
        by sending an e-mail to webmaster@magnusbucks.com, clearly stating that the 
        Member has revoked consent to receive any future Offers. </p>
      <p>CORPORATE CHANGES<br>
        In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset or stock sale, bankruptcy, 
        or other asset transfer (regardless of legal formality), any of our assets 
        may be transferred to a third party, including personal information collected 
        from visitors to our Web site. </p>

        By visiting this Web site, you are agreeing to the practices described 
        in this Privacy Policy. By visiting this site, you also accept, without 
        limitation or qualification, all terms and conditions concerning the use

        through our Web site (such as our advertisers) have different privacy 
        practices from those stated in this Privacy Policy, those third-party 
        privacy practices govern the collection and use of information you provide 
        when visiting those sites. We are not responsible for the policies, content, 
        and practices of other companies. </p>
      <p>WE PROTECT CHILDREN'S PRIVACY<br>
        Protecting the privacy of children is VERY important to us. For that reason 
        we do not structure any part of our site to attract anyone under the age 
        of 18 (21 in some areas) and we do not allow anyone under the age of 18 
        (21 in some areas) to register and become a member of our site. </p>

        section of the site you joined.</p>
      <p>HOW CAN YOU CONTACT THE WEB SITE OPERATOR?<br>

        of this site, or their interactions with this Web site, can contact the 
        website operator by sending an email to webmaster@magnusbucks.com.</p>
