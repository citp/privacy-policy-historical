Usage information, such as number of reports, types of reports and functions accessed by a particular UserID, may be tracked within the products. We do this to monitor authorized usage of the products, respond to questions from the user, for market research, and to improve the design and functionality of the products. We may also aggregate corporate or industry information accessed by all of our customers. We do this in order to appreciate the types of companies and industries for which our customers require information, which in turn improves the quality of the products. We do not correlate the accessed corporate or industry information to a specific user or to a particular organization.

Dun & Bradstreet shares information with third party service providers, such as credit card processors, auditors, attorneys, consultants, live help/chat providers and contractors, in order to support Dun & Bradstreet's Internet websites and business operations. Dun & Bradstreet contractually requires that these recipients only use the information for the intended purpose of the disclosure and that they destroy or return the information when it is no longer needed.

A Web beacon is a graphic image, such as a pixel tag or clear GIF, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity, such as whether the Web page or e-mail message is accessed or clicked.

We sometimes use Web beacons to provide an independent accounting of how many people visit our website or to gather statistics about browser usage on our website. Some of our Web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies. It is difficult for you to limit the use of Web beacons because there is no easy way to distinguish their use from alignment and other purposes. Web beacons may also be loaded from a different Web server than the rest of the page.
