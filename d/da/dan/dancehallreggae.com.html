<h3><center>About DancehallReggae.com</center></h3>
			<p>DancehallReggae.com began in 1995 as a regular personal homepage on a college server with emphasis in reggae. Since then the site went through numerous transformations, most of which were due to request from our visitors and has evolved to our current status. With an objective of informing and educating the world about the dancehall and reggae industry, the page also provides premium products and services to our visitors. As a result the site has been in increasing demand and simultaneously we have been adding new features to make DancehallReggae.Com more appealing.</p>

<p>On a weekly basis the HEADLINES is updated with reggae news from around the world. Nevertheless, during the week our DANCEHALL BOARD is always active and other features such as INTERVIEWS, PHOTOS from events and our LYRICS DIRECTORY are updated on a random basis. Also, from our diverse product line we provide dancehall DVDS, SOUND SYSTEM CDs, MIXED CDs, and the latest 7" RECORDS on the market. These pages are constantly updated and furthermore, the site is furnished with a GUESTBOOK for your comments, a HANGOUT with links to other pages and a site tributed to ENTERTAINERS who passed on.</p>

<p>We thank our visitors worldwide for showing their appreciation through our years or toil, past and future advertisers for their support and our contributors for their articles. Even though we may look professional, we are still going through a learning process and your comments and ideas are welcome.</p>
