                    <p>DanceJam, Inc. (<em>“DanceJam”</em>, <em>“we”</em>, <em>“us”</em>) provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of this website, located at <a href="http://www.dancejam.com">http://www.dancejam.com</a> (<em>“Site”</em>). Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the information that we collect through this Site as well as through our social networking service (<em>“Services”</em>). We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
                    
                    <p>By using our Site you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. “Processing” means using cookies on a computer or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States. If you reside outside the U.S. your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By visiting our Site and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the U.S.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@dancejam.com">privacy@dancejam.com</a>.</p>

                    <p>Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Services, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you may be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to DanceJam. This may happen in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Services, or if you desire to receive our newsletter or other marketing materials and information. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your IP address, user name, password, email address, physical address, telephone number, as well as age and other information that you decide to provide us with. In addition, you acknowledge that any content that you decide to upload would be visible and publicly accessible. Your profile information, as well as your name, e-mail and photo, are displayed to people in the DanceJam network to enable you to connect with people on DanceJam, as specified in your privacy settings. Once a Member, you may provide additional information in the profile section. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and to connect with other users. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you. In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Services. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.</p>
                    
                    <p>When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (<em>“Log Data”</em>). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. Except in the instances described herein, we do not use this information to identify you personally. We use it to monitor the use of the Site and of our Services, and for the Site’s technical administration.</p>

                    <p>Like many websites, we also use “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information.

In addition, please be aware that other parties such as advertisers may also place their own cookies on the Site, and may collect or solicit personal information from you. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site.
