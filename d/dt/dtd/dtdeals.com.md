In certain situations, we may also collect things like:

  * Part of your Social Security Number (if you use our renewal notifications services)
  * Your whole Social Security Number (if you apply for credit)

**Information you give us about others**

You may give us information about other people, such as the name and address of a gift recipient, or the name and contact information of someone who will pick up items for you at a store. We will only use this information for the specific reason you provide it.

**Information from other sources**

We may receive information about you from other sources, including third parties that help us update, expand, and analyze our records and identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.

**Information collected automatically online**

We collect information about your interactions with us, including the type of device or browser you're using, your IP address, your browsing behavior while on our website, and the URLs of the websites you were at before you visited our site (these are called "referring URLs").

Best Buy and our partners use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.

We may permit third-party service providers to collect and process some information from our digital properties. We may share personal information with those providers and may have similar arrangements with interest-based advertisers. We provide more information about interest-based ads below. Our digital properties are not designed to respond to "do not track" requests from browsers.

**Location information**

Some of our digital properties may collect your location to help you search for one of our stores or to use special mobile features within some of our stores. For example, Best Buy works with third parties to provide you helpful messaging in your mobile app when you come to our stores.

For any mobile application to identify your location, you must enable location services through your mobile device's settings. If you do not want Best Buy to collect this information or to enable these features, you can turn off location services on your mobile device. Best Buy has no control over your device's settings.

**Store cameras**

Our stores may use cameras for asset protection and other operational purposes, such as measuring traffic patterns and protecting and improving our business.

**Reviews and other content you provide**

Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. Be aware that anyone who accesses these areas may read, collect, and use the information you provide.
