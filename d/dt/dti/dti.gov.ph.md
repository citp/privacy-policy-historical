#### WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY

**Introduction**

The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), through its Knowledge Management and Information Service (KMIS), maintains [www.dti.gov.ph](http://www.dti.gov.ph/ "Official DTI website"), which aims to provide information about the Department, its mandates, programs, and services.

As an agency of the government of the Republic of the Philippines, the website adheres to the [Government Website Template Design (GWTD) Guidelines](http://i.gov.ph/policies/signed/memorandum-circular-rules-regulations-migrating-gwhs-dost-ict-office/annex-c-government-website-template-design-gwtd-guidelines/ "Government Website Template Design \(GWTD\) Guidelines") prescribed by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), which highlights, among others, compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Section 2.3.5) and recognizing the importance of improving user experience (Section 3).

**Data Collection and Use**

The website itself does not collect personal data that would identify a specific individual. However, as a means to gather feedback and improve services, the website incorporates three online surveys housed with Google Forms:

  1. The DTI Website Feedback form

  3. The Domestic Trade Exchange (DTEX) Trade Association Survey form



The type of data that are obtained include:

  1. Sex
  2. Age (within a given range)
  3. Occupation/field of specialization/sector



The non-personal data being collected using Google Forms is governed by the external website’s own privacy policy.

These are reported through aggregated data that in no way will identify an individual.

The website itself does not maintain cookies and neither does it access third-party cookies from Google Analytics, which has its own strict privacy guidelines.
