    <p class="disclaimer">Last Modified: June 4, 2009</p>
        <p>DTE Energy and its affiliate companies ("Company") understand your concerns about the use of your personal information online and are committed to protecting your privacy. We have implemented the following online privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to give you a better understanding of how we handle your information.</p>

For research purposes, we routinely collect the browser type and version and IP (Internet provider) address of visitors to our Web sites (see our policy regarding cookies).</p>
        <p>If you choose to use online customer services, including online payment services and product or service enrollment, or if you use our online job application process, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information. This may include your account number, name, mailing address, full or partial Social Security Number or tax identification number, phone number, e-mail address, financial information, etc. as appropriate and necessary for the online services you have selected. Your personal information will not knowingly be shared with any other organization for commercial purposes. The Company limits access to information or documents that contain your Social Security Number and ensures - to the extent practicable - the confidentiality of your Social Security Number.</p>

            <br>
DTE Energy may set cookies in order to provide automated services or surveys on its Web sites. We do collect the browser type and version and IP (Internet provider) address of visitors. We also gather aggregate information on what pages you access in our Web sites. The information we collect is used only for internal review to improve the content of our Web sites.<br>

            <a id="personal" name="personal"><b>How does the Company protect my personal information?</b></a>
            <br>
We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring personally identifiable information. When we transfer certain types of sensitive information such as financial, personal, account, or service information, we redirect visitors to a secure server where all communication between your computer and ours is scrambled into hard to decipher code and then translated back to meaningful communication. <br><br>
To use some of our online features, a full Social Security number (SSN), or the last four digits, are required for positive identification. We cross-check the SSN provided with information already contained in our billing system to verify that an online user is, in fact, the individual associated with that account. This is a standard business precaution to ensure your privacy and security. Using positive identification helps protect you from fraudulent service requests and slamming.<br>

            <br>
If you are using online transactional services, such as bill payment or our online job application feature, you may receive e-mails from us specific to your online transactions. You may also opt-in to receive our eNewsletters. We do not ask for personal or account information in an e-mail unless you have contacted us first and we need to clarify your request. Be sure any links embedded in the e-mail are actually taking you to a DTE Energy site. If you have any doubt an e-mail is really from us, go to our Web site directly by typing dteenergy.com into your browser window and navigating to the desired page.<br><br>We encourage you to report suspicious e-mail by forwarding the message to spoof@dteenergy.com.<br>
