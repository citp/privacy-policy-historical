                    <p class="section-paragraph">This privacy policy addresses DTS Technology Privacy Policy and it is not to be confused with this websites’ privacy policy.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">Any reference to “us”, “we”, ”DTS” or “ours relates to DTScout, reference to “user/s”, “you” or “your” relate to individuals that use or where exposed to DTS Technology. “Partners” or “Data Partners” relate to third party data companies and advertisers (demand Partners) and publisher websites/online services that distribute DTS Technology (supply Partners). The following privacy statement explains how users’ information is collected and shared with our Partners and reviews how we protect users privacy.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">By using our Technology, visiting this website or visiting our supply Partners’ websites you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information as described in this DTS Technology Privacy Policy. Additionally you consent to adhering to privacy guidelines that are at least as strict as the guidelines set forth.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">WE WILL NOT USE OR SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH ANYONE EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-header">Personal Information</h3>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">Collection:</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">DTS does not actively collect nor store any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email or residence addresses, telephone numbers, etc.  Other than PII you explicitly provide voluntarily on our website contact form or via direct communication.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">Use:</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">Personal Information shall be used solely in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.  Furthermore, DTS obligates its Partners to do the same. This means that neither our Partners nor us can relate any of the information we collect or aggregate to an individual user.</p>

                        <p class="section-paragraph">While personal information or PII could be used for identifying a specific person and relay information to that person; non personal information (NPII) on its own cannot be associated with a specific person but may assist in personalizing content and hold commercial value (interested in cars and education, speaks English, using a mobile device, etc.). Based on NPII a user may be anonymously associated with audiences and receive more personalized content and advertisement.</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">Only information of commercial value is collected and retained for limited periods (see below), and generally relates to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Demographics: Approximated geographic location (country/city), spoken language.</li>
<li>Behavioral: Advertising interaction, sites visited and searches conducted in the DTS network.</li>
<li>Technical: Screen resolution, browser attributes, IP address (assigned automatically to any user when connecting to the Internet).</li>
</ol>
                        <p class="section-paragraph">Collection:</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">We use various technologies (see below) in order to automatically collect NPII on our supply partners’ websites and through their services. We collect the NPII directly or indirectly through our demand partners. All DTS demand Partners are leading companies that took upon themselves to comply with self-regulatory privacy protection criteria.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">Use:</p>
<p class="section-paragraph">In order to allow for more efficient and relevant ad serving, DTS and its Partners may collect, share and aggregate NPII (with third party NPII). This generally results in segmenting and categorizing the data in order to create interest-based audiences (traveling, autos, entertainment, etc.). The goal is to facilitate more efficient and relevant online advertising, in this case, using anonymous data.</p>
