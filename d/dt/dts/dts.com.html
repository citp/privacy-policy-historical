      <p style="">Last Revised March 19, 2010&nbsp;</p> <p style="">DTS values the relationships we have built with our customers and is committed to protecting your privacy and the handling of any personal information we obtain from you. This DTS Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) details the type of personally identifiable information collected from users of DTS websites, including but not limited to www.dts.com, as well as the means by which we collect it, and our use and/or transfer of said information. This Privacy Policy applies to other websites which we run and which display a direct link to this Privacy Policy, but does not apply to websites that do not link to our Privacy Policy, to websites which have their own privacy policy or information collected by DTS by any other means. </p> <p style="">As used in this Privacy Policy, “DTS” refers to DTS, Inc., and its subsidiary and affiliated entities, individually or together and is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “DTS”, “we”, “us”, and “our”. We refer to individuals who access our website as “users” and when we use the term “personally identifiable information”, we are referring to information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number. Any other information that is directly associated with personally identifiable information, for example consumer product preferences, is also treated as personally identifiable information under this Privacy Policy. </p> <p style="">DTS is committed to handling all personal information subject to the EU data protection laws received from Member States of the European Union in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles published by the US Department of Commerce. Regardless where it originated, all user data subject to this Privacy Policy receives the same level of privacy protection as described herein. </p> <p style="">The terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws.</p> <h3 style="">Collection of Your Personal Information</h3> <p style="">Through our website, we collect different types of personally identifiable information from our users.</p> <p style=""><u style="">Information You Provide to Us</u></p> <p style="">A majority of the personally identifiable information we receive comes directly from our users who are interested in obtaining information on technologies or services provided by DTS. Typically this data includes your name, email address(es), mailing address(es), telephone number(s), and in certain instances, business details. We may also collect information such as age, gender and personal interests, which we may associate with personally identifiable information. </p> <p style=""><u style="">Information Collected Through Technology</u></p> <p style="">We also collect information through technology in order to enhance a users experience while on our website. We use technology that many other websites employ, including, “cookies” which are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website, which can collect, and actually do collect anonymous traffic data, together with specific information such as your IP address, Internet service provider, and the date and time you access our websites. The information collected by the use of cookies and other technical methods does not, in general, allow us to personally identify a user of the DTS website. Although in theory the information collected by such methods could be utilized to identify individual users, DTS does not possess the expertise necessary nor the desire to use such information for this purpose. Cookies and other technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. Our website does not require the use of cookies and a user may disable this browser setting at anytime. </p> <h3 style="">Use of Your Personal Information</h3> <p style="">Personally identifiable information gathered under this Privacy Policy is used to improve the operation of our website and services provided to its users. These uses may include researching and analyzing user preferences and website usage, identification of system or server problems and as an analytical tool aimed at improving our products, services and technologies.</p> <h3 style="">Where We Store and Process Data</h3> <p style="">Personally identifiable information collected on our website may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which DTS or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. </p> <h3 style="">Sharing of Your Personal Information</h3> <p style="">Except as detailed in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personal information outside of DTS and its subsidiary and affiliated entities without your prior consent. We do enlist the services of external companies to assist with the processing and delivery of mailings, the hosting of websites, the monitoring of social networks, and the processing of transactions. These service providers are only permitted access to the personally identifiable information required to perform a specific task and must maintain such data in strict confidence. We may retrieve and/or disclose personally identifiable information about a user; (1) if compelled by law, or (2) in response to a request from a law enforcement official in connection with a court proceeding, or (3) with a third party involved in an actual or prospective sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of our business.</p> <h3 style="">Opt-Out</h3> <p style="">You always have a choice on how your personally identifiable information is used by DTS. You may decide whether you wish to receive product, service, or technology information from us, and whether your information is used in programs or promotions. We will ask you prior to utilizing any of your personally identifiable information in programs or promotions whether you object to such use. If you do not wish your information to be used in such a manner or to opt-out of receiving product, service, or technology information, or to unsubscribe from services, such as licensee resources, please contact us at one of the following email addresses; to opt-out of professional audio related programs, please email <a href="mailto:proaudioinfo@dts.com" style="outline: none;" hidefocus="true">proaudioinfo@dts.com</a>; to opt-out of consumer licensing related programs, please email <a href="mailto:licensingadministration@dts.com" style="outline: none;" hidefocus="true">licensingadministration@dts.com</a>; to opt-out of content programs, please email <a href="mailto:content-us@dts.com" style="outline: none;" hidefocus="true">content-us@dts.com</a>.

We review these security measures from time to time and evaluate new technologies or approaches that would further enhance the security measures currently in place. Please be informed that despite our best efforts, no security measures are impenetrable. We ask that you safeguard any password or User ID obtained for use on our website as these are personal to each user and link to personally identifiable information. Each user takes full responsibility for any misuse or unauthorized use of our website via your password and User ID.</p> <h3 style="">Collection and Use of Children’s Personal Information</h3> <p style="">Our website is for use by adults in the United States and although we do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we request that individuals under the age of 13 not submit any personal information on our website.</p> <p style=""><strong style="">Enforcement of This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p style="">If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:DTSLegalPrivacy@dts.com" style="outline: none;" hidefocus="true">DTSLegalPrivacy@dts.com</a>.</p> <h3 style="">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3> <p style="">DTS may revise this Privacy Policy at any time.

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you where appropriate, or by means of a notice on our home page. You should bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure that you are familiar with the most current version of this Privacy Policy.
