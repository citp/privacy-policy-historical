### Privacy on Dixons

Is shopping online with Dixons safe?

At Dixons, we care about security and make every effort to ensure our transaction process is safe and that your personal information is secure.

We can assure you that every order you make on our website is safe. We use strict security precautions to make our website safe, including the use of a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) server. Any information you enter while you're using the secure server is encrypted before being transmitted, so it is virtually impossible for an outside party to access or intercept your information.

You can check that you are shopping in a secure environment by looking for either a locked padlock icon or an image of a key in the bar at the bottom of your screen. Additionally, your web address should start with https: - the ‘s’ indicating it is a secure page. This should appear on any page where you are entering personal information, such as your payment card details.

The latest versions of the most popular browsers, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari and Firefox support this secure connection. If for any reason this option has been disabled on your browser, you will not be able to transact or login until you reset these options. Find this option in your browser settings under security.

How do you protect my credit card details and personal information?

Our website is verified by Norton Secure, powered by Verisign to protect your personal data. Your payment methods are also covered through MasterCard Secure Code or Verified by Visa.

For your additional security and to protect your personal information we request that you enter your password each time you wish to view a page containing your personal details.

You can enrol your card in MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa scheme if you are not already a part of them. You will be able to set a private code for online transactions, giving you added protection against the unauthorised use of your credit or debit card online.

The full details of our Privacy Policy are below in our official Privacy Policy. This policy will explain all about what information we collect from you, how we use that information and your rights around retrieving or removing any information we hold in relation to you, as well as our complete guide to the use of cookies on our website.

(2) Data which allows us to recognise you, your preferences and how you use this website. This saves you from re-entering information when you return to the site. This data is collected by cookies from your navigation around the site. A complete guide to our cookies policy and how to control cookies on your computer can be found [here](http://www.dixons.co.uk/gbuk/privacy-on-dixons-318-commercial.html#tab-2).

(2) to carry out security checks (this may involve passing your details to our Identity Verification partner, currently 192.com, who will check details we give them against public and private databases - this helps to protect you and us from fraudulent transactions); and

We are a subsidiary of Dixons Retail plc and we may need to pass the information we collect to other companies within our group for administrative purposes. We may use third parties to carry out certain activities, such as processing and sorting data, monitoring how customers use our site and issuing our emails for us.
