        The following statement explains our policy regarding the personal information we collect about you.</p>
      <h2 align="justify"> Introduction</h2>
      <p align="justify">This policy covers the  dineshbakshi.com's use of personal information      that dineshbakshi.com collects when you use dineshbakshi.com. The policy also gives      you information about cookies; dineshbakshi.com and third parties' use of cookies;      and how you may reject such cookies.</p>
      <p align="justify">By  entering your details in the fields requested, you enable the dineshbakshi.com  and its service providers to provide you with the services you select.  Whenever you provide such personal information, we will treat that  information in accordance with this policy. When using your personal  information the dineshbakshi.com will act in accordance with current  legislation and aim to meet current Internet best practice.</p>
      <h2 align="justify">Visitor Information</h2>
      <p align="justify">During the course of any visit to dineshbakshi.com, the pages      you see, along with a short text file called a 'cookie' may be downloaded      to your computer. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers      to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its      user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking      to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.</p>
      <p align="justify">Information supplied by cookies can help us to provide you      with a better online user experience. For example: if on a previous visit      you went to our forum, we might find this out from your cookie and let you      use it without logging in. </p>
      <h2 align="justify">What is a cookie?</h2>
      <p align="justify">A  cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous  unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's  computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can  send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow  it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site  to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent  to you by other sites.</p>
      <p align="justify">Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.</p>
      <p align="justify">Cookies  record information about your online preferences. Users have the  opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify  them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time.  The last of these, of course, means that certain personalised services  cannot then be provided to that user user and accordingly you may not  be able to take full advantage of all of the dineshbakshi.com features.  Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to  learn how to change your cookie preferences.</p>
      <p align="justify">If  you have set your computer to reject cookies you can still browse  dineshbakshi.com anonymously. For further information on cookies please visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/">http://www.aboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
      <h2 align="justify">Use and storage of your personal information</h2>
      <p align="justify">When you supply any personal information to dineshbakshi.com      (e.g. for competitions, dineshbakshi.com services or dineshbakshi.com membership)      we have legal obligations towards you in the way we use those data. We must      collect the information fairly, that is, we must explain how we will use it      (see the notices on particular webpages that let you know why we are requesting      the information) and tell you if we want to pass the information on to anyone      else.</p>
      <p align="justify">In general, any information you provide to the  dineshbakshi.com      will only be used within the dineshbakshi.com and by its agents and service providers.      Your information will be disclosed where we are obliged or permitted by law.      Also, if you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content      anywhere on or to dineshbakshi.com or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour      on dineshbakshi.com, dineshbakshi.com can use whatever information that is available      to it about you to stop such behaviour. This may involve informing relevant      third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider and law      enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.</p>
      <p align="justify">We will hold your personal information on our systems for      as long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event      that the purpose has been met, or, in the case of dineshbakshi.com membership      you no longer wish to continue your registration as a dineshbakshi.com member.      For safety reasons, however, the dineshbakshi.com may store messaging transcript data      (including message content, member names, times and dates) arising from the      use of dineshbakshi.com services such as the quiz-maker for a period of six months.      Where personal information is held for people who are not yet registered but      have taken part in other dineshbakshi.com services (e.g. competitions), that information      will be held as long as is necessary to ensure that the service is run smoothly.      We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, in      accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
      <p align="justify">If you are notified on the dineshbakshi.com site that your information      may be used to allow the dineshbakshi.com to contact you for "service administration      purposes", this means that the  dineshbakshi.com may contact you for a number of purposes      related to the service you have signed up for. For example, we may wish to      provide you with password reminders or notify you that the particular service      has been suspended for maintenance. We will not contact you for promotional      purposes, such as notifying you of improvements to the service or new services      on dineshbakshi.com unless you specifically agree to be contacted for such purposes      at the time you submit your information on the site, or at a later time if      you sign up specifically to receive such promotional information.</p>
      <div></div>
      <h2 align="justify">How to see your cookie code</h2>
      <p align="justify">Just  click on a cookie to open it. You'll see a short string of text and  numbers. The numbers are your identification card, which can only be  seen by the server that gave you the cookie. </p>
      <h2 align="justify">List of www.dineshbakshi.com cookies</h2>
      <p align="justify">This is a list of the main cookies that dineshbakshi.com sets,      and what each is used for:</p>
