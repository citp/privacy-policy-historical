# Dine.TO Privacy Policy

Dine.TO has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for Dine.TO.

**Information Automatically Logged**

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. 

**Cookies**  
Our Site uses cookies to keep track of your Hot List, and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

**Advertisers**  
We may use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by the ad company, and we do not have access to this information. 

**Forms**  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name, email, and postal address). Contact information from the registration forms is used to send information about our company, and to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

Our site may, in some cases, use an contact form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect contact information (like their email address). Contact information from the forms is used to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings.

**Contact Forms**  
Many of our establishment profile pages contain a link labelled "send mail" used to send comments to an establishment. Because the message is sent on Dine.TO's letterhead, we need to track potential abuse, therefore a copy of your e-mail is forwarded to Dine.TO's administrator, these copies are deleted after the message has been checked and we do not collect e-mail adresses.
