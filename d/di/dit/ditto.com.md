# Privacy Policy - Ditto

**Effective Date:** July 3, 2019

This Privacy Policy describes the policies of Ditto Technologies, Inc. (“we”, “our” or “us”) on the collection, use and disclosure of your (“you” or “your”) information in connection with your use of our products and services including https://ditto.com/ (collectively the “Site”).

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including any third party websites, services and applications that you elect to access through or in connection with the Site, or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. We cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those third parties and encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies before you access such services.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information you provide to us through the Site. If you choose to use our services pursuant to a separate agreement with us, the collection, use, and disclosure of any information provided to us under such agreement will be governed by such agreement.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [privacy@ditto.com](mailto:privacy@ditto.com).

## Information Collected

Our privacy policy is not to collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information, except as described below.

  * You may choose to contact us through the Site to receive more information about our services or job openings. To do so, we ask for your full name, email address, company name and phone number and we collect and store such information if you choose to provide it. Contacting us is voluntary, and we send emails only to those who first contact us.
  * In order to improve our services and learn about how users interact with our Site, we may automatically collect information such as your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. Some of this information may be collected using cookies and stored in log files. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser’s directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of our Site may not work properly. For more information, please review our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy).
  * You may choose to receive a demonstration of the Ditto services on the Site at https://ditto.com/demo/. To do so, we collect an image of you and ask for certain other information to run the demonstration.



We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of Ditto or our business partners, or email you about your use of the Site. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing [privacy@ditto.com](mailto:privacy@ditto.com).

Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Site. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Site and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Site does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Site and after you leave our Site.

## When and How We Disclose Information to Third Parties

We never share or sell your information to third parties for their own purposes. We may now or in the future contract with other companies to provide certain services to us, such as suppliers, payment processors and technology service providers, and we may need to give them access to information, such as your email address, in order for them to perform services for us. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any rights to use the information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

In addition, we may at times share aggregated and anonymized Site statistics with our partners and service providers so that we and they can understand how and how often people use our Site. We will never disclose Site statistics in a manner that would allow a third party to identify you individually without your express consent.

If we or our assets were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy. We do not currently have a parent company or any affiliates, but in the future we may and may share your information with them, but they will be subject to the same obligations set out in this policy.

We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (iii) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public.

## Security of Information

We store all of our information, including your personal information, using industry-standard techniques. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Internet, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. We do not guarantee or warrant that the techniques we employ will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store.

## Changes

If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by sending you an email or by way of a conspicuous posting on the Site. Any material changes will take effect for existing users thirty (30) days after we give such notice and will be immediately effective for new users. If you do not agree to any such changes, please do not continue to use the Site following the effective date of such change.

## What Choices Do I Have?

You may request deletion of your personal information by sending an email to [privacy@ditto.com](mailto:privacy@ditto.com).

## If You Have Questions or Concerns

_Non-U.S. Users:_ Please be advised that your information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal data may be less stringent than the laws in your country. If you have concerns about our processing of your personal data, please do not use the Site.

_California Privacy Rights:_ Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: [privacy@ditto.com](mailto:privacy@ditto.com).

## EU Residents

If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.

For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. We will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Site.

Where applicable, this section is intended to supplement, and not replace, our Privacy Policy. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at [privacy@ditto.com](mailto:privacy@ditto.com). Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of services to customers, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.
