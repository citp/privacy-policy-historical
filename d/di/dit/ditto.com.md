**Privacy Policy**

It is Ditto's policy to allow our customers to provide as much - or as little - personal information to us as they feel comfortable doing. As a user of Ditto, you control what personal information is collected, control what Ditto can do with the information, and have a guarantee of privacy. As a company, Ditto believes strongly in protecting consumer privacy.

Ditto does not assign any "cookies" for the purpose of tracking users. Ditto does employ session cookies for the specific purpose of enabling users to optionally set specific viewing or content preferences for a session. Session cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any user. Unless you specifically tell us, Ditto will never know who you are.

**Collected Information**

Companies that advertise on our site may have the ability to assign a cookie to you in a process that Ditto does not control. However, since cookies aren't useable for identifying individuals, these advertisers will never know who you are - and Ditto will never reveal that information to them.

**Use of Information**

Ditto always tries to provide you with a compelling reason to come back and visit our site again. We continually analyze what our customers like and don't like about Ditto's current offerings so that we can design better services. We use information about what you are searching for to help focus our energies on the services we offer, hopefully to make them more valuable to you.

We develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be 10,000 people clicked on Advertisement "X" today. The people that make it possible for you to use Ditto for free - our advertisers - rely on this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. We never tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have specifically told us this is acceptable.

**Third-Party Relationships**

You will find direct links on our site to other web sites.  These sites are not under the control of Ditto and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.  If you have any concerns that a site to which we have a direct link is not practicing an acceptable policy please contact them directly.

When you are on Ditto, advertisers and/or our partners may place their own cookies on your computer, even if you remain solely on the Ditto site. Ditto does not control the use of the information obtained through the cookies these parties send. If you have questions or concerns regarding cookies sent to you by companies other than Ditto, we encourage you to contact those companies directly.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

Ditto sites may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with legal process served on Ditto, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Ditto, the site or the users of Ditto, and (c) act under certain extenuating circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Ditto, the site or the public.

Thank you for visiting Ditto.
