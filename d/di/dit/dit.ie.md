**What are cookies?**

A cookie is a small text file that a website can store on your computer to help keep track of different things, like if you want to stay logged into a website, or your preferences within a website. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Cookies may be persistent, they may expire after some predefined period of time, or they may expire at a given date in the future. When a user visits the same website again, the browser may send cookies back to that website allowing the website to recognise the user and remember things like their personalised details or preferences.

A website may use a third party advertising network to deliver targeted advertising on their website, which may also have the capability to track your browsing activity across different sites. This website does not use this type of cookie.

**Session cookies**

Session cookies are stored temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted from the user’s device when the browser is closed.

**Persistent cookies**

This type of cookie is saved on your computer for a fixed period and is not deleted when the browser is closed.
