# Privacy Policy

**What information do we collect?**

We may ask for your name, telephone number, home address, email address and age for competitions, prizedraws, or to sign up to our newsletter. We also ask for delivery address and payment method details when you make a purchase on our site. We may obtain information about usage of our Website to help us develop and improve it further through online surveys and other requests.

**What the data will be used for?**

Your data will enable us, and our processors, to fulfil your order, to notify you about important functionality changes and for statistical or survey purposes to improve this Website and our services to you. We will also send you email information about products and services, and details of promotions and special offers from Diffusion. If you do not wish to be contacted for these purposes, you can unsubscribe by clicking the link at the bottom of any of our emails to you. In assessing your request for goods or services, we may use your information for the purposes of the prevention and detection of fraud. In certain situations we may ask customers to provide extra details such as a scan of a recent utility bill. This is a precautionary check that we carry out and if you fail to provide the details requested then we will not process your order. Details provided will be used to check your identity only, and will be destroyed immediately after use. Quest Retail (trading as Diffusion) complies to the Data Protection Act 1998 (the "Act"). We comply with the standards, procedures and requirements laid down in the Act to ensure that the personal information you give us is kept secure and processed fairly and lawfully.

**What information do we share with others?**

We may contract with other companies to provide certain services, including credit card processing, shipping, name and address verification, market research and promotions management. We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services and work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected. These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Diffusion. We will not pass your information on to any other companies or other third parties for marketing purposes unless you have agreed for us to do so. One of the purposes for which we may disclose your address and post code details is to check against the Sagepay Security Alert or any other Fraud Prevention Scheme. We may also disclose specific information upon governmental request, or when required by law to do so. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.
