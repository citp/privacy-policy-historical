COOKIES AND TRACKING

We use both session-based and persistent cookies.  

Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser.  

Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.  They are unique and allow us to collect site analytics and to customize a Subscriber's experience.  If you access our Site through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings.

In order to collect Tracking Information, make your use of the Site and Service more efficient and responsive to your needs, Diffbot and its cookie service providers, detailed in the [Cookie Policy](https://www.diffbot.com/cookies), store cookies on your computer.  Diffbot also uses cookies and web beacons that are placed in web pages on the Site(s) and Services to collect information and learn about actions users take when they interact with the Site and Service.

### HOW DO WE USE YOUR DATA?  

TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES

SUBSCRIBER(S)

Subscriber data is used to provide the Service; process Service payments; facilitate support queries and requests.  A Subscriber's failure to provide the personal data we need, may result in our inability to complete the transaction or provide the service.

SEARCH SUBJECT(S)

We do not control what information is collected by Subscribers or their purpose for use. To the extent any notices or consents are required, Subscribers are solely responsible for giving such notices or obtaining such consents.  We do not use your personal data for activities where we believe that your interests are overridden by any unwarranted adverse impact on you.

Diffbot's primary role is to discover, categorize, and extract information on the Internet on behalf of, and as directed by, our Subscriber(s).  Diffbot subscribers can use our service and query functionality to create their own lists of Search Subjects; add their own data about Search Subjects (which only they can access); and monitor Search Subjects: communications; employments, websites, social media presence, links (etc.).

We allow our Subscribers access to search results via our online platform(s) and/or API service(s) to enable our subscribers to view information the Subscribers may be interested in.

A Subscriber can submit a query using the Diffbot UI or API to access data collected and indexed from the Internet. Diffbot then returns a list of items or subjects and a custom data set is created (a list of entities, related entities and facts) that matches the Subscriber's search criteria. A Subscriber may also define the data to extract from a specific web page, a group of pages or domain by accessing a suite of extraction APIs, by extending an existing extraction API, or by creating a new API using custom rules which yields extracted data.

The main purpose for using your personal data is to create a repository of data regarding persons entities and make that data available to our subscribers on a fee basis.  Your personal data may also be processed in one or more of the following ways:

Our customers can search the database via our online platform(s);

  * Subscribers can create lists of Individuals' websites

  * Subscribers can export data from our query tool provided the data is used in accordance with all applicable laws and in accordance with our terms of use.

  * Some of our Subscribers can purchase wholesale access but only if they agree to use it in compliance with the law.




Please see Profiling and Tracking to see how your data is used for profiling and tracking.

LEGITIMATE INTERESTS

### Aggregation of Search Subject data is beneficial to you because it will allow the Subscriber to receive targeted information that may be of interest or use for due diligence, job search or other evaluation or research purposes;.  

### VALIDATING ACCESS TO CONTENT

SUBSCRIBERS

For Subscribers, we use the Personal Data of Subscribers (i.e. login; passwords, API tokens) to validate their right to use our Services.

SEARCH SUBJECTS  

We will use Personal Data of Search Subjects to validate their identities in connection with the exercise of an EU (or other applicable jurisdiction's) data subject's rights or in the case of non-EU data subjects not subject to such legally required rights, to validate their identities prior to processing any removal or update requests.

### DIRECT MARKETING

SUBSCRIBERS

Customers can opt out of receiving marketing materials via email or mail at any time while receiving the Service.  If you receive email, newsletter or marketing communications from us and no longer wish to receive them, please follow the removal instructions in the email or change your account settings.

SEARCH SUBJECTS

We do not market to Search Subjects or commercially sell data not otherwise publicly available.

TRACKING AND PROFILING FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE PURPOSES, STATISTICAL AND TO FULFILL OBLIGATIONS TO OUR SUBSCRIBERS.

SUBSCRIBERS

Subscriber tracking is used to improve the Services and Site and includes:  length of use; time and date service was used; search queries; API requests; and how the service was accessed (app; desktop; phone)

SEARCH SUBJECTS

We and third-party service providers may collect certain tracking information about your personal data for automated aggregation, indexing, and/or categorization purposes.  The aggregation/categorization/indexing is limited and collected from the public domain; i.e. collected from information you publish on the internet and make public. For example, we catalog your subject matter expertise, interests, employments, education, and skills, and make this information available to our customers in response to Subscribers' particular queries they make when using our service.  While we do not have the means to contact the millions of Search Subjects indexed through crawling, we will honor applicable data subject rights requests subject to our confirmation of your identity.

DATA SUBJECT PROFILING

We combine the personal data and information from publicly available websites and present this information to our Subscribers via our Service.  Our Subscribers are able to search publicly accessible sources using APIs or a search dashboard. This allows our Customers to do due diligence on Individuals with whom they wish to build a business relationship or collect and use data for other legitimate purposes.

We also offer a service that uses APIs to structure hundreds or thousands of web pages into a single, searchable index. In doing so, the Subscriber may collect and create profiles containing Personal Data.

Targeting

Our Subscribers can understand your subject matter expertise, areas of interest, services offered, or subjects you are interested in thereby allowing our Subscriber(s) to target Search Subjects or other search criteria.  

View and Evaluate Your Content

Via our service, a Subscriber can search and categorize your content, which may be given an automatically generated "relevance" score or be categorized/labeled, by Diffbot's technology; The Subscriber can extract data from the aggregated data that matches their query or create graphs based on the indexes they build.   

Automated Decision-making

We use automated techniques such as visual layout analysis and classification, computer vision, text analytics, machine learning, and knowledge fusion to identify and classify data, extract and understand data on webpages which can be used to develop algorithms for even more robust automation.  Diffbot does not use the output of automated data processing as the sole basis for any decisions regarding a Search Subject.
