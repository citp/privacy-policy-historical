###  What information are we going to collect from you? 

1\. The types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a student, parent/guardian or teacher and how users use the Site. 

2\. Where we collect information directly from a student under the age of 16, we will also ask for a parent/guardian email address from the student so we can seek verifiable parental/guardian consent to the collection and processing of the student’s personal data. In cases, however, where we collect personal data in respect of students from their teachers or schools, we will rely on the authority of the teachers or schools to provide such data to us and will not seek to obtain separate parental/guardian consent to the collection and processing of such students’ personal data. 

3\. **Information you give us** by filling in forms on our Site, using our service or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you register to use our Site, subscribe to and use our service, and you report a problem with our Site.

5\. **Information we receive from other sources** , such as information we receive about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide. In this case we will have informed you when we collected that data if we intend to share those data internally and combine it with data collected on our Site. We will also have told you for what purpose we will share and combine your data. We are working closely with third parties (including, for example, Wonde (which integrates with school management information systems to provide teacher, student and parent/guardian information), business partners, analytics providers and search information providers).
