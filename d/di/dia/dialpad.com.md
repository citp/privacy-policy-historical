**Cookies**

Our web site uses cookies to manage Dialpad call sessions, provide customizable and personalized services and enhance your web viewing experience.  Cookies are user-specific data that a web server sends to you and are stored on your computer.  Cookies are created by the web server or the Java script in the HTML. When you visit Dialpad, cookies will be sent to your web browser by a web server, which can be later read by that server. We use cookies to: 

  1. Keep track of your session ID and user name.
  2. Display your phonebook and logbook.
  3. Estimate the audience size of the Dialpad web site.
  4. Measure certain aggregated traffic patterns of the Dialpad web site to enhance our service.



We use cookies only for these objectives.  Cookies cannot be used to get data from your hard drive, your email or any other personal data about you.  We do not ask if you accept cookies or not on our web site.  However, if you set your web browser to not accept cookies, you cannot use our service. 

**Information Dialpad Gathers and Tracks**

We collect IP addresses to administer our web site and diagnose problems.  Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information.  In addition, we collect information regarding log times, call durations, call numbers, country code and region code of our users for internal data analyses only.  Such web site usage information is not personally identifiable information. 

Our web site's registration form asks for contact information (such as name and email address), by which you can be personally identified, and demographic information (such as zip code, age, and income level).  If you purchase products or services on our web site, you will be asked for financial information, such as account or credit card numbers.  We do not target our services to individuals less than age 13, and will not collect personal information from children under 13 without parental consent.  You may also choose on the registration page or your account page to permit Dialpad to share your member ID with other Dialpad users. 

We use reputable outside advertising companies to display advertisements on our web site.  These advertisements contain cookies.  While we use cookies in other parts of our web site, cookies received with ads are collected by our advertising companies; as such, we do not have access to this information and they are not subject to our privacy policy. 

**How Dialpad Uses Information**

We use contact information from your registration form to send information to you about Dialpad and, with your permission, to send promotional information from Dialpad and/or its partners.  The contact information is also used to contact you when necessary about issues concerning the use of our service.  If you have provided credit card information, we will not use your credit card information for any purpose other than for processing payments.  We reserve the right to also use personally identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity that threatens either Dialpad or any company affiliated with Dialpad.  Moreover, upon the appropriate request of a government agency, law enforcement, court or as otherwise required by law, Dialpad may disclose personally identifiable information. 

We use demographic and web site usage information internally to improve the products and services we provide to you.  Unless you have opted-out as specified below, we reserve the right to share it with third party marketing partners to help us improve how we serve you and to alert you to new products, services and special offers.  If you choose to receive promotional materials from Dialpad and/or its partners, you will be giving Dialpad permission to access your information on behalf of pre-screened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.  We will not share your personal information with our partners unless you have opted to receive promotional emails from Dialpad and its partners on our site.  Some of our partners and affiliates provide services for direct marketing applications including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation.  In some situations, we will also share your personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending emails; however, these parties are not allowed to use personal information except for the limited purpose of providing the particular service on our behalf. 

On occasion it may be necessary for Dialpad to send out a strictly service related announcement.  For instance, if our service will be temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send you an email to that effect.  You may not opt-out of these communications, although you can deactivate your account.  However, these communications are not promotional in nature 

**Choice/Opt-In**

Our web site provides you with the opportunity to opt-in to receive important updates regarding the Dialpad service at the point where we request information about you.  Our web site also provides you with the opportunity to opt-in to receive promotional materials from Dialpad and/or its partners at such point.  If you choose not to opt-in to receive communications from Dialpad, you shall not receive future communications. 

If you choose to receive communications from Dialpad and/or its partners, Dialpad provides you the ability to remove your information from our database so as not to receive future communications or to no longer receive our service by sending an email to [delist@dialpad.com](mailto:delist@dialpad.com).  You may also follow the instructions contained in any promotional email to unsubscribe from receiving future promotional emails.

**Surveys and Sweepstakes**

From time to time, our web site requests information from users via surveys or sweepstakes.  Participation in these surveys or sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address) and demographic information (such as age and zip code).  Contact information will be used to notify sweepstakes winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for the purpose of monitoring or improving your use of, and satisfaction with, this web site.

Dialpad maintains high security measures to protect your information from loss, misuse or alteration.  Information that we collect from you will be stored and backed up securely in an environmentally-controlled location.  Only authorized people with user ID and password from Dialpad have access to the database. 

**Co-Branded Web Sites**

We sometimes enter into arrangements with third parties whereby we provide our services on their web sites.  In many such cases, users will register for our service as well as that of the co-branded web site.  We use your personally identifiable information and other general information in compliance with our privacy policy.  Our co-branding partners have their own privacy policy, which you should review since we do not have control over their privacy policies.
