# Privacy Policy: American Diabetes Association®

_Updated May 25, 2018_

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

### Collection and Use of Personal Information

**What is Personal Data?**

Personal Data (also referred to in this policy as Personal Information) means any information relating to a natural person who can be identified by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification/account number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that person.  
**  
Personal Information We Collect**

When you visit the ADA Websites, there are five types of information you might provide to us: contact information you knowingly choose to disclose; registration information when registering for an event, billing information when you donate, join, subscribe, or make a purchase; demographic or other information about you; and technical information collected by us as you interact with our websites.

**Contact Information**

In some areas of the ADA Websites, we request that you provide personal information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.

**Donor and Purchaser Information**

In some areas of the ADA Websites, we request that you provide your credit card number, contact information, and other billing information. **

Registration Information

**

In some areas of the ADA Websites, we request that you provide personal information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.

**Demographic Information**

In some areas of the ADA Websites, we collect demographic information such as your age, career, preferences, gender, educational degrees, ethnic background, interests, and diabetes affiliation. Sometimes, we may collect a combination of information types. Examples of areas of the ADA Websites where we may collect personal or combined personal and demographic data are pages where you can donate to the ADA, sign up to be a member (professional or general), register for a program or event, or purchase a product.

**Technical Information**

We also may gather certain information about your use of our site, such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware and software that we may collect. This information can include, without limitation, your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website addresses. Some of this information is collected through the use of cookies (described below).

### Use of Personal Information

The information collected may be used by ADA for the purpose of providing you with the content you request, operating and improving the ADA Websites, providing a positive user experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer. 

We may also use the information we gather to inform you of other products or services available from the ADA Websites or to contact you about your opinion of current products and services or potential new products and services that may be offered. 

We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail, postal mail, or other communications regarding updates at the ADA, such as newsletters, diabetes information, event and programmatic information, and additional listings which may be of interest to you. We may also use it to send you information about third-party products and services that match your interests and preferences, if you opt in for this communication. The nature and frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information we have about you. In addition, at the time of registration for certain services, you have the option to elect to receive additional communications, information, newsletters, and promotions relating to topics that may be of special interest to you. 

If in the future we intend to process your Personal Data for a purpose other than that for which it was collected, we will provide you with information on that purpose and any other relevant information including the option to opt out. 

Part of our mission is to improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes, and we do that by providing appropriate information. We do not provide your name and address or email to outside parties, except as described here.

Click here for more information about the Google Analytics [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).

We collect standard information, by way of a cookie, to help us evaluate how our sites are being used. A cookie is a small uniquely identifiable text file that is stored on your machine. A cookie collects information that is used for statistical purposes and does not identify you in any way.

Our sites use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same content repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver information specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

### Protecting Personal Information

We are concerned with protecting your privacy and data. When you make a donation, register for an event or program, place orders, access your account information or request information, we use a secure server. This secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all customer transactional data we collect is protected against unauthorized access with the use of digital certificates. Digital certificates for the American Diabetes Association are issued by VeriSign, one of the most established signers of digital certificates.

We provide reasonable technical, administrative, and physical controls to secure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal information. If you have any questions about security on the ADA Websites, you may contact us at [dataprotection@diabetes.org](mailto:dataprotection@diabetes.org).

### Payment Processing

All credit transactions occur in a secure area of our site to protect you from any loss, misuse, or alteration of information collected. When you make a donation, subscribe or place an order online at any of the ADA Websites, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption of web content using Transport Layer Security.

### Association Policies Regarding Disclosure of Personal Information

ADA, like many other non-profit organizations, occasionally makes available only our contributor names and postal addresses to companies, predominantly other non-profit organizations. In addition, member and donor names are provided to a credit card vendor as part of our affinity program. Names of Tour de Cure® participants may be provided to local bike shops. These practices help us reduce costs of reaching more individuals with our diabetes-related information. These companies are carefully screened. 

Names/addresses are provided on a one-time basis; therefore, these companies will not have continued access to your name and address unless you respond to them directly, which you are free to do or not to do. 

You can request that we do not share, sell, or exchange your information for third party's fundraising or marketing purposes by emailing us at [privacy@diabetes.org](mailto:%20privacy@diabetes.org). (If you use more than one email address, postal address or telephone number, please identify each one.) The American Diabetes Association may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal identifying information.

### Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. We adhere to the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). For more information, visit the Federal Trade Commission's [COPPA site](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy).

### Notification Guidelines

The Association does not send unsolicited commercial communications to individuals with whom they do not have consent/permission or a pre-existing or current business relationship. The Association provides all notified recipients with a clear, easy and effective method to unsubscribe to any and all online communications.
