						your computer.&nbsp; Cookies are created by the web server or the Java script in the HTML. When you visit Dialpad,
						cookies will be sent to your web browser by a web server, which can be later read by that server. We use cookies to:

						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Information Dialpad Gathers and Tracks</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						We collect IP addresses to administer our web site and diagnose problems.&nbsp; Your IP address is also used to
						gather broad demographic information.&nbsp; In addition, we collect information regarding log times, call durations,
						call numbers, country code and region code of our users for internal data analyses only.&nbsp; Such web site usage
						information is not personally identifiable information.
						</p>
						<p>
						Our web site's registration form asks for contact information (such as name and email address), by which you can be
						personally identified, and demographic information (such as zip code, age, and income level).&nbsp; If you purchase
						products or services on our web site, you will be asked for financial information, such as account or credit card
						numbers.&nbsp; We do not target our services to individuals less than age 13, and will not collect personal
						information from children under 13 without parental consent.&nbsp; You may also choose on the registration page
						or your account page to permit Dialpad to share your member ID with other Dialpad users.
						</p>
						<p>
						We use reputable outside advertising companies to display advertisements on our web site.&nbsp; These advertisements
						contain cookies.&nbsp; While we use cookies in other parts of our web site, cookies received with ads are collected
						by our advertising companies; as such, we do not have access to this information and they are not subject to our
						privacy policy.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>How Dialpad Uses Information</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						We use contact information from your registration form to send information to you about Dialpad and, with your
						permission, to send promotional information from Dialpad and/or its partners.&nbsp; The contact information is
						also used to contact you when necessary about issues concerning the use of our service.&nbsp; If you have provided
						credit card information, we will not use your credit card information for any purpose other than for processing
						payments.&nbsp; We reserve the right to also use personally identifiable information to investigate and help
						prevent potentially unlawful activity that threatens either Dialpad or any company affiliated with Dialpad.&nbsp;
						Moreover, upon the appropriate request of a government agency, law enforcement, court or as otherwise required by
						law, Dialpad may disclose personally identifiable information. 
						</p>
						<p>
						We use demographic and web site usage information internally to improve the products and services we provide to you.&nbsp;
						Unless you have opted-out as specified below, we reserve the right to share it with third party marketing partners to
						help us improve how we serve you and to alert you to new products, services and special offers.&nbsp; If you choose to
						receive promotional materials from Dialpad and/or its partners, you will be giving Dialpad permission to access your
						information on behalf of pre-screened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.&nbsp; We will not share your
						personal information with our partners unless you have opted to receive promotional emails from Dialpad and its partners
						on our site.&nbsp; Some of our partners and affiliates provide services for direct marketing applications including
						lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation.&nbsp;
						In some situations, we will also share your personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform
						a particular service on our behalf, such as sending emails; however, these parties are not allowed to use personal
						information except for the limited purpose of providing the particular service on our behalf.
						</p>
						<p>
						On occasion it may be necessary for Dialpad to send out a strictly service related announcement.&nbsp;
						For instance, if our service will be temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send you an email
						to that effect.&nbsp; You may not opt-out of these communications, although you can deactivate your
						account.&nbsp; However, these communications are not promotional in nature
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Choice/Opt-In</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						Our web site provides you with the opportunity to opt-in to receive important updates regarding the Dialpad service at
						the point where we request information about you.&nbsp; Our web site also provides you with the opportunity to opt-in
						to receive promotional materials from Dialpad and/or its partners at such point.&nbsp; If you choose not to opt-in to
						receive communications from Dialpad, you shall not receive future communications.
						</p>
						<p>
						If you choose to receive communications from Dialpad and/or its partners, Dialpad provides you the ability to remove
						your information from our database so as not to receive future communications or to no longer receive our service by
						sending an email to <a href="mailto:delist@dialpad.com">delist@dialpad.com</a>.&nbsp; You may also follow the instructions contained in any promotional email
						to unsubscribe from receiving future promotional emails.

						<strong>Surveys and Sweepstakes</strong>

						<p>
						Dialpad maintains high security measures to protect your information from loss, misuse or alteration.&nbsp;
						Information that we collect from you will be stored and backed up securely in an environmentally-controlled
						location.&nbsp; Only authorized people with user ID and password from Dialpad have access to the database.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Co-Branded Web Sites</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						We sometimes enter into arrangements with third parties whereby we provide our services on their web sites.&nbsp;
