            In some cases our Ad Network will place clear gifs on our site in order to track the effectiveness

            identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
            In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded
            invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. This

						<p><strong>Information Dialpad Gathers and Tracks</strong></p>
						<p>
							We collect IP addresses to administer our website and diagnose 
              problems. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic 
              information. In addition, we collect information regarding log times, 
              call duration, call numbers, country code and region code of our 
              users for internal data analyses only. Such website usage information 
              is not personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable 
              information is data about you that distinguishes you specifically 
              such as first name and last name, email address, postal address, 
              etc.
						</p>

						
            <p>Our website's registration process asks for contact information 
              (such as name and email address), by which you can be personally 
              identified. When you purchase products or services on our website, 
              you will be asked for financial information, such as account or 
              credit card numbers, as well as billing verification information, 
              such as billing address. </p>
						
            <p>We do not target our services to children under the age of 18. 
              We do not collect personal information from children under the age 
              of 18 without parental consent. Minors under the age of 18 can only 
              use our service with parental consent.</p>
            <p>Dialpad values you as a customer and works diligently to protect 
              your information. The information that you provide is never sold 
              to third parties.</p>
						<p><strong>How Dialpad Uses Information</strong></p>
						<p>
						We use contact information from your registration form to contact 
              you when necessary about issues concerning the use of our service. 
              We collect and remember feedback that you provide to us, in order 
              to troubleshoot in the event that you contact our customer support 
              department.
						</p>
			  
            <p>We use demographic and website usage information internally to 
              improve the products and services we provide to you.</p>
            <p>If you have provided credit card information, we will not use your 
              credit card information for any purpose other than for processing payments.
              We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services.
              This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable
              information for any other purposes other than as described herein.
              </p>
            <p>We reserve the right to also use personally identifiable information 
              to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity that 
              threatens either Dialpad, any company affiliated with Dialpad or 
              the general public. Moreover, upon the appropriate request of a 
              government agency, law enforcement, court or as otherwise required 
              by law, Dialpad may disclose personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p>We may send information to you from time to time regarding improvements 
              to our services, or about new benefits related to your account. Also, 
              on occasion it may be necessary for Dialpad to send out a service 
              related announcement.&nbsp; For instance, if our service will be temporarily 
              suspended for maintenance, we may send you an email to that effect. 
              You may not opt-out of these service related communications that 
              enable us to provide information regarding service.
            </p>
						<p>
						<strong>Choice/Opt-In</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						You may choose to visit our website and not provide any information. 
              If you do not provide any information to us, we will not have any 
              information from you other than the information that the cookies 
              send to your computer. If your cookies are turned off, we will not 
              have any of your information but you will not be able to use our 
              service.
						</p>
            <p>During the period between October 1999 and January 2003, Dialpad 
              allowed its users to 'opt in' on our registration form to receive 
              promotional emails from Dialpad and our partners.&nbsp; At that time, 
              users were given the ability to 'opt in' and to then complete a survey 
              form that asked for specific demographic information.&nbsp; This information 
              has been shared with reputable third parties.&nbsp; If you were a Dialpad 
              user during this time and are receiving emails from any of these partners or
              from Dialpad and you wish to unsubscribe from their services, please follow
              the instructions contained in any promotional email to unsubscribe from
              receiving future promotional emails.&nbsp; In addition, please send an
              email to <a href="mailto:privacy@dialpad.com">privacy@dialpad.com</a>
              and include the email address to which you are receiving email and you will be
              removed from the Dialpad database and will not be included in any future data
              exchanges between Dialpad and our third party marketing partners.&nbsp;
              Any email that is coming to you as a result of your having registered with
              Dialpad during that time period should have a clear and working link to allow
              you to unsubscribe; please report any such emails that do not to
              <a href="mailto:privacy@dialpad.com">privacy@dialpad.com</a>.
            </p>
						<p><strong>How Dialpad Protects Your Information</strong></p>
						<p>
						Dialpad maintains high security measures to protect your information 
              from loss, misuse or alteration. Information that we collect from 
              you will be stored and backed up securely in an environmentally-controlled 
              location. Only authorized people with user ID and password from 
              Dialpad have access to the database.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Surveys and Sweepstakes</strong></p>
						<p>
						From time to time, our website requests information from users 
              via surveys or sweepstakes. Participation in these surveys or sweepstakes 
              is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether 
              or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include 
              contact information (such as name and address) and demographic information 
              (such as age and zip code). Contact information will be used to 
              notify sweepstakes winners and award prizes. Survey information 
              will be used for the purpose of monitoring or improving your use 
              of, and satisfaction with, this website.
						</p>
			  		<p><strong>Public Forums</strong></p>
						<p>
						From time to time, our website may contain public forums available 
              to users. Please remember that any information you disclose in these 
              areas becomes public information. You should take appropriate measures 
              to protect your personally identifiable information.
						</p>			
						<p><strong>Co-Branded Websites</strong></p>
						<p>
						We sometimes enter into arrangements with third parties whereby 
              we provide our services on their websites.&nbsp; In many such cases, 
              users will register for our service as well as that of the co-branded 
              website.&nbsp; We use your personally identifiable information and other 
              general information in compliance with this privacy policy.&nbsp; Our co-branding 
              partners have their own privacy policies, which you should review 
              since we do not have control over their privacy policies.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Email Links</strong></p>
						<p>
						This website uses email links on the "Contact Us" page 
              to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments 
              you may have.&nbsp; We review every message received and try to respond promptly
