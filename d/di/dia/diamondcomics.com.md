Currently, Diamond does not conduct surveys or in any other fashion collect information about visitors to its site. This web site does not use cookies or other means of tracking browsers. If this practice changes, this privacy statement will be updated to reflect that change.

Secured areas of our site occasionally use an order form for retail accounts and potential accounts to request information, products and services.

This information is used to send orders, information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer’s contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary.
