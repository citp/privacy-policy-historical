# Privacy Policy: American Diabetes Association®

_Updated November 20, 2009_

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

### 1\. Collection and Use of Personal Information

When you request information, order a product or service, register using one of our forms, donate, or contact us offline, we may need your specific information in order to process your registration/request and reply promptly.

We may ask you for contact information (such as your name, email and address) and demographic information (such as your zip code or age). We also collect demographic and profile data at our site and in our databases. We ask for health-related data to help us help you through our information, our programs and our services. We use data you provide to tailor your experience at ADA and develop and distribute content that we think you might be interested in.

In general, we use identifiable information to complete a transaction, as indicated below. Part of our mission is to improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes, and we do that by providing appropriate health information. We do not provide your name and address or email to outside parties, except as described here. To learn more about our encryption policies, please review the section on "Protecting Personal Information" (below).

### 2\. Links to Other Sites

This site may provide links to other World Wide Web sites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the American Diabetes Association has no control over such sites and resources and is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any Materials, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that the American Diabetes Association shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such Materials or goods available on or through any such site or resource.

### 3\. Monitoring of Information

We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the American Diabetes Association website. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important changes to the websites, new services or features offered by the American Diabetes Association, and special offers and information we think you will find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, please contact us through one of the channels identified in "How to Correct or Update Information" (below).

Google Analytics is used to analyze traffic to this website. Google Analytics does not maintain individual profiles for visitors, nor does Google Analytics collect data that might identify the individual visitor. Google Analytics only collects aggregate data. Click here for more information about the Google Analytics [privacy](http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/privacy.html) policy.

### 4\. Protecting Personal Information

When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. This secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer transactional data we collect is protected against unauthorized access with the use of digital certificates. Digital certificates for the American Diabetes Association are issued by VeriSign, one of the most established signers of digital certificates.

### 5\. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information and Cookies

We collect standard information, by way of a cookie, to help us evaluate how our sites are being used. A cookie is a small uniquely identifiable text file that is stored on your machine. A cookie collects information that is used for statistical purposes and does not identify you in any way.

Our sites use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same content repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver information specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to prevent that. Even without accepting cookies, you can still use most of the features throughout the American Diabetes Association websites.

Often times, we may use certain advertising networks and exchanges that participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain interest-based advertising delivered by NAI members’ ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). Please be aware that such opt-outs do not affect non-targeted ads. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out mechanisms or programs, or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

#### Association Policies Regarding Disclosure of Personal Information

ADA, like many other non-profit organizations, occasionally makes available only our contributor names and postal addresses to companies, predominantly other non-profit organizations. In addition, member and donor names are provided to a credit card vendor as part of our [affinity program](https://wwwa.applyonlinenow.com/USCCapp/Ctl/entry?directMail=true&sc=UAA78N). Names of Tour de Cure® participants may be provided to local bike shops. These practices help us reduce costs of reaching more individuals with our diabetes-related information. These companies are carefully screened.

Names/addresses are provided on a one-time basis; therefore, these companies will not have continued access to your name and address unless you respond to them directly, which you are free to do or not to do.

You can request that we do not share, sell, or exchange your information for third party's fundraising or marketing purposes by emailing us at [privacy@diabetes.org](mailto:privacy@diabetes.org). (If you use more than one email address , postal address or telephone number, please identify each one.) The American Diabetes Association may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal identifying information.

### 6\. Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. We adhere to the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). (For more information, visit the Federal Trade Commission's [COPPA site](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy).

#### Special Considerations for Parents and Legal Guardians Regarding Planet D and Diabetes CampMessage Boards

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. Children under age 13 are prohibited from entering the diabetes.org Message Board area.

PlanetD Message Boards: PlanetD is designed to be a safe place for children and youth to exchange messages. No personally identifiable information is collected during the PlanetD Message Board registration process.

Diabetes Camp Message Boards: Access to the Diabetes Camp Message Boards is controlled; only children and youth who have attended an [ADA sponsored, supported, or affiliated Diabetes Camp](http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/parents-and-kids/ada-camps/) are provided access. To ensure authentication, personally identifiable information (first name, last name, and a child's email address) are collected, along with the email address of a parent or legal guardian. This information is collected only for authentication purposes, and is securely stored, and never used for another purpose, and never shared with third-parties. It is our recommendation that children, especially children under 13, have an email account that is connected to their parent or guardian, so that the parent or guardian is notified about the child's email activity.

Parents and legal guardians are encouraged to contact the American Diabetes. Association at any time regarding privacy questions or concern. Parents and legal guardians may also contact us at any time to request that we delete a child's PlanetD-ID and/or CampDiabetes Message Board registration information and/or refuse to permit further access to the PlanetD and CampDiabetes Message Boards . We will take steps to ensure that any person contacting us for a child's information is that child's parent or guardian.
