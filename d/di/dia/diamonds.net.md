    * To subscribe to the Services, you must provide company details, address, phone number, and e-mail address. In order to trade through our INDEX-Internet Diamond Exchange or RapNet trading systems, you must provide trade references, credit card, debit card and bank account information.

2.2 Transaction Information   
When you list a diamond for sale, purchase or sell a diamond, or use the Services in any way, we record information related to each transaction, including the amount of the transaction. We retain this information for each of your transactions through Diamonds.Net. We also collect the Internet address (IP address) of the computer or device you use to access your Rapaport account, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorized transactions.

In order to protect us and our customers against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information you provide. In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. This may include background and credit checks by obtaining information about you and your business from a credit bureau or a business information service such as Dun & Bradstreet. If you incur a debt to Rapaport, we will generally conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, to the extent permitted by law. Rapaport, at its sole discretion, also reserves the right periodically to retrieve and review a business and / or consumer credit report for any account, and reserves the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit review process.

2.4 Additional Verification

We strictly enforce our Anti-Spam Policy. To report Rapaport-related spam to Rapaport, please contact us at [info@diamonds.net](mailto:info@diamonds.net).   

  

  4. Information Security

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.

If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please contact us immediately.
