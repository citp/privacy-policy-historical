**Tracking and retargeting**

**For EEA users**

Dianomi does not cookie EEA users (and other users from countries were GDPR applies) for the purpose of behavioural targeting. Dianomi will serve ads to EEA users contextually and therefore will not require users’ consent for targeting purposes.

Apart from as stated above, generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email and for behavioural targeting. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.  

**Purposes for which we will use your personal data**

**Marketing / Targeting**

We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:

**Promotional offers from us -**

For users outside the EEA, We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). In most cases we will show you recommendations based on the context of the page and not on your personal data profile.

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered your details in one of our form

In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach your local authority so please contact us in the first instance.

You have certain rights regarding your personal data, please [see here.](https://ico.org.uk/)

Where we rely on our legitimate interests to obtain and use your personal data then you have the right to object if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests.

Where processing is carried out based upon your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent.

Your ability to exercise these rights will depend on a number of factors and in some instances, we will not be able to comply with your request e.g. because we have legitimate grounds for not doing so or where the right does not apply to the particular data we hold on you.

You should note that if you exercise certain of these rights we may be unable to continue to provide some or all of our services to you (for example where the personal data is required by us to comply with a statutory requirement, or is necessary in order for us to perform our contract with you).

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What we may need from you**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity such as your driving licence or passport and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
