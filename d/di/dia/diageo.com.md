Information about many of Diageo’s brands can be found at [www.diageobrands.com](http://www.diageobrands.com/). 

We may occasionally send you communications about brands not featured on [www.diageobrands.com](http://www.diageobrands.com/) (e.g. new brands).

Providing general permission for us to communicate with you about our brands does not mean that you will receive communications about all Diageo’s brands. We will only communicate with you about those brands that we think may be of particular interest to you. Any such communications will provide you with an opportunity to unsubscribe from the brand in question and/or from all communications about Diageo brands.
