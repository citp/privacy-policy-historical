### Browser Data

This website uses cookies to improve your user experience. Cookies are elements of data sent to your browser which can then be stored on your computer. Although you may disable cookies in your browser and still access and use this website, disabling cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of certain features on the website. 

### Owner Profile

Owners can choose to provide Diamond Resorts International® with credit-card information. This information is primarily used to assist owners in making payments quickly without having to type in the same information repeatedly.

### Contests

Diamond Resorts International® frequently sponsors contests to give owners the opportunity to win great travel prizes. Information collected by Diamond Resorts International® for such contests can include contact information and survey questions. Contact information is used to notify contest winners, and survey information is used to develop promotions and product improvements to Diamond Resorts International®.

### Online Surveys

Diamond Resorts International® values opinions and comments from owners so we frequently conduct online surveys. These surveys are entirely optional for all owners. Typically, the information is aggregated and used to make improvements to Diamond Resorts International® products and services and to develop appealing content, features and promotions for owners. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.

### IP Addresses

Diamond Resorts International® collects IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers and for system administration.

### Who will the information be shared with, if anyone?

Our affiliates include companies that are subsidiaries and affiliates of Diamond Resorts Corporation and Diamond Resorts (Europe) Limited. Your information may be shared with any of our affiliates. Other than to Interval International Inc. and its subsidiaries, data will not be made available to companies outside our group for marketing purposes although it may be necessary, from time to time, to release information about you (including sensitive information such as a medical condition, disability or a dietary requirement) to external suppliers such as airlines/car hire companies to enable a comprehensive service to be provided to you and to process the transaction information. Please also be advised that all airlines are now required by laws introduced in the US and other countries to give cross border control agencies access to customer data. Accordingly any information held about you and your travel arrangements may be disclosed to the customs and immigration authorities of any country in your itinerary. The data of European Members of THE Club® may also be supplied to First National Trustee Company Limited, an Isle of Man based company (whose details are set out in the Deed of Trust) in order to enable it to perform its supervisory and regulatory functions. We do not sell individual customer names or other private profile information to third parties and have no intention of doing so in the future. Occasionally, Diamond Resorts International® will hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market-research surveys and contest-entry processing and will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects. The information we provide to such third parties is protected by a confidentiality agreement ensuring that it is used solely for completing the specific project. See "What other information should I know about my privacy?" below.

### How to access your information (including how to update or correct inaccuracies)

Please contact us at THEClub@diamondresorts.com or please notify us by writing to our Customer Service department at 10600 West Charleston Blvd, Las Vegas, Nevada 89135

### What safeguards are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?

The data provided by you will be treated as confidential and security measures have been implemented to prevent unauthorized processing. All information you provide to Diamond Resorts International® is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. While we endeavor to maintain the confidentiality of all material submitted that is marked as confidential by the submitter, we cannot accept, and hereby expressly disclaim any liability from losses relating to the unauthorized disclosure or interception via the Internet of any information that you submit.

### What other information should I know about my privacy?

Diamond Resorts International® may also disclose owner information, if, in good faith, we belief that disclosure is necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of Diamond Resorts International® or in order to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. Any material changes in the way Diamond Resorts International® uses personal information will be described in future versions of this Privacy Policy. Of course, you may always submit concerns regarding our Privacy Policy or our privacy practices to THEClub@diamondresorts.com. Please reference the Privacy Policy in your subject line.
