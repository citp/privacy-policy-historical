<p>Dizzler   understands that privacy is extremely important to you and is committed to   protecting the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy   explains how IDV8, Inc. ("Dizzler") collects and uses personally   identifiable information about visitors to the site and users of the service.   By visiting the Dizzler site or using its services, you are accepting the   practices outline in this Privacy Policy. This policy does not apply to the   practices of third parties that Dizzler does not own or control, or to   individuals that Dizzler does not employ or manage. </p>
<p><u>The information Dizzler collects</u> <br>
	Dizzler   collects non-personally identifiable information when you visit our website (<a href="http://www.dizzler.com">www.Dizzler.com</a>). This data includes your IP   address, the IP address and URL of the Website that sent you to the Dizzler   main page, browser cookie and browser type. This data is automatically   recorded in our server logs and is used to manage the website, track usage   and improve the Dizzler website and services. <br>
	When   you use Dizzler services and register for Dizzler, we collect additional   information such as your name, mobile phone number, mobile phone device   information and network carrier information. We also collect any optional   information you choose to enter like email address, location information   (such as address, zip code, and country), gender and age.<br>
	When   you connect to the Dizzler services on your mobile device, if your mobile   phone service provider uniquely identifies the device, Dizzler will receive   this information. Dizzler may use your unique mobile device identification   information to offer you extended services and/or functionality. Some mobile   phone service providers are required to operate a system that will record the   physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the mobile   phone service provider, Dizzler may automatically receive this information.<br>
	When   you visit the Dizzler site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer   that uniquely identifies your browser. Dizzler uses both session cookies -   cookies that expire after you close your browser - and persistent cookies -   cookies that can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.   Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example,   advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.   The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will   direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to   command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to   fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies   activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of   Dizzler's most attractive features.<br>
	Dizzler   members can invite friends to join the service and preview content by sending   invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Dizzler stores the   email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added as   Friends of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of   the invitations. </p>
<p><u>How Dizzler uses your personal information</u> <br>
	Dizzler   uses your personal information to operate, maintain and provide you with the   features and functionality of the Dizzler site and services. Dizzler uses   your mobile phone number to deliver the mobile content you create and other   content you request. <br>
	Additionally,   Dizzler may, from time to time, use your email address or other personally   identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages as part of   a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or   subsequently opt-out. We may also use your email address without further   consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you   of major Dizzler service changes or for customer service purposes). <br>
	Dizzler   uses personally identifiable and certain non-personally identifiable   information so that:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>You will not have to re-enter        information during your visit or the next time you visit the Dizzler        site </li>
	<li>We can improve the quality and        design of our website and services and to create new features and        functionality </li>
	<li>We can monitor the        effectiveness of our marketing campaigns </li>
	<li>We can monitor aggregate        metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>Any   personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on the   Dizzler site, in our discussion, rating and chat areas, within your public   profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used   by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other   users when you upload contents or send messages from the Dizzler site. Others   can contact you as a result of messages you send. Any text, audio, image or   other content posted at the direction of users onto the Dizzler site becomes   published content and is not considered personally identifiable information   for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. In addition, Dizzler may use   comments posted in public areas about the Dizzler site or services for   editorial purposes or in promotional, advertising or marketing materials.   Users who submit such comments in these public places on the site grant a   non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free license to   Dizzler to transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, reproduce, edit,   translate and reformat and otherwise use such public information. </p>
<p><u>Information Sharing and Disclosure</u> <br>
	Dizzler   may also share your information in cases where we believe that disclosure is   necessary to: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a   subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by Dizzler, whether   or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the Dizzler   Terms of Use or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of   members of the public and users of the service. Â&nbsp;Dizzler reserves the right to transfer   personal information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or   substantially all of Dizzler's stock or assets.</p>
<p>Â&nbsp;<u>Security of Your Personal Information</u><br>
	Your   Dizzler account information is protected by a password for your privacy and   security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your   password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a   shared computer. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software   to protect the security of your personal information during transmission,   which encrypts all of the information you input. Only Dizzler employees who   need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer   service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are   kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.<br>
	<u>Your ability to Edit your Account Information and   Preferences</u> <br>
	You   may edit or correct your personal profile information and email preferences   at any time by logging into your account and accessing your My Zoo page.   Users who visit this page can opt out of receiving future marketing   communications from Dizzler. Please note that content uploaded by Users to   Dizzler cannot be removed. For your privacy and security, we request a unique   password to verify your identity before granting you profile access in order   to make corrections or changes. </p>

If you are a user accessing the Dizzler site from the   European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing   personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States   laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Dizzler site,   which is governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Use, you   are transferring your personal information to the United States and you   expressly consent to that transfer.</p>

	As   part of the Dizzler service, we may provide links to other websites and   products. If you choose to visit a third party website or use its products or   services, please be aware that the third party's privacy policy, not this   Privacy Policy, will be in effect.
