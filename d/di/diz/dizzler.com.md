Dizzler understands that privacy is extremely important to you and is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how IDV8, Inc. ("Dizzler") collects and uses personally identifiable information about visitors to the site and users of the service. By visiting the Dizzler site or using its services, you are accepting the practices outline in this Privacy Policy. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Dizzler does not own or control, or to individuals that Dizzler does not employ or manage. 

_The information Dizzler collects_   
Dizzler collects non-personally identifiable information when you visit our website ([www.Dizzler.com](http://www.dizzler.com/)). This data includes your IP address, the IP address and URL of the Website that sent you to the Dizzler main page, browser cookie and browser type. This data is automatically recorded in our server logs and is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the Dizzler website and services.   
When you use Dizzler services and register for Dizzler, we collect additional information such as your name, mobile phone number, mobile phone device information and network carrier information. We also collect any optional information you choose to enter like email address, location information (such as address, zip code, and country), gender and age.  
When you connect to the Dizzler services on your mobile device, if your mobile phone service provider uniquely identifies the device, Dizzler will receive this information. Dizzler may use your unique mobile device identification information to offer you extended services and/or functionality. Some mobile phone service providers are required to operate a system that will record the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the mobile phone service provider, Dizzler may automatically receive this information.  
When you visit the Dizzler site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Dizzler uses both session cookies - cookies that expire after you close your browser - and persistent cookies - cookies that can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Dizzler's most attractive features.  
Dizzler members can invite friends to join the service and preview content by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Dizzler stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added as Friends of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations.
