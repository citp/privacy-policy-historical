# Spreadsheet Software for Budgeting, Forecasting and Management Reporting: A3 Solutions

Your privacy is important to A3 Solutions. This statement describes and explains our policies and procedures. This privacy statement covers the www.a3si.com site, not third party sites that are linked off of www.a3si.com. If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should send an email, with the subject heading "Privacy Question" to [webmaster@a3si.com ](mailto:webmaster@a3si.com)

On the www.a3si.com website we collect the following information: personal information (when volunteered by you) and log files, and cookies if you accept them. All is described below. 

## Personal Information

You can access a3si.com without providing us with any personal information. However, A3 Solutions does collect information from our users at different points on our web site, in which you volunteer your personal information in response to registrations. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name, email, address, etc.). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he/she has expressed interest. 

## Cookies 

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. A cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. By setting a cookie on our site, users will not have to register more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will have to complete a registration page more than once. 

## Log Files

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

## Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

We DO NOT Share Personal Information with third parties.

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

## Security

This Web site takes precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to help us keep your information secure. 

## Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, or email), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done by returning the original message to the sender with details of the correction requested or by emailing us at [webmaster@a3si.com ](mailto:webmaster@a3si.com) and requesting a correction/update or deletion of your personal information. Please be sure to include a message communicating the change you would like made in the subject line and body of the email. 

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, on our website and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
