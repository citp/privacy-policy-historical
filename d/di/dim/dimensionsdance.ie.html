<h2>7. How we protect Personal Information</h2>
Dimensions Dance employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of Personal Information.

If you choose to contact Dimensions Dance through the Website, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. Dimensions Dance assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, should you choose to pay by credit card when making a booking, reservation or purchase on the Website, your card details are encrypted for the transaction.<br><br>
In communicating with you, we may send email as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members, Guests, or Subscribers cannot readily process encrypted email. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted email.<br><br>

<h2>8. Privacy</h2>
<strong>Cookies and pixel tags</strong><br>
A Cookie is a small text file that our computer sends to your computer, and that your computer sends back to us each time you make a request from our Website. A cookie contains a unique identification number that identifies the visitor's browser, but not necessarily the visitor. A pixel tag is a small graphic image similar to a cookie.<br><br>
When you access our Website, our computer may seek to place "cookies" or "pixel tags" on your personal computer to collect Session Data. Cookies and pixel tags help us recognize you when you visit our Website again. Unless a visitor specifically informs us of his/her identity (e.g. by registering with us), we will not know who the individual visitor is.<br><br>
Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit. You can learn more about the use of cookies by visiting <a href="http://networkadvertising.org">http://networkadvertising.org</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie.</a><br><br>
If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will be able to access those parts of our Website that are available to the general public, but you will not be able to access many of the Products and Services offered at our Website.<br><br>
In addition, in our emails and other communications, we will include instructions on how to unsubscribe and inform us of preferences if you decide you do not want to receive any future marketing or promotional emails from us.<br><br>
<strong>Monitoring</strong><br>
Dimensions Dance may from time to time monitor and review any information transmitted or received through the Website for quality assurance and other purposes. We reserve the right to censor, edit, remove, or prohibit the transmission or receipt of any information that Dimensions Dance deems inappropriate, or in violation of these Terms and Conditions. During monitoring, the information may be examined, recorded, or copied.<br><br>

<h2>9. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
We may change or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time. We may also undergo a change of ownership. We will post an appropriate notice of changes to the Privacy Policy and changes or ownership on our Website. Privacy Policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised Privacy Policy to the Website, as well as to existing information held by us.<br><br>
