            <p><b>Our Online Data Collection and Use Practices</b><br>
This statement explains the online data collection and use practices of DivorceNet.com; 
the statement and its description of our online data practices does not apply 
to other online sites or to other services provided by Lawtek Media Group, LLC. 
This statement does not apply to the offline data collection and use practices 
of Lawtek Media Group, LLC. Please be aware that this privacy statement and the 
choices you make on this site will not necessarily apply to personal information 
you may have provided or will provide to Lawtek in other settings.</p> 
<p>Since Internet technologies continue to evolve and Internet business models 
  are not fully established, this statement is subject to change. Any changes 
  to the privacy statement will be posted on this page and we will notify you 
  of any material changes by placing a prominent notice on the home page of DivorceNet.com. 
  We encourage you to periodically visit this page to stay informed about the 
  data practices of DivorceNet.com. By using this site, you consent to the data 
  practices described on this page and any updates. </p>
<p><b>The Information We Collect On This Site</b><br>
  DivorceNet.com maintains and uses the anonymous, non-personal information collected 
  in our server log files. This information includes such anonymous data as number 
  of visitors to the site, most popular pages, the user's operating system (for 
  example, Macintosh or Windows), and user's browser type (for example, Netscape 
  Navigator or Internet Explorer). We use this information to help us improve 
  our website and enhance your viewing experience. The server log files do not 
  collect email addresses or other personally identifying information. We do not 
  tie this information to personal data and therefore it remains anonymous. </p>
<p><b>Surveys</b><br>
  The information we gather from online surveys on the DivorceNet.com site is for 
  DivorceNet.com use only. We generally do not request personally identifiable information 
  such as name or email address in connection with our surveys. If we publish 
  the results of a survey online, the information is in a collective, non-personally 
  identifiable form. </p>
<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
  Occasionally our website may use temporary Cookie information to personalize 
  your viewing experience. For example, we may store your zip code so we can display 
  the stores closest to you. We do not correlate Cookie information with any personally 
  identifying information such as name, address or email address. </p>
<p><b>The Information You Provide</b><br>
  There are a number of places on this website where you can sign up for a promotion, 
  register for an MVP Card, request information, apply for a job, or otherwise 
  participate in a program offered by DivorceNet.com or by other companies on the 
  DivorceNet.com site. You may be asked to provide personal information in connection 
  with these activities. Personal information may include your name, address, 
  e-mail, credit card information, MVP Card number, etc. This section will describe 
  how DivorceNet.com collects and uses the personal information you provide to DivorceNet.com 
  on the DivorceNet.com site. This section does not apply to the data collection 
  practices of other companies that may offer a program or activity jointly with 
  DivorceNet.com. </p>
<p>When you change your MVP Card information, get additional or replacement MVP 
  Cards, or participate in the Lion Shop &amp; Share program, we require personal 
  information such as your name, mailing address, and phone number to administer 
  the MVP Card program, to provide you with the information or service you requested, 
  and to perform analyses of our services. We do not share this information with 
  outside parties, however, we have hired outside companies to assist us in administering 
  the program, and to complete your request, deliver customized promotional offers 
  to you, such as additional savings and to perform statistical analyses of our 
  services. DivorceNet.com will provide those other companies with the information 
  they need to perform the services and we prohibit them from using the information 
  for other purposes. Please be aware that we do not view subsidiaries and affiliates 
  of Lawtek as outside parties or outside companies and that we may periodically 
  share personal information or aggregated information with Lawtek subsidiaries 
  and affiliates. </p>
<p>You may also be asked to provide personal information such as your name, address, 
  email address and phone number when you participate in contests or promotional 
  offers from DivorceNet.com or from other companies on the DivorceNet.com site. When 
  this information is submitted to DivorceNet.com, it is used to administer the 
  contest or promotional offer, and also to provide you with the information or 
  service you requested. We do not control how other companies use the information 
  you may provide to them and recommend that you check the Privacy Statement of 
  the company requesting information for a description of their data collection 
  practices. We do not share this information except where we have hired an outside 
  company to administer the service, program or contest or perform statistical 
  analyses of our services, or where the activity is sponsored by another company. 
  As we noted above, DivorceNet.com does not view subsidiaries and affiliates of 
  Lawtek as outside companies and we may periodically share personal information 
  or aggregated information with Lawtek subsidiaries and affiliates. </p>
<p>In addition, DivorceNet.com collects personal information when you voluntarily 
  submit it to us, for example, when you apply for a job or email consumer relations. 
  We have no obligation of any kind with respect to such information except as 
  provided in this privacy statement. We use such information internally for the 
  purposes collected and we treat any comments, suggestions and the like as public 
  information. </p>
<p>The DivorceNet.com site provides links to third party sites such as usleagalforms.com, 
  completecase.com and lawyers.com as a service to our viewers and associates. 
  You may be asked to provide personal information in connection with activities 
  on such third party sites. Please be aware that DivorceNet.com does not control 
  such third party sites, does not endorse their content and is not responsible
