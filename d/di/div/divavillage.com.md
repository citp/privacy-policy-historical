Thank you for using DreamItAlive!   
Our mission is to help you discover and achieve your dreams. To do that, we help you create your own virtual Dreamboard and other content and we also show you personalized content and ads we think you’ll be interested in based on information we collect from you and third parties. We only use that information where we have a proper legal basis for doing so. We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it. Because we’re an internet company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. We welcome your questions and comments on this policy.   
We collect information in a few different ways:   
1\. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it   
When you sign up for or use DreamItAlive, you give us certain information voluntarily. This includes your name, email address, phone number, profile photo, dream information such as images, intentions, emotions and tags, comments, and any other information you give us. You can also choose to share with us location data or additional photos. If you buy something on DreamItAlive, we collect payment information, contact information (address and phone number) and details of what you bought. If you buy something for someone else on DreamItAlive, we collect their delivery details and contact information. If you link your Facebook or Google account or accounts from other third party services to DreamItAlive, we also get information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts). The information we get from those services depends on your settings and their privacy policies, so please check what those are.   
2\. We also get technical information when you use DreamItAlive   
Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, certain information gets created and logged automatically. The same is true when you use DreamItAlive. Here are some of the types of information we collect: 

  * **Log data.** When you use DreamItAlive, our servers record information (“log data”), including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when you’re using it. This log data includes your Internet Protocol address, the address of and activity on websites you visit that incorporate DreamItAlive features (like the “Save” button—more details below), searches, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used DreamItAlive, cookie data and device data. 
  * **Cookie data.** We also use “cookies” (small text files sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your DreamItAlive account or your browser) or similar technologies to capture log data. When we use cookies or other similar technologies, we use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit DreamItAlive. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your DreamItAlive account (including information about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not. 
  * **Device information.** In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you’re using DreamItAlive on, including type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider. 

  
3\. Our partners and advertisers share information with us   
Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, certain information gets created and logged automatically. The same is true when you use DreamItAlive. Here are some of the types of information we collect: 

  * Some websites or apps use DreamItAlive features such as our “Save” button, or you may install our “Save” button for your browser. If so, we collect log data from those sites or apps. 
  * Online advertisers or third parties share information with us to measure or improve the performance of ads on DreamItAlive, or to figure out what kinds of ads to show you. This includes information about your visits to an advertiser's site or purchases you made from them, or information about your interests from a third party service, which we might use to help show you ads. 

  
What we do with the info we collect:   
We use the information we collect to provide the Service to you. We commit to showing you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you. In order to do that, it’s necessary for us to use your information to: 

  * Identify you when you use DreamItAlive, and process your transactions. 
  * Recommend Dreams, Dreamboards, topics or categories you might like based on your activity on DreamItAlive. For example, if we see you’re into cooking, we may suggest food-related Dreams, Dreamboards or people that we think you might like or show you food-related ads. 
  * Respond to your questions or comments. 

  
In addition and for similar reasons, we have a legitimate interest in using your information in these ways. It is also fundamental to the nature of the Service we provide. In short, it’s necessary for us to do these things in order to make the Service relevant, interesting and personal to you like we promised, and it’s in both of our interests for us to do that.   
We also have a legitimate interest to improve DreamItAlive, maintain our relationship with you, and protect users. We both benefit when we use your information to: 

  * Suggest other people who have similar interests and dreams. For example, if you follow travel, we may suggest dreams related to travel, other members with travel dreams, or products and services related to travel that you might like. 
  * Help your friends and contacts find you on DreamItAlive, if you agree to this in your settings. For example, if you sign up using a Facebook account, we can help your Facebook friends find you on DreamItAlive when they first sign up for DreamItAlive. Or, people can search for your account on DreamItAlive using your email. 
  * Conduct analytics on who is using DreamItAlive and what they are doing. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature on DreamItAlive, we can understand which version is better. 
  * Improve DreamItAlive and offer new features. 
  * Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like saves or comments, happens on DreamItAlive) and news by email or push notification, depending on your settings. For example, we send weekly updates that include Dreams you may like. You can decide to stop getting these notifications by updating your settings. 
  * Work with law enforcement and keep DreamItAlive safe. We may get requests for account information from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts. 

  
We have a legitimate interest in delivering ads that are relevant and interesting to you in order to generate revenue (providing this Service is expensive!) To further these interests we use the information we collect to: 

  * Tell our ad partners how their DreamItAlive ads are doing, and how to make them better. Some of this information is aggregated. For example, we would report to an advertiser that a certain percentage of people who viewed a Promoted Dream went on to visit that advertiser's site. In other instances, this information isn’t aggregated. For example, we would let an advertiser know that a particular Promoted Dream has been saved by certain people. 
  * Tell our ad partners the types of products you might be interested in. For example, if you create a Dreamboard dedicated to sports, we can tell a retailer that you’re more interested in sneakers than, say, ballet shoes. This helps us and our ad partners to make sure that the content and ads you see are relevant to you. 

  
We have a legitimate interest in using information we collect to customize your DreamItAlive experience based on your offsite behavior. For example, if you visit websites that sell electric guitars, we may suggest guitar or music related dreams to you. When we identify your interests based on your offsite behavior with cookies, we will obtain any consent we may need.   
In addition to the specific circumstances above, we’ll only use your information with your consent in order to: 

  * Send you marketing materials by email, text or push notification, depending on your account or operating system settings. Each time we send you marketing materials, we give you the option to unsubscribe. 
  * Identify your location and customize the content we show you. For example, if we know that you are based in San Francisco, we could show local products that might help you fulfill your Dreams. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings. 
  * Allow searching with photos. For example, if you take a photo of a pair of shoes or a piece of furniture you like, you can ask us to show you similar items. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings. 
  * Tell our ad partners how their ads are doing using the DreamItAlive tag. The DreamItAlive tag (a piece of code) delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on DreamItAlive. 

  
We’ll also rely on your consent where we use cookies to: 

  * Identify you across different browser sessions. This means if you log into DreamItAlive from your phone (or any device), we'll remember that you're you and you won't need to enter your login details each time you visit DreamItAlive. 
  * Show you ads you might be interested in. We use cookies to identify your interests based on your offsite behavior. We do this for existing users and for new users, and it helps us customize the new user experience. 

  
Transferring your information:   
DreamItAlive is a worldwide service. By using DreamItAlive, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country. We take additional measures when information is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA). This includes having standard clauses approved by the European Commission in our contracts with parties that receive information outside the EEA. We also rely on European Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers to countries outside the EEA.   
Choices you have about your info:   
Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices regarding your information. If you have a DreamItAlive account, many of the choices you have on DreamItAlive are built directly into DreamItAlive or your settings. For example, you can: 

  * Edit information in your Dreamboard at any time, decide whether your profile is public, private, or viewable by the DreamItAlive community. 
  * Edit information in your profile at any time, decide whether your profile is public, private, or viewable by the DreamItAlive community 
  * Link or unlink your DreamItAlive account from other services (like Facebook, Google or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also decide whether or not to publish your DreamItAlive activity to that service. 
  * Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we’ll deactivate it and remove your Dreamboard and Dreams from DreamItAlive. 

  
You also have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access DreamItAlive. For example: 

  * The browser you use lets you control cookies or other types of local data storage. 
  * Your mobile device lets you choose how and whether your location, photos, advertising identifiers and other data is shared with us. 

  
To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by your device or software provider.   
How and when we share information:   
Anyone can see the public Dreamboards and Dreams you create and the profile information you give us. We also make this public information available through what are called APIs (basically a technical way to share information quickly). For example, a partner can study what their most popular Dreams are or how their images are being shared on DreamItAlive by using a DreamItAlive API. Some of the ways we use your information require us to share information with third parties, so we can provide your DreamItAlive experience, make sure our customization is effective and comply with laws that apply to us. We share your information with: 

  * Other services (like Facebook or Google) when you decide to link your DreamItAlive account to those services or publish your activity on DreamItAlive to them. For example, you can choose to publish your dreams to Facebook or Twitter. 
  * Merchants you purchase from on DreamItAlive. When you buy something on DreamItAlive using your payment card, we share information necessary for you to make your purchase, such as your payment card information, contact information, and other information about the transaction with the merchant you’re buying from. For example, if you buy something on DreamItAlive using Apple Pay, your card number isn’t shared with the merchant, but we still share contact and transaction information. We share this information because it’s necessary to make the purchase. The merchants treat this information in the same way as if you had made a purchase from their website directly, which means that their privacy policies and marketing policies apply to the information we share with them. 
  * Online advertisers and third party companies that we or they use to audit or improve the delivery and performance of ads or content on websites and apps (for example, through Google Analytics). This includes what Dreams or ads you were shown on DreamItAlive and whether or how you engaged with those Dreams or ads, or other information about your activity on DreamItAlive. 
  * Third party companies or individuals that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we share payment card information with the payment companies we use to store your payment information. We also share data with security consultants to help us get better at identifying spam. Some information we acquire may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. 
  * Law enforcement agencies or government agencies. We only share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or DreamItAlive; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. 
  * Our wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganisation, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser). 

  
How long we keep your information:   
We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide DreamItAlive to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.   
Our policy on children’s information:   
Children under 13 are not allowed to use DreamItAlive. If you are based in the EEA you may only use DreamItAlive if you are over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your country or if verifiable parental consent for your use of DreamItAlive has been provided to us. If you are a parent and you learn that your child is using DreamItAlive and you don't want them to, please contact us.   
Your options:   
You have options in relation to the information that we have about you described below. To exercise these options, please contact us. If you're an EEA user, you can: 

  * Access the information we hold about you. We'll usually share this with you within 30 days of you asking us for it. 
  * Have your information corrected or deleted. You can update your information in your settings. If you have problems updating the information or if you would like us to delete it, contact us. 
  * Object to us processing your information. You can ask us to stop using your information, including when we use your information to send you marketing emails or push notifications. If you opt out of receiving marketing messages from us, we may still send you newsletters and updates about your account, such as when another user comments on one of your Dreams. We only send you marketing material if you've agreed to it, but if you'd rather we don't, you can easily unsubscribe at any time. 
  * Have the information you provided to us sent to another organization, where we hold this information with your consent or for the performance of a contract with you, where it's technically feasible. 
  * Complain to a regulator. If you're based in the EEA and think that we haven't complied with data protection laws, you have a right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. 

  
How we make changes to this policy:   
We may change this policy from time to time and if we do, we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use DreamItAlive after those changes are in effect, you agree to the new policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice or get your consent, as required by law.
