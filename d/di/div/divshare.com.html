<p>This  document was last updated on December 8, 2006.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Terms</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Diversion Web Publishing, LLC</strong> ("Diversion Web  Publishing" or "DivShare") is committed to protecting your  privacy. This Privacy Statement sets forth our current privacy practices with  regard to the information we collect when you or your computer interact with  our web site.&nbsp; By accessing www.divshare.com,  you acknowledge and fully understand Diversion Web Publishing's Privacy  Statement and freely consent to the information collection and use practices  described in this Web site Privacy Statement.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party Advertisers and External Links</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Related  services and offerings with links from this web site, including vendor sites,  have their own privacy statements that can be viewed by clicking on the  corresponding links within each respective web site. Online merchants and  others who participate in DivShare services are encouraged to participate in  industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards  consumer privacy.&nbsp; However, since we do  not have direct control over the policies or practices of participating  merchants and other third parties, we are not responsible for the privacy  practices or contents of those sites.&nbsp; We  recommend and encourage that you always review the privacy policies of  merchants and other third parties before you provide any personal information  or complete any transaction with such parties.</p>
<p>  <strong>Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>DivShare collects certain  information from and about its users three ways: directly from our web server  logs, the user, and with cookies.</p>
<p><strong>a. Web Server Logs</strong></p>
<p>When  you visit our web site, we may track information to administer the site and  analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Your Internet protocol address. </li>
  <li>The kind of browser or computer you use. </li>
  <li>Number of links you click within the site. </li>
  <li>State or country from which you accessed the site. </li>
  <li>Date and time of your visit. </li>
  <li>Name of your Internet service provider. </li>
  <li>Web page you linked to our site from. </li>
  <li>Pages you viewed on the site.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b. Use of Cookies</strong></p>
<p>DivShare  may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience.&nbsp; A cookie is a small text file that is placed  on your hard disk by a web server.&nbsp;  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your  computer.&nbsp; Cookies are uniquely assigned  to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the  cookie to you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>One of  the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you  time.&nbsp; For example, if you personalize a  web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your  specific information on subsequent visits.&nbsp;  Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases  site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information  as well as providing personalized functionality.</p>
<p>DivShare  reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies,  but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our web site unless  there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into DivShare.com  a site that relies on third-party cookies).</p>
<p>You have  the ability to accept or decline cookies.&nbsp;  Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually  modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by  changing your browser settings, please be aware that this may disable some of  the functionality on our web site.</p>
<p><strong>c. Personal Information Users</strong></p>
<p>Visitors  to our web site can register to personalize our service.&nbsp; When you register, we will request some  personal information such as name, e-mail address, and other relevant  information. You may also be asked to disclose personal information to us so  that we can provide assistance and information to you. For example, such data  may be warranted in order to provide online technical support and  troubleshooting.</p>
<p>We will  not disclose personally identifiable information we collect from you to third  parties without your permission except to the extent necessary including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To  fulfill your service requests for services.</li>
  <li>To  protect ourselves from liability,</li>
  <li>To  respond to legal process or comply with law, or</li>
  <li>In  connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of the company.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use of Web Beacons or GIF files</strong> </p>
<p>  Web pages  on DivShare.com may contain electronic images known as web beacons – sometimes  also called single-pixel GIFs – that allow DivShare to count users who have  visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. DivShare prohibits Web  beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Data and File Security</strong></p>
<p>DivShare takes  all reasonable physical, technical, and managerial steps to safeguard the files  and personal information on DivShare.com.&nbsp;  All files are hosted on closely monitored servers in the United States.&nbsp; However, please note that this is not  a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or  destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial  safeguards.</p>
<p> If DivShare learns of a  security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so  that you can take appropriate protective steps. DivShare may post a notice on  DivShare.com if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may  have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. </p>
<p><strong>Accessing Web Account Information</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>We will  provide you with the means to ensure that personally identifiable information  in your web account file is correct and current.&nbsp; You may review this information by contacting  us by sending an email to our support attendant – <a href="mailto:support@divshare.com">support@divshare.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to this Statement</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>DivShare has  the discretion to occasionally update this privacy statement.&nbsp; When we do, we will also revise the “updated”  date at the top of this Privacy page.&nbsp; We  encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed  about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.&nbsp; Your continued use of the service constitutes  your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates.</p>
