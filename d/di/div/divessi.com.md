**2.2. Google Analytics and Universal Analytics**

Use of Google Analytics

(1) This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. We have activated IP anonymization on this website, so your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website usage and internet usage to the website operator.

The IP address provided by Google Analytics as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google information.

You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we point out that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this website in full. You may also prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading the browser plug-in available at the following link and installing it: [HTTP://TOOLS.GOOGLE.COM/DLPAGE/GAOPTOUT?HL=DE](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de). This website uses Google Analytics with the extension “_anonymizeIp ()”. As a result, IP addresses are processed in shortened form; reference to particular individuals can thus be excluded. Therefore, as far as the data collected about you contains a personal reference, it is immediately excluded and the personal data deleted immediately.

We use Google Analytics to analyze and regularly improve the use of our website. With the statistics we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. For the exceptional cases in which personal data is transferred to the US, Google has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, [HTTPS://WWW.PRIVACYSHIELD.GOV/EU-US-FRAMEWORK](https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework). The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 (f) GDPR.2

Information of the third party provider: Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, Fax: +353 (1) 436 1001.   
Terms of use:   
[HTTP://WWW.GOOGLE.COM/ANALYTICS/TERMS/DE.HTML](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html), data protection overview:   
[HTTP://WWW.GOOGLE.COM/INTL/DE/ANALYTICS/LEARN/PRIVACY.HTML](http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/learn/privacy.html), as well as the data protection statement:   
[HTTP://WWW.GOOGLE.DE/INTL/DE/POLICIES/PRIVACY](http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy).

This website also uses Google Analytics for a cross-device analysis of visitor traffic conducted via a user ID. You can disable the cross-device analysis of your use in your customer account under “My Data”, “Personal Information”.

\--> Universal Analytics enables cross-device tracking of users and leads to more refined information for those responsible (generally [HTTPS://SUPPORT.GOOGLE.COM/ANALYTICS/ANSWER/2790010](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2790010)). The opinion of the supervisory authorities is not yet available. In any case, the data subject must be informed about the extended use and be shown the possibility to opt-out.

The legal basis for this processing is art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 (a) or (f) GDPR.

**2.3. Google Advertising Network, Remarketing and DoubleClick**

**2.3.1. Use of Google AdWords Conversion**

We use the offer of Google Adwords, in order to draw attention to our attractive offers with the help of advertising (so-called Google Adwords) on external web pages. In relation to the data of the advertising campaigns, we can determine how successful the individual advertising measures are. We are interested in showing you advertisements that are of interest to you, to make our website more interesting to you and to achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs.

These advertising materials are supplied by Google via so-called “ad servers”. To do this, we use ad server cookies, from which certain performance metrics such as ads or user clicks can be measured. If you access our website through a Google ad, Google Adwords will store a cookie on your PC. These cookies usually lose their validity after 30 days and should not serve to personally identify you. As a rule, the unique cookie ID, number of ad impressions per placement (frequency), last impression (relevant for post-view conversions) and opt-out information (marking that the user no longer wants to be addressed) are usually stored as analysis values for this cookie.

These cookies allow Google to recognize your internet browser. If a user visits certain pages of an Adwords customer’s website and the cookie stored on their computer has not yet expired, Google and the customer may discover that the user clicked on the advertisement and was redirected to that page. Each Adwords customer is assigned a different cookie. Thus cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of Adwords customers. We ourselves do not collect and process any personal data in the aforementioned advertising measures. We receive only statistical evaluations provided by Google. On the basis of these evaluations, we can identify which of the advertising measures used are particularly effective. We do not receive any further data from the use of the advertising material; in particular, we cannot identify the users on the basis of this information.

Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server. We have no influence over the scope of the data collected by the employment of this tool by Google and the further use of such data, and inform you therefore according to our level of knowledge: By including AdWords Conversion, Google receives the information that you have accessed the relevant part of our website or have clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a service provided by Google, Google may associate the visit with your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a chance that the provider will find out your IP address and store it.

You can prevent participation in this tracking process in several ways:   
a) by adjusting your browser software accordingly, in particular, the suppression of third-party cookies results in you not receiving any third-party ads;   
b) by disabling the cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain “www.googleadservices.com”, [HTTPS://WWW.GOOGLE.DE/SETTINGS/ADS](https://www.google.de/settings/ads), although this setting will be deleted if you delete your cookies;   
c) by deactivating the interest-based advertisements of the providers that are part of the “About Ads” self-regulation campaign via the link [HTTP://WWW.ABOUTADS.INFO/CHOICES](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), although this setting will be deleted if you delete your cookies;   
d) by permanent deactivation in your Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome browsers under the link [HTTP://WWW.GOOGLE.COM/SETTINGS/ADS/PLUGIN](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin). We point out that, in this case, you may not be able to use all features of this offer in full.

The legal basis for the processing of your data is art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 (a) GDPR.

For more information about privacy at Google, see: [HTTP://WWW.GOOGLE.COM/INTL/DE/POLICIES/PRIVACY](http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy) and [HTTPS://SERVICES.GOOGLE.COM/SITESTATS/DE.HTML](https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html). Alternatively, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website at [HTTP://WWW.NETWORKADVERTISING.ORG](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Google has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, [HTTPS://WWW.PRIVACYSHIELD.GOV/EU-US-FRAMEWORK](https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework).

  
**2.3.2. Remarketing**

In addition to Adwords Conversion, we use the Google remarketing application. This is a process that we would like to raise with you again. Through this application, you can see our ads after visiting our website as you continue to use the internet. This is done by means of cookies stored in your browser, through which your usage behavior when visiting various websites is recorded and evaluated by Google. This is how Google determines your previous visit to our website. Consolidation of the data collected during the remarketing with your personal data, which may be stored by Google, does not occur by Google according to its own statements. In particular, according to Google, pseudonymization is used in remarketing.

With the use of remarketing, information about your browsing behavior is collected for marketing purposes in anonymous form and stored on your computer using cookies (targeting / retargeting). Based on an algorithm, we can then show you targeted product recommendations as personalized banner ads on other websites (so-called publishers). If you do not want this to occur, you can disable it via the Ads Preferences Manager ([HTTPS://SUPPORT.GOOGLE.COM/ADS/ANSWER/2662922?HL=DE](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=de)).

The legal basis for the processing of your data is art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1(a) GDPR.

****2.3.3. DoubleClick by Google****

This website continues to use the online marketing tool, DoubleClick, by Google. DoubleClick uses cookies to place ads that are relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reports, or to prevent a user from seeing the same ads multiple times. Google uses a cookie ID to determine which ads are shown in which browser and can prevent them from being displayed multiple times. In addition, DoubleClick uses cookie IDs to track so-called conversions related to advertising requests. This is the case if, for example, a user sees a DoubleClick advertisement and later goes to the advertiser’s website with the same browser and buys something there. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies do not contain personal information.

Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server. We have no influence over the scope of the data collected by the employment of this tool by Google and the further use of such data, and inform you therefore according to our level of knowledge: By including DoubleClick, Google receives the information that you have accessed the relevant part of our website or have clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a service provided by Google, Google may associate the visit with your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a chance that the provider will find out your IP address and store it.

You can prevent participation in this tracking process in several ways: a) by adjusting your browser software accordingly, in particular, the suppression of third-party cookies results in you not receiving any third-party ads; b) by disabling the cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain “www.googleadservices.com”, [HTTPS://WWW.GOOGLE.DE/SETTINGS/ADS](https://www.google.de/settings/ads), although this setting will be deleted if you delete your cookies; c) by deactivating the interest-based advertisements of the providers that are part of the “About Ads” self-regulation campaign via the link [HTTP://WWW.ABOUTADS.INFO/CHOICES](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), although this setting will be deleted if you delete your cookies; d) by permanent deactivation in your Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome browsers under the link [HTTP://WWW.GOOGLE.COM/SETTINGS/ADS/PLUGIN](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin). We point out that, in this case, you may not be able to use all features of this offer in full.

The legal basis for the processing of your data is art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1(a) GDPR.

Further information on DoubleClick by Google is available at [HTTPS://WWW.GOOGLE.DE/DOUBLECLICK](https://www.google.de/doubleclick) and [HTTP://SUPPORT.GOOGLE.COM/ADSENSE/ANSWER/2839090](http://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2839090), as well as on data protection generally at Google: [HTTPS://WWW.GOOGLE.DE/INTL/DE/POLICIES/PRIVACY](https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy). Alternatively, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website at [HTTP://WWW.NETWORKADVERTISING.ORG](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Google has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, [HTTPS://WWW.PRIVACYSHIELD.GOV/EU-US-FRAMEWORK](https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework).

**2.4. Facebook Pixel**

For conversion measurement, our website uses the pixel visitor promotion of Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook“).

In this way, the behaviour of the site visitors can be tracked after they have been redirected by clicking on a Facebook ad on the website of the provider. As a result, the effectiveness of Facebook ads can be evaluated for statistical and market research purposes and future advertising measures optimized.

The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website; we cannot draw any conclusions about the identity of users. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and Facebook can use the data for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with the Facebook data usage directive. As a result, Facebook can enable advertising to be displayed on Facebook sites and outside of Facebook. This use of the data cannot be influenced by us as a site operator.

See the data protection notice of Facebook for more information on how to protect your privacy: [HTTPS://WWW.FACEBOOK.COM/ABOUT/PRIVACY/](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/).

You can also disable the “Custom Audiences” remarketing feature in advertisement settings at[HTTPS://WWW.FACEBOOK.COM/ADS/PREFERENCES/?ENTRY_PRODUCT=AD_SETTINGS_SCREEN](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen). For this you have to be logged in to Facebook.

If you do not have a Facebook account, you can opt out of Facebook Commercial Advertising on the website of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance: [HTTP://WWW.YOURONLINECHOICES.COM/DE/PRAFERENZMANAGEMENT/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/).

**3.  HANDLING OF PERSONAL DATA IN CASE OF USE BY SOCIAL MEDIA PLUG-INS**

We currently use social media plug-ins from the following providers: Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest.

We use the so-called two-click solution. In other words, when you visit our site, initially no personal data is passed on to the providers of the plug-ins. The provider of the plug-in can be recognized by the marking on the box above the first letter or the logo. We give you the opportunity to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in via the button. Only if you click on the highlighted field and activate it does the plug-in provider receive the information that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online service. In addition, the data specified in this declaration will be transmitted. In the case of Facebook, according to the respective provider in Germany, the IP address is anonymized immediately after collection. By activating the plug-in, personal data will be transmitted by you to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (in the case of US providers, in the USA). Since the plug-in provider carries out the data collection, in particular via cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies before clicking on the greyed box via the security settings of your browser.

We have no control over the collected data and data processing operations, nor are we aware of the full extent of the data collection, the purpose of the processing and the retention periods. We also have no information on the deletion of data collected by the plug-in provider. The plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as user profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or tailor-made website design. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (also for non-logged-in users) for the presentation of needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the formation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this right. Through the plug-ins, we offer you the opportunity to interact with social networks and other users so that we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 (f) GDPR.

The data transfer takes place regardless of whether you own an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in there. If you are logged in to the plug-in provider, the data we collect about you will be allocated directly to your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you press the activate button and, for example, link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it with your contacts publicly. We recommend that you log out regularly after using a social network, but especially before activating the button, as this will prevent you from being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider.

For more information on the purpose and scope of the data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider, refer to the following data protection statements of these providers. There you will also find further information about your rights regarding this and settings options for the protection of your privacy.
