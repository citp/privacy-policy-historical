# Privacy - Interactive One

**_Last revised April 20, 2015_**  
Interactive One, LLC (“IONE,” also referred to as “we,” “our,” or “us”), offers access to its services (“Services”) through a network of related digital content and social networking websites and platforms (accessed, and/or used, via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise), that are owned and operated by IONE (each, a “Site” and collectively, the “Sites”). This Privacy Policy describes the type of information we or third parties may collect from you while you visit or otherwise interact with the Sites and how we may use and share that information. This Privacy Policy also explains the choices you can make about the ways this information is used by us. The term Sites when used herein refers to those IONE sites, Services, interactive features, and applications that post or link to this Privacy Policy.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the Terms of Service provided at each Site, which governs your use of the Sites. Since IONE offers many different Services, additional terms or requirements may apply to certain service offerings and these additional terms will accompany such offering. By accessing and using any of the Sites (including, without limitation, any social networking features, applications, communities or other interactive content offered on the Sites) and Services, you agree to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service provided on the Site. Some Services are provided on mobile and wireless devices and this Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply, unless otherwise indicated. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, please do not use the Site or the Services. Please note that certain features or Services discussed in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on the Sites at any particular time.

## APPLICABILITY AND USER RESTRICTIONS

Unless specifically stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies to information collected on the Sites and Services, which also may be governed by separate or additional policies and may not apply to information about you collected by our affiliated providers, third party web sites (e.g., ad serving and tracking services), third party owned applications or offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from the Sites. The information collected or received by such affiliated providers, third parties and third party owned applications are subject to their own respective privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We are not responsible for compliance with other websites’ privacy policies or practices.

The Sites are not directed to children under the age of thirteen (13). In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we use reasonable commercial efforts to adhere to the prohibition on the collection of personal information online from children under the age of thirteen (13) without first obtaining verifiable parental consent. At a minimum, the Sites prohibit registration by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under the age of thirteen (13). Site use and membership is void where prohibited by law.

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

Whether you are a Site visitor, user of a particular Service, or a registered member, we take certain steps to protect your information. Collection of information is usually grouped into three categories: Personal Information, which is information that is personally identifiable to a specific visitor (further defined below), non personally identifiable information, which is information that is passively collected and information you may providethat is traceable to a computer or device but does not include Personal Information and is therefore not traceable back to you and cannot be used to identify a specific individual (further defined below) and aggregate information, which is general demographic information collected from large numbers of Site visitors that does not identify any individual member and is aggregated into statistical data and information. We may use or disclose non personal and aggregate information about you with third parties for any purpose. Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this information, or limit the third parties’ use of such information.

Some of the ads you receive on Site pages are customized based on predictions about your interests generated from your visits to the Sites (“Behavioral Advertising”). IONE adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (the “Principles”), developed by leading industry associations to apply consumer-friendly standards to online behavioral advertising across the Internet and mobile devices. To learn more about the Principles, and how to opt-out of Behavioral Advertising please go to [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

### User Content

Please note that whenever you publicly disclose information about yourself online (e.g., through email, social networking platforms, forums, message boards, chat areas, or similar web pages), such information may be collected, exported and used by people that you do not know. Posting personal information in public places may result in unsolicited communications, including unwanted email messages or other forms of contact. Always be smart about the information you provide online. We bear no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information you may disclose on the Sites.

### Personal Information

As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means information collected online about an individual that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity either alone, or in combination with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as a first and last name, a physical street address, an e-mail address, a telephone number, a social security number, or any other information that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual. You can browse the Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, there are certain features and services (including social networking) that may not be available for your use without providing Personal Information.

IONE may also use server logs and capture certain Non Personal Information such as the operating system being used, or the IP address or other unique identifiers, such as Device Identifiers (defined below). This Non Personal Information is generally used to help IONE plan system enhancements and understand which content and Services are compatible with users’ web browsing systems. It is also used to create anonymous reporting of Non Personal Information for internal and external clients; create aggregated portraits of the users of the Services that represent anonymous demographic information but not Personally Identifiable Information.
