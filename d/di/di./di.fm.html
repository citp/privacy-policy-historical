Please see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may be collected and how to opt-out. &nbsp;</li> <li>To show you ads on behalf of advertisers, we use information that you make available to us when you interact with the Platform (e.g. by listening, liking or adding to the “My Collection” section of the Platform), including location data, together with information you provide to us through the Platform, e.g. demographic information, you choose to make available to us directly or through third party services as well as information your browser sends us when using the Platform (e.g. referral URLs, device type or location data). This allows us to show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you. Please note that we do not share personal data with advertisers. Instead, advertisers pre-define a specific audience by certain generic criteria (e.g. the city of residence or the type of content&nbsp; listened to by an unidentified user) for a specific ad campaign. If your profile matches these generic criteria, we may choose to display a suitable ad to you. We may also display ads based on the content that you have recently viewed or searched. Before we may use location data from the app for the first time, your mobile device will generally ask you for permission first. In case you gave permission to do so, location based services in your device will collect location data for a couple of seconds. These will then be shared with us or a respective service provider. When we engage third party services such as ad-networks that enable us showing you interest based ads, we may also allow them to collect certain information such as cookie data from you. This information would allow these third-parties to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. If you allow third party websites to collect and share data when you interact with their platform, ad-networks may use that information together with the information we allow them to collect on the Platform. Please see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may be collected and how to opt-out.</li> <li>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may send to you from time to time. For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the proposed use of your personal data.</li> </ul> <h3>Use Of Anonymous Information</h3> <p>We use Anonymous Information to help us determine how people use parts of the Platform and who our users are so we can improve our Platform and ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible. We also use Anonymous Information to provide statistical "ratings" information in aggregated form to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Platform. We may also use or share Anonymous Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary.</p> <h3>Third-Party Agents</h3> <p>We have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners, that perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting, billing, marketing, analytics, providing customer service, fraud protection, advertising services, etc. These entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information. They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Platform.</p> <h3>Transactional Partners</h3> <p>We may share non-personal information with our partners and others from time to time.

We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our Platform in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy. We will never, however, materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information we have previously collected without your express consent.</p> <h3>Withdrawing consent, Opting Out or Correcting Information</h3> <p>You can withdraw your consent to the manner in which your data is used by the Company at any time.

The Australian DJ, record producer and musician at first used the term somewhat jokingly, but it caught on quickly and is now known around the world and heard every summer at top music festivals like Tomorrowland. In addition to Thomas Jack, the style was made popular by artists like Kygo, Matoma, Lost Frequencies, Seeb, and Klingande.

This music is only for the hardest of hardcore Techno fans and not recommended for the faint-of-anything. Born in the late 80’s out of an ultra-industrial form of Belgian New Beat techno, Gabber found a home in Rotterdam, whose gritty fans embraced it as an opposition anthem to the more pretentious house scene in Amsterdam. Gabber music is characterized by highly distorted bass drum samples, scathing synths, and relentless percussion. It’s been called the ‘death metal’ of electronic music and has such a zealous following that there are apparently dating sites dedicated solely to those whose ears are tuned for Gabber’s smashing sounds. While Gabber is best served loudly in an abandoned warehouse somewhere in the Netherlands, the DI.FM Gabber channel is your next best option, curated by one of its most dedicated fans and updated regularly to bring you the latest and greatest each day.","description_short":"The hardest form of techno with punishing tracks designed to drive the crowds into a sweaty frenzy.","favorite":false,"id":16,"images":{"compact":"//cdn-images.audioaddict.com/d/5/2/d/a/8/d52da8b4a1916421c2f3e9eb67293282.jpg{?size,height,width,quality,pad}","default":"//cdn-images.audioaddict.com/d/a/f/c/e/d/dafced37829e69724be99dc375bc5713.jpg{?size,height,width,quality,pad}","horizontal_banner":"//cdn-images.audioaddict.com/3/b/0/0/6/3/3b0063ee5cded1c15a0326fe812b091f.jpg{?size,height,width,quality,pad}"},"key":"gabber","name":"Gabber","network_id":1,"premium_id":0,"public":false,"similar_channels":[{"id":210,"similar_channel_id":9},{"id":211,"similar_channel_id":60},{"id":212,"similar_channel_id":276}],"tracklist_server_id":25615,"updated_at":"2019-12-02T09:23:46-05:00"},{"ad_channels":"","ad_dfp_unit_id":"radio_di_glitchhop","artists":[{"asset_url":null,"id":285820,"images":{},"name":"Stepcat"},{"asset_url":null,"id":44247,"images":{},"name":"Rameses B"},{"asset_url":null,"id":35452,"images":{},"name":"Defunk"},{"asset_url":null,"id":285817,"images":{},"name":"MantisMash"},{"asset_url":null,"id":52108,"images":{},"name":"GRiZ"},{"asset_url":null,"id":239470,"images":{},"name":"Royal Blood"},{"asset_url":null,"id":315352,"images":{},"name":" Datsik"},{"asset_url":null,"id":520597,"images":{},"name":"Collide Neo"},{"asset_url":null,"id":283578,"images":{},"name":"Will & Tim"},{"asset_url":null,"id":88001,"images":{},"name":"Dysphemic"}],"asset_id":122497,"asset_url":"//cdn-images.audioaddict.com/7/3/5/a/b/b/735abb160f950c98e2bd7caf6843e255.png","banner_url":"//cdn-images.audioaddict.com/e/3/b/d/7/1/e3bd712ca95ae861f09c0f7159c3d09f.png","channel_director":"DI.FM Staff","created_at":"2012-11-14T08:23:10-05:00","description":"The sound of digital malfunctions, electric hum and bit rate distortions perfectly placed alongside laid-back hip hop beats.","description_long":"Glitches don’t have to be frustrating – they can be soothing, electrifying, and explorative all at the same time.

With a history that can be tracked back as early as the 1970s – before the explosion of artistic creativity that brought us many of electronic music’s more nuanced styles – Hardcore Techno boasts a true OG status in the genre, although the style is said to have become more officially defined much later-on in the early 90s. The music stands apart from mainstream Techno with faster tempos in the 160 – 200+ bpm range, and a heavily industrial sound that gives it a much more aggressive and gritty sound. Like the rest of Techno’s darker sounds, it was born out of the Belgian New Beat industrial style of Techno.

Hardstyle was developed around the turn of the century as a more crowd-pleasing alternative to Hardcore, Hard House, and Gabber which were too industrial, repetitive, fast and invasive for many clubs and rave scenes. The music fuses elements of Hard House, Hard Trance, and Hardcore and is most notably defined by the inclusion of reverse bass, heavy kick bass, and screeches. Dedicated fans will tell you that tempos increased from the 135-150 bpm range in the early Hardstyle days to the 150-160 bpm range that’s more commonly heard today. High-tempo melodies bring the tracks to life and create the euphoric effect that revelers love while still maintaining deep roots in the industrial grit of EDM.

In many ways, the story of House is the story of Chicago itself – a gritty mixture of musical styles and cultures, influenced by a hard and diverse windy city that almost demands new things to evolve out of the old. DJs seeking fresh sounds for the club scene sampled the sounds around them including rap, jazz, Latin music, synth pop, and more, setting them to the repetitive four-on-the-floor rhythms and deep basslines that define House music to this day.

Robotic, mechanical and full of soul, always facing the future.","description_long":"Techno music was born in the gritty, hard-working city of Detroit in the mid-to-late 1980s. It’s robotic and mechanical with artists using electronic instruments including synthesizers, drum machines, and sequencers to achieve the desired industrial sounds that define the genre. At the same time, Techno maintains its soul with the melding of the futuristic, techy sounds with electropop, house, and funk. Tempo is usually kept at a healthy 120 to 150 bpm, with most tracks learning toward the more heart-racing paces. A unique characteristic of Techno is that much of the music is produced for use in a continuous DJ set, which explains why this channel also offers a library in the hundreds of mix shows to enjoy.  Tune in to the DI.FM Techno Channel to hear arguably one of the world’s greatest collections of exceptional Techno tracks from the U.S., U.K., Germany, and beyond.","description_short":"Techno is a true musical force full of structure and style.
