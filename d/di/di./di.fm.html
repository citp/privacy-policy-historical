For information about how to change your settings, and to unsubscribe from newsletters, marketing messages and email notifications, please see the “Email Settings” tab in the “My Account” section of your account on the Platform.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li> <li>To help us personalize and continually improve your experience on the Platform.&nbsp; We use the information from one website on other websites in our network of partnering websites which together constitute the "Digitally Imported Network" forming the Platform operated by Digitally Imported, Inc. and owned by the entities set out above.</li> <li>To enable third parties to carry out technical, analytical, logistical, advertising or other functions on our behalf.&nbsp;</li> <li>Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to the Platform or your Personal Information collected online to any companies not affiliated with us.</li> <li>In the event we plan to publicly post any of your Personal Information on a Website (as, for instance, a letter), we will request your permission to provide such posting.</li> </ul> <p>Improving and customizing the Platform and advertising:</p> <ul> <li>To analyze the use of the Platform, and the people visiting the Platform, in order to improve DI and customize it to your needs and interests.</li> <li>To show you interesting DI ads, when you visit third party websites or use other apps with in-app advertising. When you see our ads on a third party website or apps, we or third party services we engage for this purpose, may collect information your browser or mobile app makes available when seeing the ad (e.g. ip-addresses, referral URL, browser details, timestamp of request). Third party websites or apps may also allow us to measure the success of our ads on their websites. This may include for example whether a click converted to an actual purchase of a Subscription. Please see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may be collected and how to opt-out. &nbsp;</li> <li>To show you ads on behalf of advertisers, we use information that you make available to us when you interact with the Platform (e.g. by listening, liking or adding to the “My Collection” section of the Platform), including location data, together with information you provide to us through the Platform, e.g. demographic information, you choose to make available to us directly or through third party services as well as information your browser sends us when using the Platform (e.g. referral URLs, device type or location data). This allows us to show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you. Please note that we do not share personal data with advertisers. Instead, advertisers pre-define a specific audience by certain generic criteria (e.g. the city of residence or the type of content&nbsp; listened to by an unidentified user) for a specific ad campaign. If your profile matches these generic criteria, we may choose to display a suitable ad to you. We may also display ads based on the content that you have recently viewed or searched. Before we may use location data from the app for the first time, your mobile device will generally ask you for permission first. In case you gave permission to do so, location based services in your device will collect location data for a couple of seconds. These will then be shared with us or a respective service provider. When we engage third party services such as ad-networks that enable us showing you interest based ads, we may also allow them to collect certain information such as cookie data from you. This information would allow these third-parties to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. If you allow third party websites to collect and share data when you interact with their platform, ad-networks may use that information together with the information we allow them to collect on the Platform. Please see the privacy policy of such third party websites to understand what data may be collected and how to opt-out.</li> <li>To customize your use of the Platform and/or the content of any email newsletter or other material that we may send to you from time to time. For other purposes, provided we disclose this to you at the relevant time, and provided that you agree to the proposed use of your personal data.</li> </ul> <h3>Use Of Anonymous Information</h3> <p>We use Anonymous Information to help us determine how people use parts of the Platform and who our users are so we can improve our Platform and ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible. We also use Anonymous Information to provide statistical "ratings" information in aggregated form to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Platform. We may also use or share Anonymous Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary.</p> <h3>Third-Party Agents</h3> <p>We have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners, that perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting, billing, marketing, analytics, providing customer service, fraud protection, advertising services, etc. These entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information. They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Platform.</p> <h3>Transactional Partners</h3> <p>We may share non-personal information with our partners and others from time to time.

We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our Platform in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy. We will never, however, materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information we have previously collected without your express consent.</p> <h3>Withdrawing consent, Opting Out or Correcting Information</h3> <p>You can withdraw your consent to the manner in which your data is used by the Company at any time.
