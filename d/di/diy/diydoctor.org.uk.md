This policy explains in detail how “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums” along with its affiliated companies (hereinafter “we”, “us”, “our”, “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums”, “http://www.diydoctor.org.uk/forums”) and phpBB (hereinafter “they”, “them”, “their”, “phpBB software”, “www.phpbb.com”, “phpBB Group”, “phpBB Teams”) use any information collected during any session of usage by you (hereinafter “your information”).

A third cookie will be created once you have browsed topics within “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums” and is used to store which topics have been read, thereby improving your user experience.

We may also create cookies external to the phpBB software whilst browsing “diydoctor.org.uk DIY and Home Improvement Forums”, though these are outside the scope of this document which is intended to only cover the pages created by the phpBB software.
