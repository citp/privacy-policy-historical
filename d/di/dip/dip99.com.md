> _Information We May Collect_
> 
> Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email address. In general, you can visit the Site and use its search engine and other features without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, in order to access certain information, services or features contained on the Site, we may require you to provide Personal Information. For example, we will collect certain Personal Information if you choose to subscribe to our mailing list or send questions or comments to us via e-mail.
> 
> _How We May Use Your Information_
> 
> If you provide us with Personal Information, we may retain and use that information for several purposes. For example, we may use your Personal Information in order to process and fulfill any transactions or services that you request, such as responding to your questions or sending e-mails to our mailing list subscribers. We may also use Personal Information to ensure compliance with our policies and applicable law. In addition, we may send you periodic communications by e-mail or regular mail, such as special offers or information on our services. If you wish to opt out of receiving e-mail communications from us at any time, simply follow the instructions for doing so in the e-mails that you receive from us.

> _With Whom We May Share Your Information_
> 
> If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Site, we may transfer that information within Dip99.com. We may store and process Personal Information collected on our Site in the United States or any other country in which Dip99.com or its agents maintain facilities. By using our Site and services, you consent to the transfer of your information among these facilities, including those located outside your country. Third parties provide certain services available on the Site on Dip99.com's behalf. For example, Service providers are an important means by which Dip99.com maintains the Site and our mailing lists. Dip99.com may provide information, including Personal Information that Dip99.com collects on the Site, to third-party service providers to help us deliver programs, products, information, and services. Dip99.com will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on Dip99.com's behalf.
> 
> As Dip99.com develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that Dip99.com or all of its assets are acquired, customer information would be one of the transferred assets.
> 
> We reserve the right to disclose visitor information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other visitors, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We also reserve the right to disclose visitor information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
> 
> Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we do not currently intend to share your Personal Information with any third parties without obtaining your consent. However, we may decide to do so in the future, in which case we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.
> 
> Aggregate Information
> 
> From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site and our search engine, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which search results or other hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. We collect this information through the use of "cookies" and other tracking technologies, which are discussed in greater detail below. We collect this information in order to determine which areas of the Site, search terms and search results are most popular and to enhance the Site for visitors. We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site and our search engine to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in response to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to the Site.

> _Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies_
> 
> Some of our web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A cookie is a small text file that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies may be used, for example, to collect information about website activity. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. However, please be aware that some features of the Site may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other third parties with links on the Site. We do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
> 
> Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our Site is accessed. We do not link the information we record using tracking technologies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
> 
> Search Engine
> 
> When you use our search engine, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies described above. For example, when you use our search engine, we may keep track of which search terms are popular. If we display advertising to you on the Site (including the search results pages displayed after any searches you may run), such advertising may be related to the search terms you entered. Dip99.com may present search result links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed and may monitor click-throughs on an individual and an aggregate basis. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of Dip99.com's search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.
> 
> Certain search results may be "premium" results, which consist of websites who have paid for placement in the search results. These listings are provided by our business partners. These premium results may contain tracking URLs provided by our partners to identify clicks from the search results page. Again, information gathered by these means will not personally identify you. Any information collected by our partners will be subject to their privacy policy.
> 
> Links to Other Sites
> 
> Please be aware that when you are on the Site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, when you use our search engine, the search results will provide links to other sites from the Site's pages that take you outside the Site. These other sites may send their own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit Personal Information. The privacy policies of these other sites may be significantly different from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your Personal Information collected there.
> 
> Security
> 
> Wherever your Personal Information may be held within Dip99.com or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your Personal Information.
