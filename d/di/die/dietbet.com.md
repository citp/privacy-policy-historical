We all care about how our personal information is used and shared, especially when it comes to private weight information, and we want you to know that we keep your private information private. Please read below to learn how we go about this. 

By visiting the DietBet website (including any related websites we control), you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

If you have any questions concerning our privacy policy, contact us. 

#### What this Policy Covers.

This Privacy Policy covers DietBet’s treatment of personal information that DietBet gathers when you are using the DietBet website and when you use DietBet’s services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that DietBet does not own or control, or to individuals that DietBet does not employ or manage. 

#### Information Collected by DietBet.

We collect the following types of information from our users: 

  * Information You Provide to Us. We receive and store information that you enter on our website or provide to us in other ways. You can choose not to submit certain information; the tradeoff is that you may not be able to take advantage of certain of our site’s features. 
    * Registration: In order for you to use DietBet services you must create an account by completing a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require select personal information (including your name, email address, etc.). 
    * User Profile: To allow you to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration, we enable you to provide additional information in your User Profile, this information may include your location, your birth date, your weight, your diet practices, and other interests. You may also post photos. 
    * Player Profile: To play DietBet a user may supply personal information such as their weight, target weight, age, gender, bet amount, etc. In some cases, DietBet will also collect payment information (such as credit card number, expiration date, or bank account numbers for Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers). 
    * Tell-A-Friend: A user may choose to identify a friend, colleague, cheerleader, or similar third party through our Challenge, Referee, or Cheerleader functions. If a user does this we will collect the recipient’s email address. We will automatically send your friend an email, and if necessary, reminder email(s). DietBet stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this email and any related reminder emails and tracking the success of our invitation programs. Your friend may Contact Us to request that we remove this information from our database. 
    * Orders: If you purchase a product or service through DietBet, then we will collect billing information (such as credit card number, expiration date, or bank account numbers) and address information (such as name, email address, and shipping address). 
    * Bulletin Boards, Blogs, Chatrooms. If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chatroom on DietBet, you should be aware that personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for such personally identifiable information that you choose to submit in these forums. We also connect to third-party services like Facebook and Twitter and information you post on our site may be sent off our site via these third-party services. 
  * Automatic Information. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. DietBet and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, DietBet cookie information, queries and the page you requested. DietBet uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website. DietBet may collect and, on any page, display various aggregate counts of the times that pages have been viewed. This includes User Profile pages. 



Use of information by DietBet. DietBet uses your information to contact you about your involvement or potential involvement in a game; to bill users who have agreed to play or purchase products through our site; to fulfill product orders; to contact you about DietBet-related news, features, products, surveys, promotions, updates, case-studies, and/or special offers; to facilitate social networking and game set-up (e.g. posting on your Facebook feed, sending friend requests and notifications, creating groups of users with similar goals, or Referee and Cheerleader requests); to serve ads tailored to your stated interests and goals; and, without using personally identifiable information, to analyze and report success trends. 

#### Email Communications.

  * Based upon the personally identifiable information that you provide to us, we will send you a welcome email after you have registered with DietBet. DietBet also sends out emails in response to your inquiries, message board posts, to manage your account, and to facilitate the actions described above in the “Use of information by DietBet” section. You may receive notification emails from DietBet, which inform you of actions performed on the site (e.g. Cheerleader requests and notifications). Unless you opt out, we also send motivational newsletters and messages to people playing in our games (e.g., our Daily Carrot newsletter, coaching messages). 
  * If you do not want to receive email from us, email [unsubscribe@dietbet.com](mailto:unsubscribe@dietbet.com) from the email address you want to take off our lists. However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive certain system emails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords and related to success and failure in on-going games you have engaged in) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us. If you wish to stop receiving these emails you may deactivate or suspend your account. 
  * If you have provided us information to invite a third party to the site or to be your Referee or Cheerleader, then we will automatically send that third party email inviting him or her to visit the site. Your friend may contact us here or through the link on the bottom of the email to request that we remove their information from our database. 



#### Cookies.

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for the purpose of record-keeping. We use cookies to identify our registered users and to store session specific information including your username. At the user’s option, our cookies may remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time to facilitate login. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 
  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Although you may reject our cookies and still use our site, we recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of DietBet’s best features. 
  * We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and to control access to certain parts of our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. 
  * Our vendors and affiliates also use cookies to enable their systems to recognize your browser and tell them how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people; that information, which is provided to us, is not personally identifiable. In addition, some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access to or control over these cookies. The use of cookies by these third parties is not covered under our privacy statement. 
  * Cookies, while delicious, are not conducive to winning your DietBet, except and unless served to your competitors. 



#### Online Advertising.

  * We use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements when you visit our site. These companies may use cookies, pixel tags, and other methods to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our and other websites to provide you with advertisements about products, services, and events that may be of interest to the user. 
  * If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here to visit the Network Advertising Initiative's website. You can also learn how to opt out of third-party advertisers' tracking methods in conjunction with links, online ads, etc. by visiting the advertisers' sites. 



#### Sharing Your Information.

Because DietBet enables people to discover and share information with one another, information about the people who use DietBet is an integral part of the DietBet experience. Although we may share non-personal information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information, and website usage information with third parties, rest assured that we will share your personally identifiable information only as described below. 

  * DietBet Personnel and Affiliates: DietBet personnel, approved academic researchers, authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of DietBet business and/or research. This means that user information, including name, address, phone number, credit card details and Commitment Contract details may be used for the following reasons: responding to user requests, ensuring smooth operation of games, and/or modifying our games product to increase users’ success rates. We may solicit your participation in research and in developing case-studies and success stories. 
  * We may also use your personal information to place you in a Full-Service Game with strangers who match your weight, age, gender categories and/or who share certain interests, such as playing against other recent mothers or diabetics. Being placed in a Full-Service Game may thus imply certain private information about you even if this information is not made explicitly public (such as the fact that you’re a diabetic or a new mother). We do this in order to match you with other people in similar conditions and to make a better, more enjoyable game. 
  * Agents/Service Providers: DietBet employ third parties to perform functions on our behalf; examples include hosting or operating the DietBet website, fulfilling orders for products and services purchased through the DietBet websites, sending e-mail and/or other communications, providing wireless services, removing repetitive information from customer lists, data analysis, marketing assistance, credit card payment processing, and customer service. These third parties may have access to your personal information for the purpose of performing such functions on the DietBet’s behalf. 
  * Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If DietBet or substantially all of its assets were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred. 
  * Protection of DietBet and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of DietBet, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We also reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on DietBet. 
  * User Profile information: Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be displayed to other DietBet users in your User Profile. The User Profile is the area on DietBet where we allow you to tell other DietBet users about yourself and your interests. You may control what personal information is displayed in your User Profile. In general, your weight may be disclosed to other users though you may opt to only show your relative weight (i.e., we may tell other players that you weigh 150 pounds; however, if you prefer, you can check a box that tells us to only share with them the fact that you’ve gained or lost 2 pounds since your last weigh-in). 
  * API: DietBet will allow third parties access to all DietBet data that is already publicly available through the DietBet website. DietBet will keep passwords private. 
  * E-Commerce: DietBet may allow users to choose to share information with third parties, including marketers or electronic commerce providers through on-site offers. 
  * Affiliate Entities: DietBet may also provide your personally identifiable information to your affiliated company if you have entered an Affiliate Code during registration or are otherwise a user of our corporate portal. 
  * With Your Consent: Except as noted above, DietBet will not provide users' personally identifiable information to third parties or use it for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected without their prior permission. 



#### Keeping Information Secure.

  * The security of your information is of paramount importance to us. Your DietBet account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. In addition, we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information of our users, both during transmission and after we receive it. DietBet strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, including use of encryption, firewalls, and hashing on select types of information collected by DietBet. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers or bank account information) during the sign-up process or on our order forms, we encrypt your information during transmission using 128 bit secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure, however, so DietBet cannot guarantee absolute security. 
  * You can enhance your security by protecting against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer. 
  * Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices. 



#### Ways to Control Display and Use of Your Information.

  * You can always opt not to disclose information, but then you may be unable to use certain features on our website. 
  * By visiting your User Profile, you can correct, amend, add, or delete personally identifiable information on our website. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records as part of our normal back-up procedures and so that we can comply with any future requests for such information in conjunction with future legal proceedings. 
  * If you wish to remain a user of DietBet, but do not wish to receive certain email from us or other DietBet users, please email [unsubscribe@dietbet.com](mailto:unsubscribe@dietbet.com) . However, please note that you will continue to receive all system emails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us. 
  * You may request access to any Personal Information that we have collected that is not available on your User Profile page so that you may correct any inaccuracies or request deletion of that information; we will respond to your request within 15 business days. 
  * You may also request deletion of your DietBet account by Contacting Us. We will respond to requests within 15 business days. 



#### Children.

  * 13 to 18 Years of Age. We recommend that children age 13 to 18 talk with their parents before posting information about themselves on the Internet or playing in competitive diet games such as DietBet. 
  * Under 13 Years of Age. Children under age 13 are prohibited from registering to use the DietBet website. If you are under 13 years old, please do not attempt to register with this site or send any information about yourself to us. DietBet does not knowingly allow users under age 13 to register nor does DietBet knowingly collect information about children under age 13. If we learn that DietBet has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as reasonably possible. If you believe that DietBet may have information from or about a child under 13 years old, please contact us. 



Changes to this Privacy Policy. DietBet may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole discretion. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make material changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by posting an announcement on the DietBet website so you are may stay up-to-date on what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed. 

Conditions of Use. If you decide to visit DietBet’s website, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of California law. 

Effective Date of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 1, 2011.
