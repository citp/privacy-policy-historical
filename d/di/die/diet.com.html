		<span class="blue">Diet.com has numerous security measures in place to protect you from the loss, 
		misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including personal credit card 
		information if you choose to conduct an e-commerce transaction through the Diet.com Sites. To help 
		ensure the integrity and privacy of all of your information provided to us via the Internet, we 
		use Secured Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in transmitting such information over the 
		Internet to our servers. We secure your information provided to us on servers located in controlled, 
		secure environments, protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration. Only employees on a 
		need to know basis have access to your information to perform a specific task or function. Our 
		employees must abide by this Privacy Policy, are kept up-to-date on security practices, and 
		execute written agreements with us to protect private and confidential information. We will meet 
		a violation of this Privacy Policy by an employee with disciplinary action. Notwithstanding the 
		foregoing, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information 
		over the Internet. There is also a risk that others may find a way to break through our security 
		systems. We strive to protect your information but do not ensure the security and privacy of any 
		information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="blue">Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use Personally 
		Identifiable Information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we 
		request such information from you.</span>
		<br>

		<span class="blue">You can always contact us in order to (1) update or correct your Personally 
		Identifiable Information, or (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other 
		information you receive from us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@diet.com">privacy@diet.com</a>. 
		Such updates, corrections, changes, and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we 
		maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy 
		prior to such update, correction, change, or deletion.</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="blue">You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and 
		every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back-up our 
		systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally Identifiable 
		Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. 
		We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored 
		in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed, 
		or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable.</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="blue">If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our Sites so you 
		are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, 
		we disclose it. The Policy will include the most recent date in which any revision has been made. We 
		may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect our use of 
		your Personally Identifiable Information. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, 
		you should not use our Website.</span>
