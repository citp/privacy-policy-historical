  <div class="ct-container">
    <h3>What this Policy Covers.</h3>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy covers DietBet's treatment of personal information  that DietBet gathers when you are using the DietBet website and also when you  use DietBet's services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third  parties that DietBet does not own or control, or to individuals that DietBet  does not employ or manage.

<!-- Info Collected -->

<div class="content">
  <div class="ct-container">
    <h3>Information Collected by DietBet.</h3>
    <p>
      We collect the following  types of information from our users:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Information You Provide to  Us. We receive and store information that you enter on our website or provide  to us in other ways. You can choose not to submit certain information, but the  tradeoff is that you may not be able to take advantage of certain of our site's  features.
        <ol>
          <li>Registration: In order for  you to use DietBet services you must create an account by completing a  registration form. As part of this registration form, we require select  personal information (including your name, email address, etc.).</li>
          <li>User Profile: To allow you  to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration,  we enable you to provide additional information in your User Profile. This  information may include your location, your birth date, your weight, your diet  practices, and other interests. You may also post photos in your Profile.</li>
          <li>Player Profile: To play  DietBet, a user may supply personal information such as their weight, target  weight, age, gender, bet amount, etc. In some cases, DietBet will also collect  payment information (such as credit card number, expiration date, or bank  account numbers for Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers).</li>
          <li>Invite Friends: A user may choose to identify a friend, colleague, cheerleader, or a similar third party through our invite-a-friend and cheerleader functions, respectfully.  If a  user does this we will collect the recipient's email address. We will automatically send your friend an email, and if necessary, reminder emails.  DietBet stores this information for the sole purpose of sending the  aformentioned email and any related reminder emails. We also store this  information to track the success of our invitation programs. Your friend may  contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.</li>
          <li>Orders. If you purchase a  product or service through DietBet, then we will collect billing information (such  as credit card number, expiration date, or bank account numbers) and address  information (such as name, email address, and shipping address).</li>
          <li>Weigh-In Photos: In order to play, each player must submit two weigh-in photos at the beginning and end of each game.  These photos are solely used by our DietBet Referees to confirm a player's starting and ending weight and are not shared or posted.  DietBet does not use these photos for any purpose other than weigh-in review without express written permission of the player.  After they are reviewed, the images are stored in our database for auditing purposes since they are used to determine winners of the game.</li>
          <li>Bulletin Boards, Blogs,  Chatrooms. If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chatroom on DietBet, you  should be aware that personally identifiable information you submit there can  be read, collected, or used by other users of the aforesaid forums. This  information could then be used by a third party to send you unsolicited  messages. We are not responsible for such personally identifiable information  that you choose to submit in the forums. We also connect to third-party  services like Facebook and Twitter, and any information that you post on our  site may be sent off our site via these third-party services.</li>
          <li>Automatic Information. We  receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.  DietBet and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain  traffic data on their server logs from your browser including your IP address,  DietBet cookie information, queries, and the page you requested. DietBet uses  this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, to analyze trends  and to administrate the website. DietBet may collect and display various  aggregate counts of the times that pages have been viewed. This includes User  Profile pages.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Use of information by  DietBet. DietBet uses your information to contact you about your involvement or  potential involvement in a game; to bill users who have agreed to play or  purchase products through our site; to fulfill product orders; to contact you  about DietBet-related news, features, products, surveys, promotions, updates,  case-studies, and/or special offers; to facilitate social networking and game  set-up (e.g. posting on your Facebook feed, sending friend requests and  notifications, creating groups of users with similar goals, or Referee and  Cheerleader requests); to serve ads tailored to your stated interests and  goals; and, without using personally identifiable information, to analyze and  report success trends.

<!-- Email Communications -->

<div class="content">
  <div class="ct-container">
    <h3>Email Communications.</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>We will send you a welcome  email after you have registered with DietBet&nbsp;  based upon the personally identifiable information that you provide us.  DietBet also sends out emails to respond to your inquiries and you message  board posts, to manage your account, and to facilitate the actions described  above in the "Use of information by DietBet" section. You may receive  notification emails from DietBet, which inform you of actions performed on the  site (e.g., activity posts and notifications). Unless you opt out, we also  send motivational newsletters and messages to people playing in our games  (e.g., our Daily Carrot newsletter, coaching messages).</li>
      <li>If you do not want to  receive email from us, email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:unsubscribe@dietbet.com">unsubscribe@dietbet.com</a>&nbsp;from the email address you want to take off our lists. However,  please note that in all cases you will continue to receive certain system  emails (e.g. regarding forgotten user passwords or related to success and  failure in on-going games you have engaged in) and legal notices (e.g. updates  to our policies) from us. If you wish to stop receiving these emails you may  deactivate or suspend your account.</li>
      <li>If you have provided us  information to invite a third party to the site or to be your Referee or  Cheerleader, then we will automatically send that third party email inviting  him or her to visit the site. Your friend may contact us or click through the link on the bottom of the email to request that we remove their information  from our database.</li>

  <div class="ct-container">
    <h3>Sharing Your Information.</h3>
    <p>
      DietBet enables  people to discover and share information with one another, and information  about the people who use DietBet is very important to us. Although we may share  non-personal information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic  information, and website usage information with third parties, rest assured  that we will share your personally identifiable information only as described  below.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>DietBet Personnel and Affiliates:  DietBet personnel, approved academic researchers, authorized consultants and/or  contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal  course of DietBet business and/or research. This means that user information,  including name, address, phone number, credit card details and Commitment  Contract details may be used for the following reasons: responding to user  requests, ensuring smooth operation of games, and/or modifying our games  product to increase users' success rates. We may solicit your participation in  research, developing case-studies, and success stories.</li>
      <li>We may also use your  personal information to place you in a game with other players who  match your weight, age, gender categories and/or who share certain interests,  such as playing against other recent mothers or diabetics. Being placed in such a game may thus imply certain private information about you even  though this information is not made explicitly public. We do this in order to  match you with other people in similar conditions and to make a better, more  enjoyable game.</li>
      <li>Agents/Service Providers:  DietBet employs third parties to perform functions on our behalf. Examples  include hosting or operating the DietBet website, fulfilling orders for products  and services purchased through the DietBet websites, sending e-mail and/or  other communications, providing wireless services, removing repetitive  information from customer lists, data analysis, marketing assistance, credit  card payment processing, and customer service. These third parties may have  access to your personal information for the purpose of performing such  functions on DietBet's behalf.</li>
      <li>Business Transfers: In some  cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions,  user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.  If DietBet or all of its assets were acquired, user information would be one of  the assets that is transferred.</li>
      <li>Protection of DietBet and  Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that  release is necessary to comply with the law; to enforce our Terms of Use; or to  protect the rights, property, or safety of DietBet, our employees, our users,  or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and  organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We also reserve  the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by  law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights  and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served  on DietBet.</li>
      <li>User Profile information:  Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your  full name and location, may be displayed to other DietBet users in your User  Profile. The User Profile is the area on DietBet where we allow you to tell  other DietBet users about yourself and your interests. You may control what personal information is displayed in your User Profile including your weight. You have the option to disclose your weight, or hide it and only show your relative weight (i.e., we may tell other players that you weigh 150 pounds; however, if you prefer, you can check a box that tells us to only share with them that you've gained or lost 2 pounds since your last weigh-in).</li>
      <li>API: DietBet will allow  third parties access to all DietBet data that is already publicly available  through the DietBet website. DietBet will keep passwords private.</li>
      <li>E-Commerce: DietBet may  allow users to choose to share information with third parties, including  marketers or electronic commerce providers through on-site offers.</li>
      <li>Affiliate Entities: DietBet  may also provide your personally identifiable information to your affiliated  company if you have entered an Affiliate Code during registration or are  otherwise a user of our corporate portal.</li>
      <li>With Your Consent: Except as noted above,  DietBet will not provide users' personally identifiable information to third  parties or use it for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it  was originally collected without their prior permission.</li>

    <h3>Keeping Information Secure.</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The security of your  information is of paramount importance to us. Your DietBet account information  is protected by a password for your privacy and security. In addition, we  follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal  information of our users, both during transmission and after we receive it.  DietBet strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal  information, including use of encryption, firewalls, and hashing on select  types of information collected by DietBet. When you enter sensitive information  (such as credit card numbers or bank account information) during the sign-up  process or on our order forms, we encrypt your information during transmission  using 128 bit secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission  or electronic storage is 100% secure, however, so DietBet cannot guarantee  absolute security.</li>
      <li>You can enhance your  security by protecting against unauthorized access to your password and to your  computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.</li>
      <li>Only employees who need personal information to  perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are  granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy  and security practices.</li>
