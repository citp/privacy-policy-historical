    </p>
    <h3>What this Policy Covers</h3>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy covers DietBet's treatment of personal information that DietBet gathers when you are using the DietBet website and also when you use DietBet's services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that DietBet does not own or control, or to individuals that DietBet does not employ or manage.     
    </p>

<!-- Info Collected -->

<div class="content">
  <div class="ct-container">
    <h1>Information Collected by DietBet</h1>
    <p>
      We collect the following types of information from our users: 
    </p>
    <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
    <p>
      We receive and store information that you enter on our website or provide to us in other ways. You can choose not to submit certain information, but the tradeoff is that you may not be able to take advantage of certain of our site's features. 
    </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Registration:</b> In order for you to use DietBet services you must create an 
          account by completing a registration form. As part of this registration form, we 
          require select personal information (including your name, email address, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>User and Player Profiles:</b> To allow you to express yourself beyond just the 
          information collected during registration, we enable you to provide additional 
          information about yourself in your User Profile, including a profile photo.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Payment Information:</b> DietBet uses PCI-compliant payment processors and 
          does not itself see or store your credit card details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Invite Friends:</b> A user may choose to identify a friend, colleague, cheerleader, 
          or a similar third party through our invite-a-friend and cheerleader functions, 
          respectfully. If a user does this we will collect the recipient's email address. We 
          will automatically send your friend an email, and if necessary, reminder emails. 
          DietBet stores this information for the sole purpose of sending the 
          aformentioned email and any related reminder emails. We also store this 
          information to track the success of our invitation programs. Your friend may 
          contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Orders.</b>	If	you	purchase	a	product	or	service	through	DietBet,	we	will	collect
          standard information in	order	to	fulfill	your	order (such	as	name,	email	address,	
          and	shipping	address).
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Weigh-In Photos:</b> In order to play, each player must submit two weigh-in photos 
          at the beginning and end of each game. These photos are solely used by our 
          DietBet Referees to confirm a player's starting and ending weight. DietBet does 
          not use these photos for any purpose other than weigh-in review without 
          express written permission of the player. After they are reviewed, the images are 
          stored in our database for auditing purposes since they are used to determine 
          winners of the game. They are also displayed on your personal profile and 
          visible only to you, unless you choose to share them with others. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bulletin Boards, Blogs, Chatrooms.</b> If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chatroom 
          on DietBet, you should be aware that personally identifiable information you 
          submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of the aforesaid 
          forums. This information could then be used by a third party to send you 
          unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for such personally identifiable 
          information that you choose to submit in the forums. We also connect to third-party
          services like Facebook and Twitter, and any information that you post on 
          our site may be sent off our site via these third-party services with your consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Automatic Information.</b> We receive and store certain types of information 
          whenever you interact with us. DietBet and its authorized agents automatically 
          receive and record certain traffic data on their server logs from your browser 
          including your IP address, DietBet cookie information, queries, and the page you 
          requested. DietBet uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its 
          servers, to analyze trends, and to administer the website. DietBet may collect
          and display various aggregate counts of the times that pages have been viewed. 
        </li>
      </ol>
    <p>
      Use of information by DietBet. DietBet uses your information to contact you about your involvement or potential involvement in a game; to bill users who have agreed to play or purchase products through our site; to fulfill product orders; to contact you about DietBet-related news, features, products, surveys, promotions, updates, case-studies, and/or special offers; to facilitate social networking and game set-up (e.g. posting on your Facebook feed, sending friend requests and notifications, creating groups of users with similar goals, or Referee and Cheerleader requests); and, without using personally identifiable information, to analyze and report success trends.

<!-- Email Communications -->

<div class="content">
  <div class="ct-container">
    <h3>Email Communications</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        We will send you welcome emails after you have registered with DietBet based upon the personally identifiable information that you provide us. DietBet also sends out emails to respond to your inquiries and sometimes to your message board posts, to manage your account, and to facilitate the actions described above in the "Information You Provide to Us" section. You may receive notification emails from DietBet, which inform you of actions performed on the site (e.g., activity posts and notifications). Unless you opt out, we also send motivational newsletters and messages to people playing in our games (e.g., our Daily Carrot newsletter, coaching messages).
      </li>
      <li>
        If you do not want to receive email from us, email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:unsubscribe@dietbet.com">unsubscribe@dietbet.com</a> from the email address you want to take off our lists. However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive certain system emails (e.g. regarding forgotten user passwords or related to success and failure in on-going games you have engaged in) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us. If you wish to stop receiving these emails you may deactivate or suspend your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have provided us information to invite a third party, we will automatically send that third party email inviting him or her to visit the site. Your friend may contact us or click through the link on the bottom of the email to request that we remove their information from our database.

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for the purpose of record-keeping. We use cookies to identify our registered users and to store session specific information, such as your username. At the user's option, our cookies may remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time to facilitate login. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
      </li>
      <li>
        The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Although you may reject our cookies and still navigate some areas of our site, we require you to have cookies activated in order to participate in a game.
      </li>
      <li>
        We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and to control access to certain parts of our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience of our site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our vendors and affiliates also use cookies to enable their systems to recognize your browser and tell them how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. That information, which is provided to us, is not personally identifiable. In addition, some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access to or control over these cookies. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered under our privacy statement.

      <li>
        Cookies, while delicious, are not conducive to winning your DietBet, except and unless served to your competitors.

<!-- Sharing Info -->

<div class="content">
  <div class="ct-container">
    <h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
    <p>
      DietBet enables people to discover and share information with one another, and information about the people who use DietBet is very important to us. Although we may share non-personal information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information, and website usage information with third parties, rest assured that we will share your personally identifiable information only as described below. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        DietBet Personnel and Affiliates: DietBet personnel, approved academic 
        researchers, authorized consultants and/or contractors, and payment 
        processing companies may have access to user information if necessary in 
        the normal course of DietBet business and/or research. This means that user 
        information, including name, address, phone number, credit card details may
        be used for the following reasons: responding to user requests, ensuring 
        smooth operation of games, and/or modifying our games product to increase 
        users' success rates. We may solicit your participation in research, 
        developing case-studies, and success stories.
      </li>
      <li>
        We may also use your personal information to place you in a game with other players who match your weight, age, gender categories and/or who share certain interests, such as playing against other recent mothers or diabetics. Being placed in such a game may thus imply certain private information about you even though this information is not made explicitly public. We do this in order to match you with other people in similar conditions and to make a better, more enjoyable game.
      </li>
      <li>
        Agents/Service Providers: DietBet employs third parties to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting or operating the DietBet website, fulfilling orders for products and services purchased through the DietBet websites, sending e-mail and/or other communications, providing wireless services, removing repetitive information from customer lists, data analysis, marketing assistance, credit card payment processing, and customer service. These third parties may have access to your personal information for the purpose of performing such functions on DietBet's behalf.
      </li>
      <li>
        Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If DietBet or all of its assets were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protection of DietBet and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; to enforce our Terms of Use; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of DietBet, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We also reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on DietBet.
      </li>
      <li>
        User Profile information: Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be displayed to other DietBet users in your User Profile. The User Profile is the area on DietBet where we allow you to tell other DietBet users about yourself and your interests. You may control what personal information is displayed in your User Profile including your weight. You have the option to disclose your weight, or hide it and only show your relative weight (i.e., we may tell other players that you weigh 150 pounds; however, if you prefer, you can check a box that tells us to only share with them that you've gained or lost 2 pounds since your last weigh-in).
      </li>
      <li>
        API: DietBet will allow third parties access to all DietBet data that is already publicly available through the DietBet website. DietBet will keep passwords private. 
      </li>
      <li>
        E-Commerce: DietBet may allow users to choose to share information with third parties, including marketers or electronic commerce providers through on-site offers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Affiliate Entities: DietBet may also provide your personally identifiable information to your affiliated company if you have entered an Affiliate Code during registration or are otherwise a user of our corporate portal.
      </li>
      <li>
        With Your Consent: Except as noted above, DietBet will not provide users' personally identifiable information to third parties or use it for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected without their prior permission.

    <h3>Keeping Information Secure</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The security of your information is of paramount importance to us. Your DietBet account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. In addition, we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information of our users, both during transmission and after we receive it. DietBet strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, including use of encryption, firewalls, and hashing on select types of information collected by DietBet. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) during the sign-up process or on our order forms, we encrypt your information during transmission using 128 bit secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure, however, so DietBet cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can enhance your security by protecting against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.

        By visiting your User Profile, you can correct, amend, add, or delete personally identifiable information on our website.
