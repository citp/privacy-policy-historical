You can set your Internet browsers to delete cookies after each session. For more details on Cookies, you should consult your Internet browser.

Please note that we do not currently respond to do-not-track signals sent by browsers. Browser settings, including do not track signals and other mechanisms, will not affect data collection and not constitute an opt-out of advertising-related cookies, personalized third-party advertising, or promotional messages from Diesel. You must use the opt-out choices described in Section IX below to opt out from such Diesel communications and third-party advertising.

## VI. Refusal to Disclose Personal Data

* * *

Providing Personal Data to DIESEL or our third-party service providers is always optional. However, some of your Personal Data, particularly your personal details, email address, postal address, credit/debit card numbers and telephone number, are necessary for pursuing the commercial purposes of the Site. Your refusal to provide DIESEL with the Personal Data needed for performing the above purposes could prevent DIESEL from processing your order of products on the Site or from fulfilling obligations required by law and other regulations. Personal Data other than that required for processing orders or fulfilling legal or contractual obligations is optional and will not have any affect on the purchase of products on the Site.

We will periodically inform you whether disclosing your Personal Data to DIESEL or its third-party service providers is necessary as indicated by the (*) symbol or optional, as well as any consequences for not disclosing such data.

We have adopted commercially reasonable security measures to protect your Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access and we encrypt credit card numbers from e-commerce transactions conducted on our Site using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. However, no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure or error free. If you have any reason to believe that your interactions with the Site are no longer secure, please notify us immediately at the address provided below.

## VIII. How Users Can Access or Change Their Personal Data
