# World Famous eBook Store | Diesel eBook Store

eGreetings and Salutations!

We’re tickled pink you clicked that “about us” link.  In fact, we’re genuinely flattered you’d want to learn more about Diesel.

Although the Diesel eBook Store exists inside your computer only, you may be interested in knowing that its people and servers can be found in beautiful Richmond, the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Let’s see.  What else?  

Ah yes, led by Scott Redford and Kelley Allen – two long-time veterans of the eBook business – Diesel is bullish about digital content.  It truly fascinates us.  As if you couldn’t already tell, right?  

Which is why we’ve worked real hard to give you instant access to over 3 million titles from hundreds of publishers including Harlequin, HarperCollins, John Wiley & Sons, McGraw-Hill, Simon & Schuster and Random House. 

But that wasn’t enough for us.  We had to make all those eBooks easy for you to find, too.  So, we developed our very own, proprietary Diesel technology.  It lets us organize our massive inventory into more than 40 categories and 2,700 subcategories.  You’ll be hard-pressed to find a more intuitive way to break your eBook search down, anywhere.  

Oh yeah…and we’re still growing.  Plans are currently underway for thousands of titles to be added each month.  Stay tuned for that!

Finally, you may be surprised to hear that we don’t view eBooks as our core business.  Yes, we sell them by the boatload.  That’s the product.  Our real business, however, is to provide a fun, positive, engaging customer experience.  That’s what we strive for.  That’s what we hopefully deliver.  

If we fall short, we trust that you’ll let us know.  Don’t be shy.  Our inbox is always open.

So, that’s pretty much it.  

This is us.  And we’re all about you.

### How do I keep track of my rewards?

You don't have to. When you log into your account, you will see the amount you have received.

### How do I redeem my reward money?

When you make any purchase, you will be given the option to apply your rewards.
