### Information We Collect

  * When the "view mode" for annotation is disabled, or when you are not logged in the Diigo service, the Diigo Toolbar does not send any information about the web pages you visit. Otherwise, the Diigo toolbar sends the URL of the page you visit to our servers for the sole purpose of looking up annotations on that page. Such information is not recorded on our servers.

  * When you bookmark, annotate or forward a page, the URL and the associated annotations you submit will be saved on our servers.

  * The Diigo Toolbar contacts our servers periodically in order to obtain automatic updates to the latest customizing information and options, and automatic updates to the latest version.

  * Diigo collects personal information when you register for a Diigo service or otherwise voluntarily provide such information.

  * Diigo uses cookies and other technologies to enhance your online experience and to learn about how you use Diigo services in order to improve the quality of our services.

  * Diigo's servers automatically record information when you visit our website or use some of our products, including the URL, IP address, browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.




### Uses

  * We may use personal information to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized content and advertising.

  * If personal information is used in any way other than indicated above, it will be in the aggregated form, and with all personal identifications removed.

### Security

Diigo member accounts are secured by member-created passwords. Diigo takes precautions to insure that member account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time.

If we make changes, we will post them on our site to make users aware of what the changes are so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. A User is bound by any minor changes to the policy when she or he uses the site after those changes have been posted If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.
