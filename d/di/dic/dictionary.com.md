The following discloses our privacy policy for this web site: Dictionary.com. We take your privacy concerns seriously and we strive to earn and keep your trust. Please do not hesitate to contact us with your questions and concerns (contact information is provided below).

We do not share your personal information, including your e-mail address, with other parties. We hate spam as much as you do, so we won't give your information to anyone.

We do not send unsolicited e-mail. If you are receiving e-mail from us, it is because at some point you, or someone with access to your e-mail account, requested it. You can always opt out of any e-mail we send you simply by following the instructions that appear at the bottom of the e-mail message in question. If you are receiving e-mail from us in response to an inquiry you made, you can rest assured that we will use your e-mail address for no purpose other than to respond to your inquiry.

Each time you visit our site, we collect the limited information that your browser makes available whenever you visit any website.

We use your [IP address](https://web.archive.org/search?q=IP%20address) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information.

Some elements on the sites such as the sponsored links advertising on our pages, are supplied to us by third parties under contract.
