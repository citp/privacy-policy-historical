**Credit Card Information** : We use your credit card information only to process your purchases and to detect and prevent fraud. 

We share user information with other companies for various reasons. What information we make available to other companies depends on the nature of our relationships with them. We generally require these other companies to keep our users' information confidential. 

**Service Providers** : We may share all of the types of information we collect with vendors who provide services (such as voice transcription, email and SMS messaging, and payment processing), conduct surveys, and run sweepstakes on our behalf.

**Advertisers** : Advertisers and advertising networks use tracking technologies to collect information about users' computers or mobile devices and their online activities (for example, web pages visited and searches made) as well as general geographic location and use that information to display targeted ads to users. We sometimes allow these ad companies to collect such information when you use our sites and apps to enable them to display targeted ads to you.

**Analytics Companies** : We allow analytics companies to use tracking technologies to collect information about our users' computers or mobile devices and their online activities. These companies analyze this information to help us understand how our sites and apps are being used. Certain versions of our App have an "Opt out of Tracking" setting, which permits you to opt out of being tracked by third party analytics companies.

**What we don't share** : We do not provide ad companies or analytics companies with your name, address, email address, phone number, or credit card information.

**Aggregated Information** : We may publicly disclose aggregated information about our users, such as the total number of our users and their overall demographics.

We may also transfer your information to another company in connection with a corporate restructuring, such as a sale or merger.

We, as well as other companies, use tracking technologies to collect and store data about your computer or mobile device and your activities on our sites and apps.

**Cookies** : When you visit our sites, we place "cookies" (small text files) on your computer to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our sites. Our cookies expire after two years. Ad companies place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display targeted ads. Some ad companies and game developers use "flash cookies" for ads and games that use Flash media technology.

Many ad companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative. NAI members allow users to opt out of being tracked by cookies. To opt out of cookie tracking by NAI members, you may visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/> and click on the "Consumer Opt-out" button. To learn how to remove cookies, you may visit these links: [deleting cookies](http://answers.ask.com/Computers/Networking_and_Security/how_to_delete_cookies_from_computer) and [deleting flash cookies](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/).

**Pixel tags** : : We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed). We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services. Ad companies use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).

**Mobile Device IDs** : If you're using an app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our apps. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted. Ad companies use device IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage. 

If you download the Dictionary.com Toolbar, we will send non-personal information about your use of the Toolbar to Ask.com, which powers the Toolbar's web search features. For more information, please see our Toolbar license agreement, <http://dictionary.reference.com/help/eula.html>. If you install one of our apps on your mobile device, your use of the app is subject to our app license agreement,[ http://dictionary.reference.com/help/dictionaryappeula.html](http://dictionary.reference.com/help/dictionaryappeula.html).

We do not allow children under 13 to register for any service, and we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13.
