#####  Security Statement  
  
  
| 

Dick Blick's checkout process is protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the standard for encrypted commercial transactions throughout the Internet. Shop safely on-line for art supplies with Dick Blick! SSL encrypts all personal information, including your name and credit card number, so that this information cannot be read as it travels through the Internet.   
  
---  
  
We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at our online store. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

Dick Blick uses VeriSign, the industry leader, as it's security verification service. Transaction information is encrypted prior to transmission using the most powerful and secure encryption technology. In addition, our site ownership, operation, and identity is verified as authentic and valid. Click on the VeriSign Secured icon at the bottom of every page to verify and view Dick Blick's security certificate.

Only those web pages where you actually enter your credit card and billing information pass encrypted information. When you request one of these checkout screens, the page's URL begins with `https` instead of `http`, and the "security" icon on your browser has the appearance of a closed padlock.   
  
#####  Privacy Statement  
  
  
| 

Dick Blick does not collect or maintain any information about how you as an individual use our website. We analyze our web log statistics as a whole, but we do not track your browsing as an individual, and we do not share or offer this information to other companies.   
  
---  
  
Dick Blick, like all companies that sell through a catalog or through an online store, maintains a list of current and potential customers. If you order from us, or if you request a catalog, then we will send you a new catalog from time to time, depending on the amount of business you do with us. We like to have email as well as postal addresses if possible. It's our best way of staying in touch.   
  
We recognize that you may or may not want to receive future catalogs and offers. If you don't want either catalogs or email from us, let us know and we will follow your wishes. If you're an on-line customer, you can tell us your wishes on this website, by clicking on "My Account" (located on every page of our site, in the upper right corner) and clicking on the link to "Update your Account Preferences".   
  
Like other companies in our industry, we sometimes rent or exchange names and mailing addresses with companies that offer catalogs in related fields. If you do not wish to receive other catalogs, please call 1-800-828-4548 or email us at [info@dickblick.com](mailto:info@dickblick.com).   
  
We do not rent or exchange email addresses or telephone numbers, and we have no plans to do so in the future. We maintain that information in our own records only so that we can contact you.   
  
We do no "direct telemarketing" by telephone or fax, and we will never offer your name and phone number to any company that does. We occasionally call our customers to ask them how our service is. For example, we sometimes monitor the shippers we use to make sure that orders are delivered in a timely manner, and without damages. However, we do no telephone marketing and we do not sell information to companies that do.   
  
If you are on online customer and you have created an account on this website, you can notify us automatically through the Internet, by clicking on "My Account" (located on every page of our site, in the upper right corner) and clicking on the link to "Update your Account Preferences". If you have never been our customer, but you request a catalog, we offer you the same options on our Catalog Request page.   
  
In the event DickBlick.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired or merged with another company, all of the customer information that we have collected may be transferred to the new company.   
  
#####  What if I don't want e-mail or catalogs?

At Dick Blick, we give you the option to change your privacy settings once you have logged into our website. While logged in, click on "My Account" (located on every page of our site, in the upper right corner), then click on the link to "Update your Account Preferences".   
  
---  
  
On the "Your Account Preferences" page, you will find a series of checkboxes. Use these checkboxes to tell us whether you are interested in receiving email promotions from us, mailings from us, or mailings from other companies that may be interested in contacting you.   
  
If you've never ordered online, but you are already a customer of ours, please feel free to write us and let us know your wishes. Write to us at [info@dickblick.com](mailto:info@dickblick.com), or send us an ordinary letter. It helps to include your customer number (available on any recent invoice, or on the address label of a recent catalog) so that we can match your request with information in our records. Although we try hard to avoid it, we sometimes end up with duplicate records for a customer.   
  
If you have asked us not to send catalogs, but you still receive one, you may be on other mailing lists. We periodically rent and exchange names with a few other companies that offer similar products and services. We try hard not to send anybody a catalog unnecessarily, and we seek your help in avoiding duplicate accounts and unnecessary mailings.   
  
If you are interested in avoiding catalog mailings in general, the Direct Marketing Association and the United States Postal Service maintain a list of consumers who do not want to receive unsolicited catalogs. If you put your name on the DMA list and keep your mailing information on that list up to date, we will not rent your name or mail you a catalog unless you request it.   
  
We try hard not to mail unnecessarily to current and prospective customers who do not want to receive catalogs. Unsolicited and unwanted catalogs are very costly to us. We really appreciate your help in avoiding unwanted mailings.
