# Privacy Policy

## Respecting your privacy

Dick Smith Electronics Pty Limited (ACN 000 908 716) and all its subsidiaries understand the importance of protecting your right to privacy of your personal information. We have policies and appropriate procedures in place to ensure that all personal information, no matter how or where it is obtained, is handled sensitively, securely, and as required by the law. We are committed to adhering to the Australian Privacy Principles (APP), which set clear standards for the collection, access, storage and use of personal information, which may be obtained as part of our business operations.

  


## What personal information do we collect and store?

When used in this policy, “personal information” has the meaning as outlined in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). Personal information generally includes any information that can be used to personally identify you in order to provide goods and services to you.

  * name;
  * residential or business address including post codes;
  * telephone number;
  * email address;
  * age and date of birth;
  * gender;
  * proof of identity, such as drivers licence or passport;
  * signature;

## Other Information

When you buy post-paid, pre-paid mobile phones and SIM cards from us, you will need to provide us with your name, residential or business address, email address and telephone number. In addition to this, we will ask you to give or show us additional information, including proof of identity details such as a Credit Card, Debit Card, Medicare Card, Drivers Licence, or Passport, the mobile phone’s International Mobile Station Equipment Identifier (IMEI) number and SIM card details.   
If you choose not to provide us with the information, we will not be able to provide pre-paid or post-paid mobile servicers our services, such as selling post-paid plans with mobile handsets, or SIM cards to you.   
You can purchase mobile phones outright without providing your personal information, however, we will still collect the mobile phone’s IMEI number during the sale.
