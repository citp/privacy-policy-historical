Dillard's understands that online and mobile privacy is very important to you. We have adopted this Privacy Policy as part of our commitment to your privacy. The terms "we", "us", and "our" refer to Dillard's Inc. and its affiliated companies. 

This Privacy Policy applies to information we obtain via Dillards.com (referred to hereafter as the Site). Please note that the Privacy Policy applies only to your interactions with us through the Site. It does not apply to interactions through our retail stores, or to your use of a Dillard's Card. A separate Privacy Notice, administered by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., pertains to your Dillard's Credit Card and Dillard's American Express® Card. For that Privacy Notice, [click here](https://retailservices.wellsfargo.com/pdf/dillards/privacy.pdf). When you use your Dillard's Credit Card or Dillard's American Express® Card on the Site, this Privacy Notice fully applies to your usage of the Site. Additionally, when using the Site you may submit product reviews. We currently use a company called PowerReviews for product reviews. Your submission of reviews is governed by a separate privacy policy maintained by PowerReviews. A link to that policy is provided on the screen from which you submit your review, but you can also review it [here](http://www.powerreviews.com/legal/privacy_policy_en_US.html). Also, if you click the [Dillard's Careers](http://careers.dillards.com/) link on the bottom of any Dillards.com page to search for Dillard's jobs, you will be directed to job listings on the Dillard's Career web site (careers.dillards.com).

3\. How We Share Information We Obtain

We may disclose the information we obtain with service providers that perform marketing, promotional and other services for us.

We also share information with other companies which provide us with services we use to conduct our business operations, including product recommendations and fraud prevention. We may also share information when we believe that it is required by law or necessary to operate our business (e.g., to our attorneys, auditors, or accountants), to protect your rights, to protect our rights, or to protect the rights of others. We may also disclose the information we obtain to any company which may in the future acquire Dillard's or a portion of its business.
