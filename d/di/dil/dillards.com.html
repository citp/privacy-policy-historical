<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">Thank you for visiting Dillards.com.  
Dillard’s understands that on-line privacy is very important to you.  We have adopted 
this Internet Privacy Policy as part of our commitment to your privacy.  The terms “we,” “us,”

 Personal Information, and explains your options regarding our use and disclosure of Personal 
 Information.  Please note that the Internet Privacy Policy applies only to your interactions

<h3><a name="WhatPersonal"></a>1. What Personal Information We Obtain.</h3>
<div align="RIGHT">
	<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
</div> 

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">      
We obtain Personal Information from you -- such as your name, address, account number, shopping
history, e-mail address and telephone number-- when you give us that information when shopping
or using our services.  For example, we may obtain Personal Information about you when you (i)
register to use our website; (ii) place an order with us; (iii) participate in our gift 
registry programs; (iv) participate in advertising promotions or sweepstakes; or (v) subscribe
to Dillards.com E-mail Updates (our e-mail newsletter).  We also may collect Personal 
Information when you correspond or speak with us. We may also collect Personal Information
about you from third parties, such as demographic or marketing firms, to improve our 
marketing efforts.   
</p>

<h3><a name="HowPersonal"></a>2. How We Use Personal Information.</h3>
<div align="RIGHT">
	<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
</div> 

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">      
We use Personal Information to conduct our business and to provide you with high quality 
products and services. For example, if you order from the Web Site, we may send you emails
and notices about your order and about other merchandise and services that we think may be 
of interest to you. We may also share Personal Information with other members of the Dillard’s 
corporate family. We do not sell or rent the Personal Information we obtain through the Web Site. 
If you want to opt out of getting promotional materials from Dillard’s, see how to change your 
preferences, below. 
</p>

<h3><a name="SharePersonal"></a>3. How We Share Personal Information</h3>
<div align="RIGHT">
	<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
</div> 
      
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">
To provide you with quality service, we may disclose the Personal Information we collect with 
service providers that perform marketing, promotional and other services for us. Service 
providers who perform services on our behalf are contractually bound to use your Personal 
Information only to help us to provide you with products and services from Dillard’s. We may 
share information about aggregate shopping histories and demographics with consultants and 
others for purposes such as analyzing retail trends and marketing. That information does not 
identify you or any other individual. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">
We may also disclose your Personal Information when we believe that it is required by law or 
necessary to operate our business (e.g., to our attorneys, auditors, or accountants), to protect 
your rights, to protect our rights, or to protect the rights of others. We may also disclose 
your Personal Information as part of our customer or contacts list if another company acquires 
Dillard’s or a portion of our business. 
</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">
Except as described, we do not share or knowingly make any Personal Information available to any 
third parties.
</p>

<h3><a name="UseCookies"></a>4. How We Use Cookies.</h3>
<div align="RIGHT">
	<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
</div> 

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">      
A "cookie" is a small data file stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive. 
It allows us to recognize your computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering 
our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information 
you have provided us. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the 
cookie.  A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus, 
or capture your email address.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">
We use cookies to keep track of when you return to the Web Site as well as to identify the 
pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the Web site you visited 
immediately before clicking to Dillards.com.  We may use this information to improve our site 
design, product assortments, customer service, and special promotions.  You can, of course, 
disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your 
browser. <em><strong>However you will not be able to make purchases on our site if you disable 
cookies.</strong></em>
</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">
If you are shopping Dillards.com and are having difficulty adding items to your shopping bag or 
completing your order, please check your privacy settings in your browser. We find that “Medium” 
Privacy Settings will optimize your online shopping experience at Dillards.com. If you are 
currently using the "Medium High" or "High" privacy settings, you can improve your online 
ordering experience if you override your current cookie handling practices for specific websites, 
including Dillards.com. Please <a href="/info/cookies.jsp">click here</a> for instructions on how to override your normal 
privacy/cookie handling practices. If you prefer not to change your privacy settings or override 
your cookie handling practices, you can, as always, place your Dillard’s order by phone at 
1-800-345-5273.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">
We may use third party companies to help us gather website traffic and other data that helps 
us to assess and improve our website and other services. These companies may use cookies, web 
beacons, or similar technology to collect and analyze information about our online traffic, on 
our behalf. These third parties are prohibited by our contracts with them from sharing that 
information with anyone other than us. However, if you would like to opt out of these third 
party services, please <a href="http://www.omniture.com/optout" target="blank">click here</a>.

<h3><a name="ChangePreferences"></a>5. How You Can Change Your Preferences or “Email Opt Out” </h3>
<div align="RIGHT">
	<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
</div> 

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">      
You may access and update your Personal Information and your preferences about receiving 
promotional information from Dillard’s or sharing your Personal Information with third party 
vendors at any time. To do that:
</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">

</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">

3.	Click “Update Personal Information”; and 
</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">
4.	Edit your personal information and click “Update Personal Information”. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">
Your new preferences will be effective after we have processed your request. Please allow up 
to 10 days for us to process your request.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify;">
If you “opt out” of receiving promotional emails from us, the only e-mails you will receive will 
be (i) about transactions that you initiate (such as to confirm orders you submit on our Web 
Site, inform you about your order status, respond to your customer service inquiries and answer 
any other questions you send us); (ii) about matters affecting your personal information; and 
(iii) in connection with certain services or promotions for which you have registered, such as 
our gift registry program.
