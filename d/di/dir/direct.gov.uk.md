# Your privacy : Directgov - Site information

This page explains our privacy policy and how we will use and protect any information about you that you give us when you visit this website.

### The Data Protection Act

Under the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.

### What information do we collect?

We collect three kinds of information from visitors to Directgov: feedback (through visitors emailing us), customer satisfaction surveys (via online pop-up surveys) and site usage information, using cookies and page tagging techniques including JavaScript.

### Feedback

We welcome your feedback.

Should you send an email to us seeking advice or information that we are not in a position to give, we may pass your email to the appropriate government department, executive agency or Non Departmental Public Body who may be able to assist you further. Some examples of external bodies that provide services on Directgov are the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and Student Finance England.

Once we have replied to you, we keep a record of your message for a maximum of two months for reference and audit purposes, after which we will delete it.

This does not collect any personal or identifiable information about users.

We sometimes tag pages on this website during promotion campaigns using pixel tags (which are sometimes called spotlight tags or web beacons). These tags enable us to find out which advertisements are successful in bringing users to our internet site(s). With this technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.

You can disable JavaScript on your computer. If you would like advice on how to disable JavaScript please contact us, giving details about the type of browser you use and we will do our best to help. Disabling JavaScript should not affect your ability to access Directgov’s internet site.
