### **How we will use your information and who we will share it with**

Direct Line insurance policies are underwritten by U K Insurance Limited (UKI). When you give us your information, it will be used and shared within the UKI owned brands. We will do that in order to provide you with the best possible products and service experience.

In carrying out the actions above we may:

to other insurers , third party underwriters, reinsurers, credit reference, fraud prevention, regulators and law enforcement agencies and other companies that provide service to us or you.

### **Where we transfer your information**

From time to time we may require services from suppliers that are based worldwide and your information will be shared with them for the purposes of providing that service. Where we engage these suppliers we make sure that they apply the same levels of protection, security and confidentiality we apply. However, such information may be accessed by law enforcement agencies and other authorities to prevent and detect crime and comply with legal obligations.

### **Dealing with other people**

It is our policy to deal with your spouse or partner who calls us on your behalf, provided they are named on the policy. Please tell us who they are when you take out your policy. If you would like someone else to deal with your policy on your behalf on a regular basis please let us know. In some exceptional cases we may also deal with other people who call on your behalf, with your consent. If at any time you would prefer us to deal only with you, please let us know.

You can do that by simply calling our customers services department or by writing to Data Protection Officer at, UKI, Churchill Court, Westmoreland Road, Bromley, BR1 1DP

From time to time we may need to change the way we use your information. Where we believe you may not reasonably expect such a change we will write to you. When we do so, you will have 60 days to object to the change but if we do not hear from you within that time you consent to that change.

### **Fraud Prevention and Anti-Money Laundering**

Please take time to read the following as it contains important information relating to the details you have given or should give to us. You should show this notice to anyone whose data has been supplied to us in connection with your policy.

To prevent and detect fraud we may at any time:

Share information with other organisations and public bodies including the police although we only do so in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998

Check and/or file details with fraud prevention agencies and databases and if we are given false or inaccurate information and we identify fraud, we will record this. We and other organisations may also use and search these agencies and databases from the UK and other countries to:

  * Help make decisions about the provision and administration of insurance, credit and related services for you and members of your household,
  * Trace debtors or beneficiaries, recover debt, prevent fraud, and to manage your accounts or insurance policies,
  * Check your identity to prevent money laundering, unless you provide us with other satisfactory proof of identity.



Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.

We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when:

  * Checking applications for, and managing credit and other facilities and recovering debt,
  * Checking insurance proposals and claims,
  * Checking details of job applicants and employees.



We, and other organisations that may access and use information recorded by fraud prevention agencies, may do so from other countries.

We can provide the names and addresses of the agencies we use if you would like a copy of your information held by them. Please contact: Data Protection Officer at, UKI, Churchill Court, Westmoreland Road, Bromley, BR1 1DP quoting your reference. The agencies may charge a fee.

### **Credit Reference Agencies**

We carry out credit searches to evaluate insurance risks.   
Depending on your credit agreement with us, if you choose to pay your premiums by instalment, we will exchange your information with credit reference agencies to reflect your credit application, both at new business and any subsequent renewals and this will be visible to other credit providers. Failure by you or anyone who pays your premium on your behalf to keep up your monthly payments will be reflected in your credit score.

### **Motor Insurance Database**

Information relating to your policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB). The MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the Police, the DVLA, the DVANI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes not limited to but including:

  * Electronic Licensing (Tax Discs),
  * Continuous Insurance Enforcement,
  * Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders),
  * The provision of government services and/or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.



If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the EEA or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.

Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.

It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. It is our responsibility to update your policy to the MID. We fully comply with the agreements in place with the MIB to update your details within seven days; however it is important that you check your policy documents ensuring that the registration number is recorded correctly.

If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your car seized by the Police. You can check that your correct registration number is shown on the MID at www.askMID.com.

If the registration number is not shown correctly on your policy documents, or you cannot find your car on the MID, please contact us immediately.
