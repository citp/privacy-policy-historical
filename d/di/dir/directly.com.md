**1.1. Directly Service.** Welcome to our website, directly.com, and related marketplace platform, and related software, technology and services (collectively the “ **Services** ”) operated by Directly Software, Inc. (“ **Directly** ,” “we,” “our,” “us”). Directly provides the Services to deliver a better customer experience for our corporate enterprise customers (“ **Customers** ”). The Services combine and improve technologies for customer experience automation with empathy and expertise from people who register and qualify as end-user experts on the Services (“ **Experts** ”). Experts are eligible to accept routed requests to perform tasks via the Services as specified by the applicable Customer, including to resolve customer service questions (“ **Answers** ”), to train technology systems for automation (“ **Training** ”), and to update knowledge databases (“ **Knowledge Base** ”, collectively “ **Expert Content** ”).

**1.2. Purpose & Scope.** Privacy and security are important to Directly. The purpose of this privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) is to inform you what information Directly processes through directly.com (including any subdomains) and the Services. The Privacy Policy details how we collect, use, and disclose different types of information or data, including personal data and your choices and rights. By “ **Personal Data** ” we mean any type of information or data that identifies, or reasonably could be used to identify, you as an individual. In some countries (for example, the European Economic Area countries or “EEA”), local legal systems have a specific definition of personal data, or in other jurisdictions, of “personally identifiable information” that will apply. Where this is the case, we refer to and will process any such data as “Personal Data.” We refer to information that does not fall under any applicable scope or definition of personal data as “ **Other Data** ” and to Personal Data and Other Data collectively as “ **Data**.” All capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our Terms. 

By accessing directly.com or submitting Personal Data through the Services, you consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or Terms, do not access or use directly.com, the Services, any other aspect of Directly’s business, and in such case, you should (a) take the necessary steps to remove cookies from your computer after leaving our website and/or Services (see Section 2.3 below), and (b) discontinue any future access or use. 

**Our Services (including directly.com) are intended for adults and not for children: Anyone under the age of 18 is not permitted to access or use directly.com or the Services.** If you are under the age of 18 you are prohibited from registering for or using a Directly Account or submitting any Data to us.

**1.3. Scope of Application.** The Privacy Policy applies to your access to and use of the Services, as either a visitor to directly.com or as an Expert. The Privacy Policy is a part of and incorporated into our Terms, which governs your use of the Services. It’s also important to note that the Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to the following:

First, the Privacy Policy **_does not_** apply to our Customers, whose license and access to the Services is governed by a separate legal agreement with Directly (each a “ **Customer Agreement** ”). Second, the Privacy Policy also doesn’t apply to a Customer’s end users who posts customer service questions independent websites, helpdesk systems, and customer service channels managed by each Customer. Third, the Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites or other digital properties, applications, services, products or software (“ **Third Party Services** ”) even if they link to or from directly.com or the Services, or any other third-party products, services or businesses such as our Customers (as described below). Accordingly, in each of these circumstances you should review the privacy practices of those independent third-parties carefully. 

**2.1. Experts and Registration for a Directly Account.** We collect Personal Data in different ways. You can visit Directly.com and certain subdomains without registering, but to become an authorized Expert eligible to respond to requests and submit Expert Content, you will need to create an account with Directly (“ **Directly Account** ”) and submit the following types of Personal Data: legal name, email address and/or mobile phone number, a personal “headshot” photo, physical mailing address, birthdate, verification phone number, and government identification (“ **Expert Registration Information** ”). Experts also have the option to create a user profile containing a description why they should be considered a “team expert,” as well as top skills and language abilities. We use elements of the Expert Registration Information to verify your identity, combat fraud and keep our Services, Experts, Customers and partners secure. By registering for a Directly account, you authorize us and/or our Third-Party Providers to verify Registration Information, including your identity.

As described in our Terms, Directly or Customers may impose additional terms and duties for your eligibility (“ **Supplemental Terms** ”). You will be given an opportunity to review and consent to such Supplemental Terms. For example, where a Customer or applicable data protection law requires special expert certification measures, and subject to your consent, Experts may be asked to provide additional Personal Data relating to professional background.

**2.2. Log and Usage Information.** We also collect other types of Data, which may be construed as Personal Data in certain jurisdictions, including the following: website usage information such as how you’ve used our Services, IP address, and other technical data such as browser type, unique device identifiers and information, language preference, referring site and the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information; approximate location data (from IP address); information regarding interactions with directly.com, such as comments, poll responses; and other information you may provide such as contact form submissions. 

**2.3. Cookies.** A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes such as site visitation. We use first party and third-party cookies for several different purposes. Some cookies are required for technical reasons to operate our Services. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Services. For example, Directly uses first party cookies to keep track of the specific directly.com webpages or Services you visit to determine which are the most popular or most used. Third parties serve third party cookies through our website for advertising, analytics and other purposes. These third parties may use information about your visits to directly.com and other websites to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. Information about cookies is available at [https://www.aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/). Many web browsers allow you to manage your preferences. You can set your browser to refuse cookies or delete certain cookies. You may be able to manage other technologies in the same way that you manage cookies using your browser’s preferences. Please note that if you choose to block cookies, doing so may impair the Services or prevent certain elements of it from functioning. On your mobile device, you may also have a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting (on iOS devices) or a setting to “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (on Android), which allows you to limit the use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving ads targeted to your interests.

**2.4. Data Collected by Third Parties.** We also acquire Data and Personal Data that certain third-party providers (each a “Third-Party Provider”) collect from you to update or supplement the Data and Personal Data you provide, or we collect automatically. If you access our Services from a Third-Party Provider in connection with services such as the Apple App Store, Google Play, Salesforce App Store, or another third-party app platform, you are subject to the privacy policies of the respective provider. Our Services and associated technology also enable one or more Third-Party Providers of analytic services (e.g., Google Analytics) to collect this type of information (such as device identifiers) so we can analyze how our Services are used. (We may also link with certain Third-Party Providers, such as Jumio, who link from our Service and collect personal data subject to its separate terms and privacy policy.) All Data and Personal Data collected by Third-Party Providers are governed by the respective provider’s terms of service and privacy policy. 

**3.1. Personal Data Use.** We and our Third Party Providers use Personal Data to: (i) provide our Services; (ii) promote, analyze and improve our Services; (iii) detect and prevent fraud, harmful or abusive conduct, or other harm to Experts, Customers, Directly and third parties.

However, where Directly is required by mandatory law to retain your Personal Data longer, or where your Personal Data is required for Directly to assert or defend against legal claims, we will retain your Personal Data until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been settled.

**5.2. Access Rights.** Individuals located in certain countries, such as the European Union or EEA, have certain statutory rights in relation to their Personal Data. Please read section 7.5 below carefully so you understand all your rights and how to exercise them. 

The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

We urge you to take steps to keep your Personal Data safe (including your account password), and to log-out of your account after use. If your Directly Account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorized access, so be careful to keep your account data secure. You use our Website and Services at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (like using a strong password). 

**7.1. Data Export and Processing.** Our Services (including directly.com) are accessible globally. We store and process Personal Data on servers located in the United States and we may transfer Personal Data (as defined under applicable law) to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have data protection laws that are different from those of the country where you reside. However, we will take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your Personal Data remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy. By using Services, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your Personal Data in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. 

**7.2. Safeguards for Exports from EEA.** If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland, we comply with applicable laws to provide an adequate level of data protection for the transfer of Personal Data. Directly is certified under the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. For more, see Directly’s Privacy Shield Policy. You agree that Directly may transfer your Personal Data to countries other than the one in which you live. We deploy the following safeguards when Directly transfers Personal Data originating from the European Union or Switzerland to other countries not deemed adequate under applicable data protection law: 

  * **E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.** To comply with European Union and Swiss data protection laws, Directly self-certified under [the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) and [the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome). These frameworks were developed to enable companies to comply with data protection requirements when transferring Personal Data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Program, please see <http://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome>.
  * **European Union Model Clauses.** Directly offers European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses, to meet the adequacy and security requirements for our Customers that operate in the European Union, and other international transfers of Personal Data. A copy of our standard data processing addendum, incorporating the Model Clauses, is [available here](https://directly.com/legal/msa/).



**7.3. Legal Basis for Processing.** If you are an individual residing in the EEA, we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the specific aspects of the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:

  * We need it to provide you with or operate the Services, including to provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services; 
  * It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for anti-fraud protection or to protect our legal rights and interests;
  * You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or
  * We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation. 



If you have consented to our use of your Personal Data for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your Personal Data because we or a third party have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services or associated services. 

**7.4. Identifying Data Controller and Data Processor and Different GDPR Roles.** Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of data. It is important to note that Directly acts as both as a Data Controller and as a Data Processor within the realm of GDPR compliance: (a) As a **Data Controller** , Directly is responsible for safeguarding the data of our registered expert users as they interact directly with our marketplace platform and our visitors to directly.com; (b) As a **Data Processor** , Directly is responsible for safeguarding the data of our Customer’s end users as it flows through our marketplace platform.

Each of Directly’s Customers is the controller of its end users’ personal data. In this context Directly serves as the processor of such personal data under instructions from each controller. Each Customer is also responsible for making sure that their respective Customer end user’s privacy rights are protected, including responding to data subject requests. Directly will respond to such data subject requests from Customers and Customer end users as a Data Processor; this means with respect to Personal Data of Customer end users, we must respond as a matter of law and contract through our Customer. On the other hand, with respect to Experts, Directly serves as the controller of Expert Personal Data and will directly respond to data subject request rights from Experts.

**7.5. Access Rights.** Individuals located in certain countries, including the European Economic Area, have certain statutory rights in relation to their personal data. Subject to any exemptions provided by law, such individuals may have the right to request access to their Personal Data, as well as to seek to update, delete or correct this information. They also have a right to restrict or object to processing and to data portability, where applicable. We may be legally required or permitted to deny or part of your request and, if we do deny your request, we will endeavor to explain the reasons underlying our decision. 

**7.6. Data Protection Authority and Representative.** Subject to applicable law, you may also have the right to (i) restrict Directly’s use of certain data elements that constitute your Personal Data and (ii) lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority or the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which is Directly’s lead supervisory authority in the European Union. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area and believe we maintain your Personal Data within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you may direct questions or complaints to our European GDPR representative. To find the data protection authority in your country, please refer to _this contact list_. Our GDPR Data Protection Representative is DPR group and can be contacted by sending an email to datainquiry@dpr.eu.com quoting “Directly Software Inc.” in the subject line. 

Because there is no accepted standard on how to respond to _Do Not Track_ signals, we respond to such signals. 

We may periodically update this Privacy Policy. If we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any) and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the website and via Services, so it is visible when you visit and/or log-on to the website or Services for the first time after the change is posted. Your continued use of the website or the Services after the changes have been posted shall constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the updated Privacy Policy, you must cease your access and use of the websites and Services.

Attention Privacy, 333 Bryant Street, #250, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. 

**How does Directly and its Services Operate?** As detailed in our Terms, Directly has entered into separate agreements with each Customer to govern the delivery, access and use of the Services including instructions for the processing of the personal data of their respective Customer end users. Each Customer licenses Directly technology and configures their help desks to enable its Customer end users to post Tasks to the Services for routing to Experts. 

**What Role does Directly serve in Data Protection?** It is important to note that Directly acts as both as a Data Controller and as a Data Processor within the realm of GDPR compliance: As a Data Controller, Directly is responsible for safeguarding the data of our Experts as they interact directly with our marketplace platform and our visitors to directly.com. As a Data Processor, Directly is responsible for safeguarding the data of our Customers Users as it flows through our marketplace platform. 

**Who is my Data Controller?** If you are a visitor to Directly.com or an Expert of the Services your Data Controller is Directly Software Inc., 333 Bryant Street, #250, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA. If you are Customer User (i.e., an individual that posted a support Request via a Customer’s website or digital property, then the Data Controller of your personal data is your respective Customer and you should direct all questions about your Personal Data to that Customer. 

**What does Directly collect and do with my Personal Data?** Directly will process your Personal Data as set out in this Privacy Policy. The Data we collect depends on how You use our website and Services. Sometimes, we receive Data directly from you, such as when you create a Directly Account to register as Expert, complete a form, or send us an email. Other times, we collect Data by recording interactions with our Website or Services. The collection and use of Data from a variety of sources is essential to our ability to provide the Services – and to help keep it trustworthy and secure. Further information about our use of your Data and Personal Data can be found in Section 2 below.

**Duration of processing of Personal Data.** Where Directly is processing and using your Personal Data as permitted by law or under your consent, we will store your Personal Data (i) only for as long as is required to fulfil the purposes set out below, (ii) until you object to Directly’s use of your Personal Data (where Directly has a legitimate interest in using your Personal Data), or (iii) until you withdraw your consent (where you consented to Directly using your Personal Data). However, where Directly is required by mandatory law to retain your Personal Data longer or where your Personal Data is required for Directly to assert or defend against legal claims, we will retain your Personal Data until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have been settled. See _Section 3.2_ , “Retention Period,” above. 

**Why am I required to provide Personal Data?** As a general principle, your granting of any consent and your provision of any Personal Data hereunder is entirely voluntary; there are generally no detrimental effects on you if you choose not to consent or to provide Personal Data. However, there are circumstances in which we cannot take action without certain Personal Data, for example, because this Personal Data is required to process your registration or provide you with access to our Services. In these cases, we cannot provide you with what you request without the relevant Personal Data. 

**Where will my Personal Data be processed?** Directly is based and operates out of the United States. As a consequence, whenever Directly is using or otherwise processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we may transfer your Personal Data to countries outside of the EEA, such as the United States, where such countries in which a statutory level of data protection applies that is not comparable to the level of data protection within the EEA. See Section 7, “European Users,” above. 

**Data subjects’ rights.** Data protection law in certain jurisdictions differentiates between the “controller” and “processor” of data. Each Customer is the controller of its Customer end user’s Personal Data and in this context Directly serves as the processor of such personal data under instructions from each controller. Each Customer is also responsible for making sure that their respective customers or end user’s privacy rights are protected, including responding to data subject requests. Directly will respond to such data subject requests from Customer end users as a processor which means that it will contact and follow the advice of the controller Customer with respect to such requests. With respect to Personal Data of Experts, Directly serves as the controller of such data and will respond to data subject request rights. _Please refer to Section 5 “Choices and Rights”_ , above, for additional information on your rights. Experts can request information about the Personal Data Directly stores about you, and the correction or deletion of such Personal Data. Please note, however, that we can delete your Personal Data only if there is no statutory obligation or prevailing right of Directly to retain it.

## Privacy Shield Principles

**1\. Notice and Choice.** Our _Privacy Policy_ describes how we use Personal Data we receive from different sources. This Privacy Shield Policy describes how we process Personal Data covered by the Privacy Shield. 

If you are a Customer, Directly may act as an agent for you in relation to the Personal Data that you provide or make available to Directly. Directly usually does not have a relationship with any users or customers of our Customers and each Customer is responsible for ensuring that their users are provided with appropriate notice and choice with respect to their Personal Data. 

**2\. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation.** We only collect Personal Data that is relevant to providing our website and associated Services. We process Personal Data in a way that is compatible with us providing the Services to you, or in other ways, for which we will provide you notification. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data received under the Privacy Shield is needed for Directly to provide its Services, and to ensure data is accurate, complete, and current. 

**3\. Accountability for Onward Transfers.** Directly may disclose Personal Data to trusted third parties as indicated in the Privacy Policy. Directly requires that its agents and service providers that have access to Personal Data within the scope of this Privacy Shield Policy provide the same level of protection as required by the Privacy Shield Principles. We ensure that our agents process Personal Data received under the Privacy Shield in a manner consistent with our obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. We may need to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, for law enforcement or national security reasons, or when such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding or court order, or when otherwise required by law. 

**4\. Data Security.** We use reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the nature of the Personal Data and the risks involved in processing that information. 

**5\. Access to Personal Data.** Our Privacy Policy explains how you may access and/or submit requests to review, correct, update, suppress, or delete Personal Data. You can ask to review and correct Personal Data that we maintain about you by sending a written request to privacy@directly.com.
