When you make a booking we may need to share your personal information with the providers (e.g. Ferry Operators, insurance providers, product distributors) of the services and products you’re purchasing. This information may also be shared with other third parties, including port authorities, customs, and passport offices, where this is necessary to fulfil the ferry service contract.

We may disclose information about you, your account and booking history to (i) companies within the Direct Ferries Group for the purposes and subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement; and (ii) in the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, in which case you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party for the purposes and subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement.
