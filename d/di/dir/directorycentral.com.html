					                                    a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
					                                    It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure
					                                    you are updated as to any changes. If SocialTerrain materially changes its practices
					                                    regarding collection or use of your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, your PERSONALLY

					                                    in SocialTerrain Services activities like sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, because

					                                    including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This data is used to

					                                    Third party advertisements displayed on SocialTerrain Services may also contain

													</p>
													<p>
					                                    When you voluntarily provide PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION to SocialTerrain,
					                                    we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how

													<p>
					                                    At the time you provide your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, SocialTerrain

					                                    SocialTerrain Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.

					                                    SocialTerrain may use cookies and similar tools to customize the content and advertising
					                                    you receive based on the Profile Information you have provided. Profile Information
					                                    you provide in structured profile fields or questions (multiple choice questions
					                                    like "Marital Status," "Education" and "Children") ("Structured Profile Information"),
					                                    information you add to open-ended profile fields and questions (essay questions

					                                    and other non-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION about you may also be used to

					                                    interests. For example, based on your music interests we might display an advertisement
					                                    to make sure you are advised when your favorite band is coming to town. The information
					                                    used for this feature does not provide your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
					                                    or identify you as an individual to third parties.
													</p>
													<p>
					                                    Some of the advertisements that appear on SocialTerrain Services may also be delivered
					                                    to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain
					                                    technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect non-PERSONALLY
					                                    IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION about your visit to or use of SocialTerrain Services, including
					                                    information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that

														Third party applications (such as widgets) created by third party developers may
					                                    also be available on the SocialTerrain Services. Third party applications are small
					                                    bits of software, often with interactivity, that can be installed into Members'
					                                    profiles or shared with other Users. However, SocialTerrain does not control the
					                                    third party developers, and cannot dictate their actions. When a Member engages
					                                    with a third party application, that Member is interacting with the third party
					                                    developer, not with SocialTerrain. SocialTerrain encourages Members not to provide
					                                    PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION to the third party's application unless the
					                                    Member knows the party with whom it is interacting.

					                                    In order to locate other SocialTerrain Members that you may already know in the
					                                    physical world, SocialTerrain allows Users to search for Members using Registration
					                                    PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (i.e., full name or email address). SocialTerrain
					                                    also allows Users to browse for certain Profile Information in order to help connect
					                                    with Members (i.e., schools and/or companies where Users may have attended or worked).
					                                    SocialTerrain may also enable Members to publicly display some Registration PERSONALLY
					                                    IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION as an element of their Profile Information if they choose
					                                    to do so via a profile setting under "Edit Profile." Search engines may index the
					                                    portion of a Member's profile (including the Profile Information it contains) that
					                                    is publicly displayed.

					                                    to provide SocialTerrain with a specific service and not for any other purpose.
					                                    SocialTerrain may also provide your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION to a third
					                                    party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain information and
					                                    have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires the sharing of
					                                    your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. SocialTerrain also may share your PERSONALLY
					                                    IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION with Affiliated Companies if it has a business reason to

					                                    companies to do so. Your non-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION and/or Profile

					                                    SocialTerrain prohibits these companies from sharing your non-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
					                                    INFORMATION and/or Profile Information with any third party or from using it for

					                                    There may be instances when SocialTerrain may access or disclose PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
					                                    INFORMATION , Profile Information or non-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION without
					                                    providing you a choice in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property
					                                    of SocialTerrain, our Affiliated Companies or their employees, agents and contractors
