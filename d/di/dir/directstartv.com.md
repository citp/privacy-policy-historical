# DIRECTV Privacy Policy

_This site is controlled and operated by DirectStarTV. Our priority is to ensure that your privacy is respected, that your transaction is secure, and that any data you provide to us is protected._

**Online Privacy**

Personal information is collected only when users voluntarily register at a DirectStarTV site to purchase items, receive newsletters, or for other special offers or promotional opportunities. It is DirectStarTV policy to maintain all personal information as confidential and to use it only for the purpose for which it was submitted. If you want to correct any personal information supplied to DirectStarTV please let us know by phone, email or mail. If you request services from this site you may receive future offers related to the communications industry. If you are already registered but no longer wish to receive messages from us, please let us know by phone, email or mail. 

**Online Security**

DirectStarTV's method of collecting information from users is secure and all information collected is protected from unauthorized access. 

**Sharing Data**

In order to process your order or request, it may be necessary to share your information with DirectStarTV affiliates. Additionally, DirectStarTV works closely with reputable businesses to provide you with quality products and services. Occasionally, these companies make special offers available to DirectStarTV customers. At any time, you may request that DirectStarTV not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties. Please contact us at comments@directstartv.com to make that request. 

**Aggregate Data**

As with all servers on the Internet, the computers that deliver the Web pages to you identify your computer by its unique IP address or that of your ISP, such as AOL. The servers automatically record the name of the domain from which you accessed the site and the type of operating system and web browser that you use. The data are collected for one-time use only and are analyzed to identify broad demographic trends. This information cannot be used to identify you personally. If you desire to prevent that information from being recorded, you can consult your computer browser for instructions to erase or block that information from being recorded. 

**Children and Privacy**

DirectStarTV encourages parents to spend time with their children online. Under no circumstances does DirectStarTV intentionally collect personal data from any person under the age of 14. If you are under 14, please ask a parent to provide any information or exit this site. Persons under 14 are not eligible to enter into the promotions or service agreements offered on this site. 

DirectStarTV reserves the right to change these terms and conditions at any time, at its sole discretion. Please revisit our privacy policy when you revisit our site.
