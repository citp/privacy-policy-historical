**3\. Hyperlinks.** Directnic may contain hyperlinks to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party sites.

We collect your financial information such as account and/or credit card numbers for the sole purpose of billing you for the Services you purchase.

 

**5\. Cookies.** We may permit an ad company to display ads on Directnic that may contain cookies.

That advertising company, and not us, has exclusive control of and access to the information it collects.

Any credit card or other sensitive information you enter is transmitted via SSL, a very strong encryption technology, which is the Internet standard for safety and security.

 

**8\. Permitted Disclosures.** We may disclose personal information about you to third parties when the disclosures have been specifically authorized by you or when we believe, in good faith, that such disclosures are reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, dispute resolution process, or to comply with or enforce this Agreement.

 

**9\. Remarketing.** We are participants in remarketing advertising. This program allows us to connect with previous customers and visitors in an effort to encourage them to purchase our services through targeted advertising. Through participation in this program, we permit third-party vendors, including Google, to display our advertising on websites across the Internet. Google uses cookies to serve our advertising on visitors to our site whenever they browse competing sites for similar services. We do permit anyone to opt-out of this program as outlined below.
