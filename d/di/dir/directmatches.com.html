<strong>How We Use Member Information</strong> <br> 
Besides using your personal information for billing purposes, we use your email address to send you member matches via email and news about the company. Other members do not have access to your personal email address, unless you provided it to them directly. Our eRewards program is a complementary online shopping program where you can earn rebates for shopping online through Directmatches.com when you register. We also use your information here to track your purchase transaction requests and fulfillment of any goods purchased online in order to send your rebates earned through eRewards. This is to ensure that your account is properly credited and to better combine services and improve content and navigation. Finally, we may use the information to send you e-mail notifications about, new site features, and to alert you to new products, services and special offers. This contact is done directly by Directmatches.com but can contain information directly about our affiliate’s special offers or promotions or other marketing material.  
<br> <br> 
If you choose to use our Tell-A-Friend feature, our member match referral service to tell a friend about another member’s profile you found on our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the member’s profile you’ve sent. Directmatches.com does not store this information and the information is for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 
<br> <br> <br> 
<strong>Who Sees Member Information </strong><br> 
A small number of Directmatches.com employees or contracted consultants or parties may have access to your personal information. We may use other services, contractors or vendors to provide some of the services for example credit card and payment processing, technical services, development or repair. If we need to disclose personal information for them to provide the services, it is with the requirement that the information is kept confidential and is used only for those services. 
<br><br>
For your protection we also use specialized third party credit card processors and payment systems in order to facilitate payments. When you enter your billing credit card details it is on a third party site and not directly on Directmatches.com even though the page may contain the Directmatches.com logo or look and feel. This is done to keep a flow to our existing pages and for technical sequence of navigation. 
<br> <br> 
Directmatches.com will disclose our Member Information in cases where, in its discretion, it deems such disclosure is required or appropriate in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
<br> <br>

You will be notified via email or we may post a notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
