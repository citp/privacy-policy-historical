	<strong>Notice to California Residents - Your California Privacy Rights (As Provided by California Civil Code section 1798.83).</strong></p>
<p>
	California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses that share customer personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to such information-sharing. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose a customer's personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. As described in our Privacy Policy, you can opt-out of our sharing of your personal information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes by emailing hello@directly.com with words “opt-out” in the subject line.
