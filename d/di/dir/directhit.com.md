Additionally, when you enter a search query using the Site or Services, we will receive the query text and process it, together with the above data, to return a search results page to you. If you have modified your browser settings so that address-bar search queries and erroneous domain name system (DNS) requests are submitted to us, we may also receive any search query or misspelled URL that you enter into your browser's address bar. 

Beginning with search queries received on or before July 1, 2009, we disassociate your query text data from your IP address and your unique cookie ID (see "How are cookies used on the Sites?" below) after a period of 18 months, except in limited circumstances, such as requests to retain the information by law enforcement.

The Site and Services usually do not require registration or submission of an account name or email address in order to use them. However, you would provide to us your email address if you submitted a help request to us via email. The amount of information that you choose to disclose to us is completely up to you.

### How may we use the information we collect?

We use the information that we collect to improve the overall quality of your experience with the Site and Services, and to facilitate evaluation, improvement, and development of the Services.

Information about the search queries you submit to the Sites and how you interact with search results may also be used to personalize the content and advertisements that we present to you. We may, based on the search queries you submit and the search results you select (including paid search results), draw inferences about your interests and display advertisements matched to such interests.

These employees have been informed of the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information. Unfortunately, no security system can be 100% secure; accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that we collect online.
