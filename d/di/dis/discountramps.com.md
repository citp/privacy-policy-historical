# Discount Ramps.com - Privacy Policy

Discount Ramps and its operational service partners collect and use your personal information to process product orders and deliver the products requested. It is possible that Discount Ramps may also use personal information to inform you of other products or services available from Discount Ramps and its affiliates. Discount Ramps may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

Discount Ramps does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.

We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Discount Ramps or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Discount Ramps abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.
