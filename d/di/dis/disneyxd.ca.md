### DisneyXD.ca PRIVACY POLICY

At DisneyXD.ca, we understand and appreciate the concerns that parents and families may have with regard to information gathered about visitors to our website, or on any other website. This Privacy Policy describes The Family Channel Inc.'s ("Disney XD", "we" or "our") privacy practices and procedures. The Disney XD website gathers certain personal information from its visitors and uses that information solely for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Personal information is information about an individual. Examples include name, age, street address, email address, phone number, birthday, pictures and voice recordings.

**COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
DisneyXD.ca is a site for kids. We take particular care in the collection of personal information from children. We do not require personal information from children to obtain access to, surf or view the contents of our website. However, we may collect personal information under the following circumstances:

• you (or your child) subscribe to a newsletter;  
• you (or your child) enter a contest or promotion;  
• you (or your child) participate in online activities;  
• you contact us to make a request or comment; or  
• you respond to questionnaires.

We will only collect the personal information from a child under the age of 16 that is reasonably necessary for the purposes providing of administering the child's participation in a promotion, contest or online activity. Parental consent will be required for children under certain ages to participate in certain activities (as more particularly described below). In such circumstances, we will collect parents' email address for those users and contact such parents to request their consent. 

We also take extra steps to prevent members from disclosing their personal info on our site by monitoring the interactive features and actively enforcing our rules. 

Any personal identifiable information collected from our members is for DisneyXD.ca purposes only (e.g. contest fulfillment, e-birthday cards, etc.). We will never sell or give any of this information to third parties, unless otherwise disclosed in this privacy policy. We may transfer personal information to Disney XD's third party service providers who agree to maintain the confidentiality of such transferred personal information and are prohibited from using such information for any other purpose. Sometimes we may share aggregated info collected from our surveys, however specific members are never identified. We will also disclose personal information if required by law or regulation. For example, we will disclose personal information in response to a search warrant or other legally valid enquiry or order, or to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law. We will obtain your consent before using or disclosing your personal information in any manner other than as described in this Privacy Policy.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR CONTESTS**   
An eligible user may enter Disney XD contests through our website DisneyXD.ca. On the online entry form, we ask for personal information such as your name, age, street address, email address and phone number. This personal information is collected, used and/or disclosed solely for the purpose of awarding contest prizes, tracking compliance with the official rules and regulations and for internal feedback purposes. Parental consent for entrants under the age of majority in their Province/Territory of residence is verified prior to delivery of prizes. Disney XD only uses and discloses a contest winner's name and photograph after receiving prior written consent from the winner (or their parent/guardian) and the appropriate release forms are fully completed by a parent/guardian and returned to Disney XD. 

Disney XD sometimes uses a third party company (Disney XD's contest fulfillment house) to draw winners names, contact winners and send prizing to you. The personal information collected by this company is solely for the purpose of the contest fulfillment, and this company is contractually obligated to maintain the private and/or confidential nature of the collected information. 

Contest entry names and information are seen only by Disney XD and Disney XD's contest fulfillment house. Such information is stored in a secure location and only accessible for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is collected, and it is destroyed, in a manner which ensures that the private and/or confidential nature of the information is preserved, typically within 60 days after those purposes have been fulfilled. 

**CONTACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE**  
If you telephone, write or email us to comment on our services or website, we will retain the information for our records during a certain period of time. Disclosure of your name and personal information is voluntary in these circumstances.  
Online Polls and Surveys 

Occasionally DisneyXD.ca visitors are invited to voluntarily answer polls or survey questions that may be used in conjunction with sponsors/business partners. Be assured that in these poll and survey situations, only non-identifiable, general information such as gender, age and postal code is collected. The information collected ensures that visitors remain anonymous. 

**GENERAL WEBSITE TRAFFIC**   
Disney XD tracks the number of visits to our site. All information gathered in this way is generic, and we do not track any individual users from this, but only calculate how many visits have taken place and how visitors navigate our site.

**COOKIE TECHNOLOGY**   
Cookie technology is used on our site to maximize the site experience. For example, we use cookies to keep track of a user's time zone information which allows us to customize our schedule and give accurate show times. We also use cookies to keep track of a user's progress through a game we may have on our site. No personal information is gathered from these cookies.

**SECURITY**   
We protect your personal information using security systems including appropriate technological, physical and organizational security procedures. Information that you provide is stored in a secure database and is only accessible by those DisneyXD.ca staff who need access to it. We screen and train our employees carefully to ensure that they will always have the highest regard for you and your privacy. 

**ONLINE SAFETY NOTES FOR KIDS**   
The web is a great place to hang out, to find out stuff, and to share comments and ideas with people who are into the same kind of stuff you are. But the net isn't always a safe place - so we've put together some tips for you to read that will help you handle situations if they come up. First thing is don't give out personal information without asking your parents. Personal information can mean: 

• YOUR NAME   
• YOUR ADDRESS   
• YOUR PHONE NUMBER   
• YOUR MOM OR DAD'S NAME   
• THE NAME OF YOUR SCHOOL   
• YOUR TEACHER OR YOUR FRIEND'S NAMES 

Secondly, if you run into something on the internet that makes you uncomfortable - whether it's on the web or it's sent to you - tell your mom or dad, or an adult you can talk to, and get them to deal with it. Never agree to meet anyone you have "met" online. 

Never send your picture over the internet without checking with your parents or another adult. Don't answer mean messages, or rude ones, or messages asking for personal information. If you do get a message like that - tell your parents right away, so they can help you deal with it. Make sure you obey the rules that your parents have set out for you. Make up a cool nickname for when you join a chat or a game online. Never tell anyone your real name or your password. Get your parents to read the safety for parent's tips. 

**ONLINE SAFETY NOTES FOR PARENTS**   
The web is a great place for kids to hang out and learn about topics that are of interest to them. However, there are areas on the internet that are not appropriate for children.  
The guidelines we have drawn up are a starting point for parents of children who surf. The most important thing is to be aware of what your children are doing online. This may mean surfing with your children, or talking to them about the Sites that they like or that they have recently discovered on the web. 

Make surfing a Disney XD activity, particularly with young children. Set ground rules, so each person knows what is expected of them. For example, you could go through the safety tips together so everyone understands the whats and the whys. 

There are software programs that allow parents to block certain websites from their kids. Some programs are more flexible than others, so you may want to shop around to find one that you're comfortable with. 

**OTHER SITES**   
Please keep in mind that this Privacy Policy applies to DisneyXD.ca only. Occasionally, we may have links to other sites, including those of sponsors and partners. And although we do our best to ensure that these third parties share our views about privacy protection and safety, we don't have control over how they collect and use personal information from visitors. Therefore, we are not responsible or liable for any personal information you provide such third parties. It's always a good idea to check out a site's privacy policy - even if you've linked to it from DisneyXD.ca.

**ACCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**   
You have the right to access, verify and amend personal information that we collect about you. To keep your personal information current, you can amend inaccuracies and make corrections by contacting us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy.

We review this Privacy Policy regularly and will update it (and other sections of our website) whenever necessary. If there are ever changes made to the way we collect or use personal information, we will always inform our members.
