# Privacy Policy & Terms of Use | Discover Los Angeles

Welcome to the website of Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board and your source for information about Los Angeles.

The following privacy policy and terms of use outlines the types of information we gather when you visit our website(s), and steps we take to safeguard it.

**Information Collection**  
We collect information in several ways from different parts of our website(s).  We do not collect personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us.  We collect limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available automatically whenever you visit a website. This information includes the internet address of your computer or network, the date, time, and page you visited on our site, your browser and operating system, and the referring page (the last webpage you visited before clicking on a link to our site).

We use the aggregated information from all of our visitors to measure server performance, analyze user traffic patterns and improve the content of our site.  We sometimes track the keywords that are entered into our search engine to measure interest in specific topics, but we do not track which terms a particular user enters.

If you, agree, we will be using your e-mail address to provide you with information we think you will be interested in, for example, to send you our newsletters, notify you of new publications, or inform you about updates to our website. You can let us know at any time if you would prefer not to receive any or all of this information either directly on our website or by sending an e-mail to [website@latourism.org](mailto:website@latourism.org).

**Online Services and RFP Forms**  
Some of the online services available with our website(s) require you to register for an account or provide personal information.  You will be asked for applicable information to create an account, including name, email address and a preferred password for your account.  We do not give, share, sell, rent or transfer any personal information to a third party, unless we have your consent.

If you would like us to delete all of your personal information (except for information that we keep for record-keeping purposes) and/or remove your name and address from promotional lists (including any personal information gathered by our service providers) and place your name on our “do not contact” list, you should contact our Privacy Administrator at [website@latourism.org](mailto:website@latourism.org). Please note that any requests to update your personal information may take up to 30 days for an email request and six weeks to process a postal-mail request.

**Cookies**  
To help us serve you better, we collect information that does not identify you personally, but rather identifies your computer or browser. Cookies are pieces of information placed in the settings of your web browser by a website server to identify your computer when you return to a website. Whenever a site welcomes you and tailors data to your specifications, it is reading a cookie left in your browser and identifying information that you may have registered during previous visits, such as your viewing preferences.

Cookies are not used to track any personal information. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites and most Internet web browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by user intervention, or to delete cookies. However, some features may not function properly without cookies.

**Links**  
The website may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites and those other sites have not agreed to our privacy policy. Visit those sites for information regarding their privacy policy prior to providing personal information.

The links we provide on our website(s) are there for your reference and convenience. We do not control any of these websites, nor are we responsible for their content. We do not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators by including these links. If you decide to access any of these Websites you do so entirely at your own risk .

**Site Security**  
We take appropriate security measures to protect unauthorized access, alteration or destruction of data on our website(s). We exercise reasonable care to protect your non-public personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your non-public personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.

**Correspondence**  
We maintain and review e-mail correspondence that you send to us. We may use (and maintain in a file specific to you) the personally identifiable information disclosed in the e-mail. Because such correspondence contains information that is not transmitted through the operation of the Site, it is not subject to the terms of this Policy.

**Policy Changes**  
We reserve the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove any portion of this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time. Modification of changes in the Agreement will be posted on the website. By using this website you agree to be bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit the page to determine the then current terms of use to which you are bound.

**Consent**  
By using a Site, you consent to the collection and use of information by us as set forth in this Policy.
