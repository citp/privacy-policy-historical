If you choose to place an order with us, the cookie will be removed when your order is placed. Otherwise, it will expire 24 hours after your initial visit to our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback is that you may not be able to place more than one item in your shopping cart.

If we become aware of a situation where we have collected personally identifiable information from a person under 13 years of age without parental consent we will remove the information from our records. 


**Information Sharing**

We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and/or advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We use a credit card processing company to bill users for purchases. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purpose.

Occasionally we may provide our mailing list to partners that we feel our users would like to receive information from. The information provided will only include your name and mailing address, it will **NOT** include your telephone number, credit card information, e-mail address, ordering information/habits or any other personally identifiable information.

If you decide to accept the offeri; the credit card you used to make your purchase will be transmitted via secure means to Affinion Corporation for the purposes of purchasing their offer. If you do not accept the offer on the sign-up screen your credit card information WILL NOT be transmitted.

**Link Issues**

This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Discount Dance Supply, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

**Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as those that encompass our order process, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer) becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are "just surfing."

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, customer service representatives and order processing employees) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a securely locked environment.

If you have any questions about security at our web site, you can write to info@discountdance.com.

**Additional Uses & Choice/Opt-out**

Telephone Solicitations Users will never be solicited by telephone for any product offer. They may be contacted by phone if there is a problem or question about an order that they have placed. Also, from time to time, we may phone a small percentage of our customers in order to conduct quality assurance surveys. These surveys are optional and take place only on rare occasions. 

**Email Solicitations**

From time to time we may offer additional email communications (such as a newsletter, special offers, site update notifications, etc); customers may choose not to be included in these e-mail messages by using the customer service section as well as following the instructions included in the e-mail itself. 

**Choice/Opt-out**

Customers will always be provided with an opportunity to opt out of any mailings or telephone calls not directly related to order fulfillment. If you are an existing customer and wish to opt out of any mailings please see our customer service section. 

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, notification will be linked from our homepage to the new policy so that our users are always up-to-date on what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances (if any) we disclose it. Users will be notified via email and presented with an opportunity to opt-out should we decide to use information in a manner that is inconsistent with the way in which it was collected
