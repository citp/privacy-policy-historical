We specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of such DiscountPandit Merchant.

However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</p><p>We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.</p><p>We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners, Affiliates and Advertisers.

If you are already logged into DiscountPandit but not logged into Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to "Sign up for Facebook." By proceeding you are allowing the DiscountPandit site to access your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use in your use of DiscountPandit sites.</p><p>Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a DiscountPandit user and you click on "Sign in Using Facebook," you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join DiscountPandit.
