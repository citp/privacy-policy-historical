 **Browsing**

This website does not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. This means that we will not know your name, your email address or any other personally identifiable information just because you browse the website, unless you have created an account and log-in when you access the website or access the website from a link in an email that we sent to you.

 **Information We Collect and How We Use It:**

When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need.

 **General Information Collected**

To monitor website usage and improve the quality of our website, we gather general information about the use of our website. We use web server logs and industry-standard website statistics software to count the number of users who visit our website and to count the number of views of particular pages, as well as to track other general statistics about our website. We do not track individual users' visits to our website. At times, Brand USA may share with third parties the aggregate, anonymous information about overall usage of our website and other Internet services that we collect, in order to provide general information about our Internet services, sell advertising or establish sponsorships or other business relationships. We do not share any information about specific users.

 **Information Collected from Surveys**

We may conduct online surveys via pop-up windows on our website. Participation in such surveys is voluntary and you may decline to participate. In general, the data collected in such surveys will be used by Brand USA and not shared with any third parties.

 **Information Collected to Process a Transaction**

The website may have a section that allows certain visitors, marketing partners or other pre-approved industry organisations to upload and edit information to the website, including but not limited to certain marketing promotions, services or products that they are working on collaboratively with Brand USA (a ‘Transaction’). In order to conduct a transaction on the website, visitors or others must log in. You will need to create an account to generate a unique user name and password. Information collected may include your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address and other pertinent information. The personal information you provide will be encrypted and sent to us using a secure method, in order to assure that your personal information is securely and safely transmitted. However, please understand that no one can give an absolute assurance that information intended to be maintained as private, whether transmitted via the Internet or otherwise, cannot be accessed inappropriately or unlawfully by third parties. We have taken and will continue to take reasonable steps to ensure the secure and safe transmission of your personal information.

 **Emails/Newsletters**

It is our intention to only send you email communications that you want to receive. When you provide us with your email address by creating an account, we will periodically contact you via email about Brand USA, its programmes and services. Every time you receive an email, you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future emails by following the instructions provided in the email. You may also opt-out by emailing [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or sending a letter to:

Please note that Brand USA will never send you an email requesting your password, credit card number, social security number or other similar personal or private identification information (‘Personal Information’). If you receive an email that looks like it is from Brand USA, but asks you for Personal Information, it is a fraudulent email and you should not reply or provide such information.

 **Securing the Storage of Information**

We treat the Personal Information you provide to us as confidential information. After Personal Information reaches Brand USA, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorised access.

 **Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

Brand USA uses the services of third parties, such as interactive marketing agencies, market researchers and email service providers to assist us with marketing and promoting the website. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Brand USA specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We do not permit the sale of Personal Information.

 **Cookies and Pixel Tags**

Our website uses ‘Cookie’ technology. ‘Cookies’ are encrypted strings of text that a website stores on a user's computer. Our website requires the use of a ‘Session’ Cookie when accessing the online traveller community. ‘Session’ Cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once you close your Internet browser. Session Cookies allow you to log-in and then view and update your content throughout the website during the same session or visit to our Site. Our website uses a ‘Persistent’ Cookie to direct you to the correct country/language version of our Site for subsequent visits to the website. Persistent Cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or are otherwise removed upon expiration. We do not use Cookies to ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us. Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer, programs or computer files.

Pixel tags are not visible to the user of the website and consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tags are not used to collect any personally identifiable information about you. Our website uses pixel tags to track the aggregate number of page views made on our Site by all Site visitors. Our email service provider uses pixel tags to determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages. This capability helps our service provider send email in a format you can read. The sensor does not collect or use any other information. Pixel tags also allow us to know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us.

Our website uses third-party advertising technology to display ads and track the aggregate number of times each ad is displayed. Our third-party advertising technology does not use pixel tags or cookies, nor does it collect any personally identifiable information about you.

Brand USA will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful activities to Brand USA, its associates or property (including this website), or to others.
