For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, that are located in external controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through <a href="https://seal.verisign.com/splash?form_file=fdf/splash.fdf&amp;dn=CHECKOUT.NETSUITE.COM&amp;lang=en&amp;KeepThis=true&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;height=400&amp;width=600">VeriSign's Payment Service.</a><br><a href="https://seal.verisign.com/splash?form_file=fdf/splash.fdf&amp;dn=CHECKOUT.NETSUITE.COM&amp;lang=en&amp;KeepThis=true&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;height=400&amp;width=600"><img src="http://www.discountramps.com/images/secure-shopping.jpg" border="0" alt="Secured Shopping with VeriSign"></a></p>

	Discount Ramps.Com LLC also utilizes a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent through the Internet. The digital certificate and seal that you see on our checkout system is from Verisign, Inc., a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of Discount Ramps.Com LLC and it's Affiliates (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small popup window displaying site security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form.
	Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password you created when you signed up for an account at Discount Ramps.Com LLC or it's Affiliates (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. No Customer Service Associate or any other representative of Discount Ramps.Com LLC will ever ask you for your password.
	The confidentiality of your password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by going to "<a href="http://shopping.netsuite.com/app/site/query/checkoutredirect.nl?c=578694&amp;ext=T&amp;login=T" rel="nofollow">My Account</a>".
