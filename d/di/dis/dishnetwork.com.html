				<h3>Welcome to the DISH Network Privacy Policy page.</h3>
	
				<p>
				<b><em>DISH Network Consumer Privacy Policy</em></b><br>
				This policy covers all Consumer DISH Network Web sites and DISH Network Interactive Television services.<br><br>
			
				<b>General Policy:</b><br>
				DISH Network's overall policy is to allow the consumer to "opt-out" and not be contacted with offers by DISH Network and/or partner organizations. If a consumer does not opt-out, DISH Network will collect and use customer and prospective customer information for a variety of purposes including market research and direct marketing, both by DISH Network and partner organizations.<br><br>
	
				This policy covers information collected by DISH Network on any of its Web sites and through transactions on DISH Network Interactive Television services.<br><br>

				If you opt-out, no information about you will be sold or released to anyone without prior consent or a court order. Otherwise, information may be used as deemed necessary by DISH Network.<br><br>

				When first logging into the DISH Network Customer Support Center, or when purchasing a system online, you will be asked to respond to questions similar to the following:<br><br>

				<b>· Is it okay to contact your e-mail with news from DISH Network?</b><br>
				<b>· Is it okay to contact your e-mail with news from DISH Network partners?</b><br><br>

				These questions are pre-selected to indicate that it is okay for DISH Network to contact you as indicated. If you do not wish to be contacted, please de-select them and continue.<br><br>
 
				If you indicate that it is okay to be contacted with news from DISH Network, DISH Network will use your e-mail address to send you information about important upcoming events and opportunities. You can cancel this service at any time by logging into the Customer Support Center, selecting My Account, and de-selecting the box to receive news and offers via e-mail.<br><br>

				If you indicate that it is okay to contact you with news from DISH Network Partners, DISH Network may share your contact information with partner organizations that may e-mail you information concerning their products and services. You can cancel this service at any time by logging into the Customer Support Center, selecting My Account, and de-selecting the box to receive news and offers via e-mail.<br><br>

				Even if you opt-out of the e-mail contact options above and you are currently a subscriber to DISH Network services, DISH Network may contact you via telephone, mail, and/or e-mail from time to time regarding issues with your account. DISH Network and/or partner organizations may also contact you by telephone or mail regarding DISH Network promotions, products and/or services, as well as promotions and products and/or services of partner organizations.<br><br>

				If you are a subscriber to DISH Network Interactive Television services, DISH Network may capture information you provide through interactive television transactions and track your use of interactive television services. Additionally, DISH Network and/or partner organizations may present you with interactive television advertisements based on information you have provided DISH Network or partner organizations.<br><br>

				You have the right to instruct DISH Network not to share your contact information with other organizations by notifying DISH Network in writing. The written notices described above should include your name, current address, Social Security Number, telephone number, account number, and type of account (e.g. Residential). You must send such notices to:<br><br>

				<b>DISH Network<br>
				5701 S. Santa Fe Drive<br>
				Littleton, CO. 80120<br>
				Attention: PRIVACY <br><br></b>

				<b>Information We Collect from You:</b><br>
				When you become a DISH Network subscriber, register with one of our interactive services (Internet or interactive television), browse our Web sites, communicate with us via telephone, fill out product registration cards, participate in market research projects, or otherwise transact with DISH Network, we will collect personal data from you. This information may include but is not limited to, name, address, phone number, e-mail address, IP address, credit card information, demographic information, and personal interests.<br><br>

				DISH Network may combine information we have on you as a customer from multiple sources, both online and offline. This includes information available from external sources.<br><br>

				<b>Security of Information:</b><br>
				All customer information is maintained in secure databases.<br><br>

				<b>Credit Card Transactions:</b><br>
				Credit card transactions are processed using a secure, encrypted Web server. Unauthorized parties cannot read your credit card information as it travels through our ordering system.<br><br>

				Credit card information collected during transactions is maintained in a secure database at DISH Network for fraud prevention and accounting and billing purposes. The information is also securely maintained by CSG Systems, Inc. for accounting and billing purposes. Your credit card information is not available to unauthorized parties while in these databases.<br><br>

				Stored information from credit card transactions is not released to third party marketers under any circumstances. Stored information from credit card transactions is not released to anyone unless under court order as part of a criminal investigation.<br><br>

				<b>Minors:</b><br>
				DISH Network does not knowingly attempt to collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Note that DISH Network cannot always determine that a user is a child.<br><br>

				<b>Databases:</b><br>
				DISH Network does maintain databases of current customers and people who have shown an interest in DISH Network products and/or services. These are for account maintenance, market research, and promotional use only. This information may be released to third-party marketers and partner organizations for market research and promotional use unless the individual in question instructed DISH Network not to do so by contacting DISH Network in writing at the address found above. This information is not released under any other circumstance except by court order.<br><br>

				DISH Network maintains a database of users who log onto the DISH Network Customer Support Center in order to track information concerning the type of customer (current or potential), customer name, and log on information. This information is used for security purposes to identify customers who purchase equipment from DISH Network online, or conduct other customer service transactions online.<br><br>

				<b>Cookies:</b><br>
				Internet 'cookies' may be used to customize DISH Network Web sites to the viewer. These cookies remain on the user's system and are automatically retrieved when a user visits at a later time. These cookies contain only information concerning the type of customer (current or potential) and frequently visited pages. No other personal information is stored on cookies.<br><br>

				Cookies may also be placed on the user's system by an Internet advertising network in order to track the viewing of banner ads displayed on DISH Network Web sites.<br><br>

				Since it is not necessary for a person to identify him or herself, cookies cannot be associated with an individual who selects not to log in or identify him or herself in any other way.<br><br>

				Customers who are still uncomfortable with the use of cookies have the option of disabling them on their browser. DISH Network in no way discriminates against Web site visitors who have disabled cookies on their browser.<br><br>

				<b>Interactive Television:</b><br>
				DISH Network can identify you based on your receiver. We may use this ability combined with your account information and other information we have collected to display interactive television advertisements on your television.<br><br>

				Currently, customers cannot opt-out of this service.<br><br>

				<b>Other Stored Information:</b><br>
				Aggregate reports for Web site visitors are also generated to measure the performance of DISH Network Web sites. These reports do not contain any personally identifiable information.<br><br>

				When an individual visits any Internet site, a unique address called an "IP address" is recorded. DISH Network does not release any information about the collection of this address to any third party except under court order. DISH Network archives the log files in order to create aggregate statistical reports, detect errors at the Web site, and for security reasons. <br><br>

				IP reports for advertisement clicks are shared with the advertiser and advertising networks. This information may be stored in DISH Network databases and/or those of advertisers and advertising networks. However, advertisers usually have this information already since their server captures it when a person clicks on an ad. This is done to verify billing for the ads. No additional information associated with any specific user is provided to advertisers.<br><br>

				'Redirects' or the logging of clicks for external links is only done for advertisements. This is indicated by link to a URL such as '/redirect.asp?url= ...' The external URL is clearly marked in the "url=" portion. This is done to create the advertising reports described above in order to bill the advertiser.<br><br>

				Favicon.ico requests: Some browsers initiate a favicon.ico request made to a Web site when a user adds a site to their "Favorites" list. The ".ico" stands for "icon." It is a small 16x16 icon that replaces the standard icon used for a Web page. Favicon.ico requests are not tracked by DISH Network at this time.<br><br>

				<b>Access to Your Personal Information:</b><br>
				You may access your DISH Network account online by logging into the Customer Support Center on the dishnetwork.com Web site. You may change your current Login ID, Password, Security Question/Answer, and e-mail address at the Customer Support Center by selecting the My Account option.<br><br>

				You may also access your account information by calling <b>1-800-333-DISH (3474)</b> to speak with a DISH Network Customer  Service Representative.<br><br>

				<b> Other Web Sites and Interactive Television Applications:</b><br>
				There are several places throughout DISH Network Web sites and interactive television services where you may link to other organizations' Web sites and/or interactive television applications. When you click through to these sites or applications, DISH Network's Privacy Policy no longer applies. You are then subject to the privacy policy of the new site/application. DISH Network recommends you read the privacy policy for all third-party Web sites and interactive television applications in order to understand how they use your personal information.<br><br>

				<b>Notes:</b><br>
				The restrictions on the dissemination of personal information found in this policy may occasionally be updated. All changes will be posted to this Privacy Policy page. <br><br>

				If you have further questions regarding the DISH Network privacy policy, please e-mail us at:<br><br>
