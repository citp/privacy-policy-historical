## INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

We share personal information with service providers (processors) that act as an agent to perform tasks on Our behalf and under Our instructions. Examples include providers that assist with payment processing (i.e., PayPal), shipping (i.e., USPS), or providers that We contract with to send emails on Our behalf (i.e., MailChimp). If You process payments through Discogs Payments, in the U.S., You will be contracting for this service directly with Zink Media, LLC (d/b/a Discogs), and in the EU, You will be contracting for this service directly with Discogs B.V. sending emails on Our behalf, and fulfilling orders. In both cases, the payment processor working on Our behalf is Adyen B.V. This information is limited only to the information needed to perform the tasks.  If certain cookies are enabled on Your device, then We may also share cookie-related information with related service providers, such as analytics and advertising providers or social media companies. Additional information about the service providers/processors We use to support delivery of Our Service is set forth at [Processors List](https://support.discogs.com/hc/articles/360004623634-Discogs-Processors).  For additional information about service provider (processor) and third party privacy practices, please review those partes’ privacy policies and notices.

We will provide You with notice in the event We intend to share Your information with a third party (other than as described above) or for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by You. Prior to sharing such information, You will be provided with clear, conspicuous, and readily available mechanisms to opt in or out of such sharing, as required by applicable laws and regulations.  Except as described in this Policy, We **do not** otherwise share Your information with any third parties without Your consent.  We **do not** provide or sell email addresses or collection/wantlist information to any third party without Your consent.  Registered users can control the public availability of their collection/wantlist information in the account settings.  Please see “Notification and Other Privacy Preferences” below for additional information on limiting the sharing of Your information.

_Affiliates_ : We may share information with domestic and foreign affiliates controlling or controlled by Us, including Meta Zink Corporation, Discogs B.V., Discogs G.K., and NearMint, LLC, in order to provide the Service.

Zink Media, LLC is the primary Data Controller for personal information collected and processed through Our and Our affiliates’ sites and services. All sharing is subject to the Privacy Shield frameworks noted above and an intercompany data processing agreement. 

_Cookies_ : We may share information with advertising companies to serve You targeted advertisements, analytics providers, or social media providers.  This sharing is considered a “sale” under the California Consumer Privacy Act. You must be 16 years of age or older to use the Service. As a result, We do not sell personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.  The information is sourced from cookies/tags placed on Your device.

_Other Sharing_ : We may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Our [Terms of Service](https://support.discogs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009334333-Terms-of-Service), or as otherwise required by law enforcement or national security requirements. We may also disclose information when requested to comply with a court order, regulatory investigation, or governmental request.

_Sensitive/Protected Information_ : We do not currently collect or process sensitive, special, or protected information.  In the event We decide to collect sensitive, special, or protected categories of information (i.e., personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual), We will first obtain affirmative express consent (opt in) from You if We intend such information to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by You through the exercise of an opt in choice.  You will have the ability to opt out at any time.

## SAFEGUARDING YOUR INFORMATION

We use the following security measures and technologies to protect Your personal information:

  * Physical access controls, including secured premises to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to personal information, and ensuring that off-site data centers and server facilities adhere to similar appropriate controls;
  * System access controls to prevent unauthorized access and use of personal information, which vary based on the nature of information processing, but may include: industry standard firewalls, authentication via hashed and salted passwords;
  * Data access controls to ensure personal information is accessible and manageable only by properly authorized staff, including restricted catalogue query and application access, need-to-know access restrictions, and restrictions on the personal information that can be read, copied, modified and/or removed;

If We are the source of a breach, We will contact You and describe the breach, along with Our mitigation actions. Where applicable, We will provide appropriate identity theft prevention and mitigation services at no cost to the affected person for not less than 12 months. 



## TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Privacy and data protection laws and regulations and their associated transfer requirements vary by location (state, country and region).  We strive to comply with transfers of personal information under these laws and regulations by ensuring transfer is made under an appropriate legal basis.  We only transfer personal information to those parties that act as service providers or processors with respect to the Service We provide to You, with your consent, or under a legitimate interest or business, or commercial purpose, as described in this Policy.  We may also transfer personal information if required to do so by other applicable laws and regulations, including those related to criminal or civil matters.

Our technical infrastructure is located in the United States.  If you choose to use the Service, you agree to Our [Terms of Service](https://support.discogs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009334333-Terms-of-Service) which states that Your personal information will be hosted within Our United States infrastructure and Your personal information is required to be transferred to the United States as a result.

  * Data Processing Agreements
  * Model Clauses (EU standard contractual clauses)
  * EU Adequacy Decisions
