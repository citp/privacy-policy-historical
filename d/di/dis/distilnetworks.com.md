## INTRODUCTION

Distil is committed to respecting the privacy of the individuals that use Distil’s website. This Privacy Statement describes how Distil Networks, Inc., its affiliates, and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Distil”) collect, use, and share information about you when you visit Distil’s website (www.distilnetworks.com) and all other Distil websites that link to this Privacy Statement (collectively, the “Sites”).

## HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION

Distil collects information in two different ways. First, Distil may collect information from users of this Site. Second, Distil receives information from its subscribers in connection with their use of our services (the “Services”). We collect different information through each method. This Policy only covers information collected through the Site, and does not cover any information collected elsewhere online or offline by Distil, including the Services (unless specifically stated).

## INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE

Distil and its service providers (i.e., companies that perform business operations on Distil’s behalf, such as mailing, ad management, web analytics, data processing, or marketing) may collect information that you provide when you use the Sites, including when you contact Distil with a question, comment, or request; enter a search term on the Sites; subscribe to a Distil newsletter or publication; request whitepapers; respond to a marketing campaign; or register for an event or training. The information you provide to us may include, but is not limited to, your name, your contact information, your employer, your username and password for the Site, and other information you choose to provide to us.

## INFORMATION WE AUTOMATICALLY OR PASSIVELY COLLECT

Distil and its service providers may automatically collect certain information from your computer or mobile device over time and across different online services when you use the Sites. That information may include:

  1. the IP address associated with your computer or device,
  2. the domain name of your Internet Service Provider,
  3. the type of device you use to access the Sites,
  4. the type, characteristic and settings for browser you use to access the Sites,
  5. the operating system on your computer or device,
  6. the content or pages you view on the Sites,
  7. device identifiers associated with any device used to access the site,
  8. the frequency with which you visit the Site,
  9. duration of time that you use the Sites, and
  10. the content you view immediately before and after you access the Sites.



Distil may also use technologies that let us know whether you viewed Distil emails or other electronic communications, how you interacted with them, and whether the advertisements we place on the Sites are effective. Distil and its service providers may collect this information whenever you use the Sites or interact with our electronic communications. We may collect the information using “cookies,” web beacons, or similar technologies.

## OTHER INFORMATION

Distil may collect information about you from publicly or commercially available sources and combine that with the information that we collect when you use the Sites. That information may include your name, contact information, interests, firmographics and demographics. Distil may use the combined information as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, including to contact you with offers that we feel may be of interest to you. If you do not wish us to supplement the information we collect about you when you use the Sites with information from publicly or commercially available sources, please contact via one of the channels listed in the “How to Contact Distil” section.

## HOW DOES DISTIL USES YOUR INFORMATION?

Distil may use the information to:

  1. provide you with the content, information, products, and services that you request;
  2. help you complete transactions and orders;
  3. register you for events and trainings;
  4. improve the Sites and your experience when visiting the Sites;
  5. contact you for support or to provide you with information about Distil solutions;
  6. personalize the content you see on the Sites (e.g., inferring your location based on your IP address or other information to provide you with relevant content);
  7. deliver marketing communications, special offers, or advertisements that may be of interest to you, including the delivery of targeted advertisements that are based on your online activity on the Sites and other third-party websites (for example, if you view a page on a Distil website about a particular Distil offering, you may receive an online advertisement for that offering or a related one on a different Distil web page or on other online services you visit);
  8. analyze the effectiveness of advertising on the Site;
  9. better understand our customers and the people who visit the Site,
  10. better understand how people interact with the Site;
  11. troubleshoot the Site;
  12. develop new products, services, and solutions;
  13. detect and prevent potential fraud and security risks, and help others to do the same;
  14. identify and filter suspected malicious and other undesirable web traffic for this Site and other third-party websites, and help others to do the same;
  15. support Distil’s business operations.



## THIRD-PARTY CONTENT AND COLLECTION

The Sites may contain links to content or integrated content (like embedded videos) provided by third parties. For example, services such as YouTube may provide video content on the Sites, and services such as Survey Monkey may provide surveys about our services and solutions linked to from the Sites. The information practices of those third parties may differ from Distil’s. You should consult the privacy policies of any third party that provides content that you access through the Sites as Distil does not have control over the information that they collect, use, or share. Because your web browser may obtain integrated content directly from third-party servers, the third parties may be able to collect information as if you had visited their sites directly. These third parties may use the information they collect to track your online activities over time and across various websites.

We may include applications (or “widgets”) from social media providers that allow you to follow or interact with us on social media platforms. These widgets, such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like” button, are visible to you on the web page you visit. When you use these widgets or when you are logged in to those platforms, the respective social media providers may be able to collect information about your use of the Sites. Please visit the applicable social media network’s privacy policy to better understand their data collection practices and choices they make available to you. The privacy policy of the social media network controls the collection, use and disclosure of all personal information transmitted to that network. Depending upon your privacy settings with the social media providers, we may be able to collect information from your profile when you interact with the widgets.

## DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

Your personal information may be shared or disclosed:

  1. To third-party vendors, suppliers and contractors (e.g., customer management systems providers, payment processing providers, data analysis providers, IT services and infrastructure providers, customer service system providers, marketing service providers, e-mail delivery service providers, security services providers, etc.) who provide products or services to Distil;
  2. To our wholly-owned subsidiaries;
  3. By you, on message boards, blog or forum posts, and other services to which you may be able to post information and materials. Please note that any information and materials that you post or disclose through these services may become public information and available to the general public. As such, we urge you to exercise caution when disclosing information.
  4. To a third-party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business.
  5. As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to request from public or government authorities, including government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, or that of our affiliates, you or others; (g) at our discretion under emergency circumstances; (h) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.



## DISTIL’S POLICY REGARDING HOW OUR VENDOR’S USE YOUR INFORMATION.

With regards to those third-party service providers and other venders who process your personal information on behalf Distil, Distil recently adopted a policy not to permit such providers/vendors to use or disclose your personal information except to: (i) provide their respective products and services to Distil, and/or (ii) as otherwise disclosed in or permitted by this Privacy Policy. Distil will apply this policy to all vendors which Distil engages after the effective date of the current version of this Privacy Policy. For all such vendors that Distil has engaged prior to the effective date of the current version of this Privacy Policy, Distil has started the process of reviewing our contractual arrangements with such vendors, and if necessary, will attempt to modify such contractual arrangements to limit such vendors’ ability to use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## DOES DISTIL USE ANALYTIC SERVICES?

Distil works with certain third parties analytic service providers (e.g., Google in connection with its Google Analytics services) to provide us with information regarding Site traffic and usage. Some of these parties may collect personal information when you visit the Site or other online websites and services. We may provide these third parties with your information, and these third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, web beacons, and embedded scripts) on the Site and elsewhere online. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties and this Privacy Policy, including the section titles Distil’s Policy Regarding How Our Vendor’s Use Your Information does not cover those practices. For information as to how Google uses information they collect from you when use the Sites, see www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. 

## CHILDREN

This Site is not intended for children (i.e., individuals under the age of eighteen), and as such, Distil does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## “DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS

Distil supports the development and implementation of a standard “Do Not Track” (DNT) browser feature, which has been designed to provide users with control over the collection, sharing and use of information by third parties regarding their web-browsing activities. Once the DNT standardization is finalized by the W3C, Distil intends to honor a DNT setting. Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, the personal information you provide on the Site will not be shared outside of Distil without your consent. To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process. More information on DNT can be found at http://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/.

## WE OFFER USERS A CHOICE

Users of this Site who do not want Distil to contact them or their company for marketing purposes by email, postal mail, fax and/or phone, may opt out by contacting us in the manner specified below (see “How to Contact Distil”). 

Subject to the requirements set forth below, you may request to update or delete your personal information. Such request must be sent to Distil in the manner specified below (see How to Contact Distil) directly by the individual to which the personal information relates. Additionally, each request must contain sufficient information to specifically identify the personal information that you are requesting to delete or update. With regards to requests to update personal information, such request must include sufficient information for Distil to be able to determine how your personal information at issue is to be updated. Distil reserves the right to require you to verify your identify, in accordance with Distil’s then current policies and procedures, prior to acting upon your request. Please note that Distil can only update or delete your personal information to the extent that such personal information remains in Distil’s possession or control.

## DATA SECURITY

Distil strives to maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to safeguard the information collected from the Sites against loss, and unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. However, no information system can be 100% secure. Therefore, Distil cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Distil is not responsible for the security of information you transmit to the Sites over networks that Distil does not control. Such networks include the systems and networks owned or operated by any Internet service provider, network service provider or wireless network service provider. 

If you have any reason to believe your interaction with us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately in accordance with the “How to Contact Distil” section below.

## DATA RETENTION

Distil maintains your information until it determines there is no longer a valid business justification for holding that data. 

## CONSENT TO TRANSFER INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES 

The Site is operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us may be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Site, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen.

## CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information regarding Distil’s disclosure within the immediately preceding calendar year of that California resident’s personal information to third parties (and in some cases affiliates) for their direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Distil does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties and affiliates for those third parties’ and affiliates’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. At this time, we do not share personally identifiable information with third parties or affiliates for those third parties’ or affiliates’ direct marketing purposes. If we do so in the future, Distil will provide you with a choice prior to sharing your personally identifiable information with third parties and affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Distil offers that choice, Distil will not share your information with that identified third party or affiliate for its direct marketing purposes.
