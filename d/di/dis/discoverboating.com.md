# Customer Privacy Policy

Your privacy is a priority at Discover Boating, and we go to great lengths to protect it. We recognize your need to protect and manage any personal information you share with us. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information.

### Children's Privacy Statement

To protect the privacy of children, we adhere to the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). For more information, visit the Federal Trade Commission's COPPA site at [www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/adults.htm)

### Information Collection and Use

There are situations in which your personal information may help us give you better service. For example, we may ask for your personal information when you order a Free "How to Get Started with Boating" DVD, sign up for the Wave Newsletter, get Free Magazine Subscriptions or fill out a form to receive brochures and materials. At such times, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences. In some cases, we also ask you to provide information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service. 

### Website Traffic

As most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which DOES NOT identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites and Internet services are of most interest to them.

### Cookies

As is standard practice on many corporate websites, DiscoverBoating.com uses "cookies" and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our website. And we use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.

If you prefer not to enable cookies, please go to [www.discoverboating.com/info/cookies.htm](https://web.archive.org/info/cookies.htm), which explains step by step how you can disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the DiscoverBoating.com website will not be available once cookies are disabled.

### Newsletter

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as your name and email address.While we cannot prevent users from signing up other individuals to receive the newsletter, out of respect for our users' privacy, we provide a way for you to opt-out of these communications. Please see the _Choice and Opt-out_ section below.

In some of our email messages we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the DiscoverBoating.com website. When a customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through a web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.

In addition, we sometimes use pixel tags - tiny graphic images - to tell us what parts of our website customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we're only sending messages that are of interest to you.

### Information Disclosure

The National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) is the sole keeper of the information collected on the discoverboating.com website and any other programs related to the Discover Boating campaign. 

### When we disclose your information

We take your privacy very seriously. To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within the NMMA who will safeguard it in accordance with this privacy policy. There are also times when it may be necessary for NMMA to make certain personal information about you available to companies that we have a strategic relationship with or that perform work for us to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us process information, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy. Without such information being made available, it would be very difficult to have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback, or access certain services, offers, and content on the DiscoverBoating.com website.

You may provide us your contact information either separately or when requesting products or information from our website, such as the Free How to Get Started in Boating DVD, Boat Selector Tool, etc. Your contact information will be shared with third parties, including companies and organizations participating in or providing products and services to the recreational boating industry, unless you instruct us not to do this (see Choice/Opt-out below).

Additionally, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

### Choice/Opt-out

If you no longer wish to receive our Wave! Newsletter, you may opt-out of receiving it by clicking on the "Unsubscribe" link that appears at the bottom of each email. 

If you do not wish us to disclose your contact information to third parties while you are requesting your Free How to Get Started in Boating DVD, you will need to opt-out from the offer by un-checking the box at the bottom of the request form next to the _"I would like to be contacted by manufacturers and dealers"_ label. Your information will be shared with dealers and manufacturers if you fill out the request for brochures and informational materials from manufacturers and dealers while you are using the Boat Selector tool. You may later choose to opt out from these emails via Contact Us section of this website.

### Security

NMMA and Discover Boating take precautions to protect your information, including administrative, technical, and physical measures, to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. When you submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line. You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser.

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, please send an email to [support@discoverboating.com](mailto:support@discoverboating.com)

### Managing Personal Information

If your personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if you no longer desire our service, you can contact us by sending an email to [support@discoverboating.com](mailto:support@discoverboating.com) to correct, update or delete/deactivate your personally identifiable information. Alternatively, users can contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

### External Links

DiscoverBoating.com contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice, we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
