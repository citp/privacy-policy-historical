**We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies**

**We use common tracking technologies for a variety of reasons**. We may use technologies such as cookies, browser information, location information, device-level advertising and user identifiers, and pixel tags to uniquely identify your computer or device and the pages you view within our Online Services from time to time as well as to provide information to us and third parties about sites you visit after seeing Discover ads or offers. Our Service Providers may also use these tools. We use tracking tools:

  * To recognize new or past customers;
  * To store your password if you are registered on our Website or Mobile App;
  * To improve our Website and Mobile App;
  * To serve you with interest-based or targeted advertising (see below for more on interest-based advertising);
  * To observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms;
  * To better understand the interests of our customers and our Website and Mobile App visitors.



**You can control **cookies** and tracking tools on our Website.**Our Online Services do not respond to browser-level "do not track" settings because this setting is not universal across browsers. However, your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to clear past and reject future cookies. If you block cookies on your browser, certain features of our Online Services may not work. Additionally, if you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking activities we have described here will stop. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.

You can control tools on your mobile devices. For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your phone. If your phone allows, you can change app­specific location settings.

**We Conduct Interest-based Advertising**

We use interest-based advertising to target our advertising more effectively. To decide what is relevant to you, we use data you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties. We gather this information using the tracking tools described above. For example, we or our Service Providers or Business Partners might look at your purchases or browsing behaviors. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others.

You may see Discover advertisements on other websites you visit from time to time. Some of these ads are based on your Internet browsing history over time and across different websites. We (or Service Providers on our behalf) collect data this way. This is called interest-based or online behavioral advertising.

Interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising includes ads served to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return. They also include ads we think are relevant based on your online activities. These ads might be served on websites, apps or emails. We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads. They might be about our products or other companies' products.

**How you can opt out of interest-based advertising.** There are several ways you can opt-out of interest-based advertising. 

  1\. First, you can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from Discover or its partners [using this tool.](https://info.evidon.com/pub_info/15448?v=1&nt=0&nw=false)

  2\. Second, you can opt-out right from the ad itself. Ads served using interest-based advertising will have an Advertising Option icon in the ad. If you see that icon on Discover ads, you can click on it. You will then get an option to opt-out. Note that you may have to opt out separately for each of the Networks, Discover Global Network, Diners Club International and PULSE.

  3\. Third, the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to [opt-out of having their online behavior recorded](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and used for advertising purposes generally.

  4\. On mobile devices, you can control device-level advertising privacy settings. For example, toggle the "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS devices or "Opt out of interest-based ads" on Android devices.

  5\. We provided additional options to allow you to configure your online ad experience. See [Adchoices.](https://info.evidon.com/pub_info/15448?v=1&nt=0&nw=false)

If you opt out via methods 1-3 above, your choice will be stored as a cookie. If you remove or delete cookies you will need to renew your preferences. Your choices are also device and browser-specific. 

**We also advertise in other ways.** If you opt out of interest-based ads, you may still see Discover or its partners’ ads. These are ads that are not based on your Internet browsing history. Some may be generic. Others may be targeted to you or an advertising segment you are in. The websites or services where targeted ads appear will have instructions about how to modify your advertising preferences within those sites. We encourage you to review those instructions and settings.
