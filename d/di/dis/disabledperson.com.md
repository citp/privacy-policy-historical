disABLEDperson may use an adult user’s personally identifiable information to deliver to that user alone personalized content, relevant to our mission and other directed messages. In all such cases, our intent is to better serve our community by providing individual users access to information, and services that correspond with their personal preferences, expressed interests, or apparent site usage. Individuals have the right to stop their personally identifiable information from being used for such marketing and promotional purposes by sending an e-mail request to us at the address given at the end of this privacy policy. Also, any individual always has the right not to use the disABLEDperson.com Web site and thereby not to receive any directed content at any time.

While your individual information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group, based on site usage or expressed interests.

### Surveys

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). disABLEDperson uses contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company and services to a user’s expressed interests. Contact information may also be used to contact the user when necessary. Users may, however, opt-out of receiving future mailings, as described in the opt-out choice section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. disABLEDperson uses this data to tailor our user’s experience at our site, providing targeted information and services. This information is not shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.

disABLEDperson may place a “cookie” in the browser files of the user’s computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifiable information. Although the cookie could enable disABLEDperson.com to relate a user’s use of this site to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided, disABLEDperson.com does not do so except in cases as outlined above, or under an official law enforcement directive.

If you don’t like cookies, your Web browser may include an option that allows you not to accept them. However, we don’t recommend using this option, since it makes browsing our site a less enjoyable and rich experience.
