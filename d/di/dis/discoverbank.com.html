<p class="CopyTitle">Privacy Policy and Security</p>
	
<p><span class="Copyhead12">Discover Bank Privacy Policy</span>
<br>Last Updated October 2nd, 2007</p>

<p><strong>We are required by federal law to provide you with a
copy of our Privacy Policy each year. If you have
previously notified us about your privacy preferences,
as described in Section 4, it is not necessary to do so
again unless you decide to change your preferences.</strong></p>

<p class="Copyhead105">We Respect Your Privacy</p>
<p>Our mission is to provide you with superior products and
services, along with the peace of mind knowing that the
security of your personal information is our top priority. We
understand your concerns about guarding information about
you and your Account. We want to assure you that we have
taken steps, and will continue to take steps, to safeguard that
information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes our efforts to meet these
objectives. It includes a summary of the following important
information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A listing of the personal information we collect;</li>
	<li>The circumstances in which we may share information
with others;</li>
	<li>The ways we safeguard the confidentiality and security
of information; and</li>
	<li>The steps you may take to limit our sharing of such
information with others. See Section 4 for complete
details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read our Privacy Policy carefully. It will help you
understand how we collect and share information.</p>


<p class="Copyhead105">1. What Personal Information Do We Collect?</p>
<p>To serve you better and manage our business, it is important
that we collect and maintain accurate personal information
about you. We obtain this information from applications and
other forms you submit to us, from your dealings with us and
others, from consumer reporting agencies and from other
sources, such as our Web sites. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We may obtain information such as your name, address and
date of birth from applications and other forms you submit
to us.</li>
	<li>We may obtain information such as Account balances,
payment history, your use of your Account and the types of
services you prefer from your transactions and other
dealings with us and others.</li>
	<li>We may obtain information such as the balances of your
loans with other lenders and your payment history with
others from consumer reporting agencies.</li>
	<li>We may obtain information such as your Internet service
provider, your email address, your computer’s operating
system and Web browser, your Web site use and your
product and service preferences from your visits to our
Web sites.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Copyhead105">2. Is Personal Information Shared with Others?</p>

<p>We limit the sharing of information with others. Many of
the offers you receive for products and services are provided
directly to you from us. For example, a company may come
to us with a special offer for our Depositors. After careful
consideration of the nature of the offer and the company, we
will create a list of Depositors who may be interested in the
offer based on certain characteristics. We will send the offer
directly to those Depositors on behalf of the company by, for
example, including an insert in their Account statement or
mailing the offer ourselves. We control the information used to
make the offer; we do not share the list or any information
about our Depositors with the company. However, please
understand that if you do receive this type of offer from us and
choose to take advantage of it, the company may then learn
information about you because only Depositors with certain
characteristics received the offer.</p>

<p>There are, however, circumstances in which we may share the
information we collect about you, as described in Section 1,
with other companies in order to provide you with access to
products and services and to service your Account effectively,
as detailed below. We require these companies to adhere to
our privacy standards and to use this information only for the
limited purpose for which it was shared. We do not allow them
to disclose it to others without our prior approval.</p>

<p><strong>a. Sharing Personal Information with Our Corporate Family</strong><br>
Our corporate family offers a wide variety of products and services that
can help you manage your finances. In order to provide you with
access to these products and services, we may share the information
we collect about you, as described in Section 1, with other members of
our corporate family. These companies include financial service
providers that offer lending, deposit and credit-related products.</p>

<p><strong>b. Sharing Personal Information with Non-Affiliated Parties for Marketing Purposes</strong><br>
We may share the information we collect about you, as
described in Section 1, with non-affiliated third parties in order to
provide you with access to products and services offered directly
by these companies that may be of value to you. These
companies include financial service providers, such as insurance
companies, and non-financial companies, such as retailers.</p>

<p><strong>c. Sharing Personal Information with Others</strong><br>
We may share the information we collect about you, as
described in Section 1, with companies that perform support or
marketing services on our behalf, such as mailing, market
research and data processing; or other financial institutions
with which we have joint marketing agreements. We may also
share such information as permitted by law.</p>

<p class="Copyhead105">3. How Do We Protect the Confidentiality, Security and Integrity of Information About You?</p>

<p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to
protect the information we collect about you. Access to such
information is restricted to individuals who need it in order to
service your Account or provide products and services to you,
and who are trained in the proper handling of such information.
Employees who violate these confidentiality requirements are
subject to our disciplinary process. Where third parties provide
support services, we require them to conform to our privacy
standards.</p>

<p>It is important that the information we maintain about you is
accurate and complete. If you see information in your Account
statements or elsewhere which suggests that our information
is incomplete or inaccurate, please write to us at Discover
Bank, P.O. Box 7112, Dover, DE 19903-9955 so that we can
update this information.</p>

<p class="Copyhead105">4. How Can You Limit Sharing of Information About You?</p>

<p>We respect your privacy and offer you choices as to whether
we may share information about you with others. You have the
option to tell us not to share the information we collect about
you, as described in Section 1, with non-affiliated third parties.
You also have the option to tell us not to share certain
information we collect about you, as described in Section 1,
with companies in our corporate family. However, this option is
limited to information about your eligibility for credit obtained
from your application, such as your income, and from consumer
reporting agencies, such as your credit history. If you indicate a
preference for either of these options, please understand that
you may not receive offers for products and services provided
by other companies that could help you lower your costs,
maximize your financial resources or manage your finances. <strong>To
indicate your preferences, please call us at 1-800-347-
7000 or write to us at Discover Bank, PO Box 7112,
Dover, DE 19903-9955. If you have previously notified us
about your privacy preferences, it is not necessary to do
so again unless you decide to change your preferences.</strong>
Your written request should include your name, address,
telephone number and Account number(s) and should not be
sent with any other correspondence. In order to process your
request, we require that the request be provided by you
directly and not through a third party. You will need to provide
us with your preferences for each Account you have with us.
</p>
<p>You may notify us about your preferences at any time. Your
request will remain in effect until you notify us otherwise. We
will honor your request and not share this information we
collect about you, except as permitted by law. For example,
federal law permits us to share information about you with
consumer reporting agencies, service providers and financial
institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. It
also permits us to share information about our experiences and
transactions with you, such as your Account balance with
other members of our corporate family. If you are a new
Customer, we will not share any information about you, except
as permitted by law, for thirty days after we provide this Policy
to you in order to give you an opportunity to inform us about
your preferences. If you are an existing Customer, please
understand that you may continue to receive marketing offers
directly from other companies that were already in production
prior to the processing of your request.
</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is provided to the primary Customer listed
on the Account. However, any joint Depositor has the right to 
notify us about preferences and we will treat that request as
applying to the entire Account. We do not share information
about former customers, except as permitted by law. This
notification supercedes all previously issued Privacy Policies.
We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy from time to
time and we will notify you if we do.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is provided to you by Discover Bank.
Unless otherwise specified, this policy applies to products
and services obtained at our retail bank office in Greenwood,
Delaware or deposit Accounts opened by mail, by phone, or
on our Web sites. It is part of your Account Agreement and
provides a further explanation of how we collect and share
information. You may have other rights under state laws that
apply to this information. Please note that this Privacy Policy
does not apply to any credit card accounts you have with us,
as well as other financial products and services provided to
you by us and our affiliates. You will receive a separate
privacy policy for those financial products and services and
you will need to indicate your preferences for each of these
separately as disclosed in the notice.</p>

<p><strong>Vermont Residents</strong> — Your state law requires financial
institutions to obtain your consent prior to sharing
information about you with others. Except as permitted by
law, we will not share information we collect about you with
non-affiliated third parties or companies in our corporate
family unless you call us at 1-800-347-7000 and authorize us
to do so.
</p>

<p><strong>California Residents</strong> — Your state law requires financial
institutions to obtain your consent prior to sharing
information about you with non-affiliated third parties. Except

<p class="Copyhead12"><a name="security"></a>Security Information</p>
	
<p><b>Creating a Safe Internet Environment</b>
</p><p>Internet security is a top priority at Discover Bank. That's why we use sophisticated encryption technology to keep your personal and financial information private. 

</p><p>You can enhance your online safety by keeping your Account numbers and passwords private and by guarding your other financial information. 

</p><p><b>Your User ID and Password </b>
</p><p>To access the Banking Center, you need to create a user ID and password. To help ensure that only you can view your Account information: 
</p><ul><li>Never reveal your password to anyone 
</li><li>Keep your password secret 
</li><li>Change your password periodically
</li></ul> 

<p>Find out more about your Banking Center User ID and Password in our <a href="index.asp?pID=misc&amp;sID=faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.

</p><p><b>End Your Secure Session Completely </b>
</p><p>If you do not log out of the Banking Center, you could potentially allow others using the same computer to access information saved or cached in the memory of the browser. When you are ready to leave the Banking Center always: 
</p><ul>
<li>Log out by clicking the "Banking Center Log Out" link</li>
<li>Close your browser's window before you leave the computer as an extra precaution</li>
</ul> 

<p><b>Protect Your Account from Scams </b>
</p><p>An increasingly common scam-called "phishing" uses official-looking e-mails to deceive consumers into disclosing their sensitive personal information. The e-mail often directs the recipient to a "look-alike" Web site of a legitimate business, tricking consumers into thinking they are responding to a valid request. Here are some ways to avoid getting caught by one of these scams:
</p><ul>
<li>Do not provide your vital Account information by e-mail or phone unless you initiated the contact. Discover&nbsp;Bank will never send an e-mail asking you to reply with your Account or personal information.</li>
<li>If the URL is not Discoverbank.com, close your browser window immediately.</li>
<li>Add the Discoverbank.com Banking Center Log In page to your browser's Favorites or Bookmarks menu.</li>
</ul> 

<p>If you receive an e-mail that claims to be from Discover&nbsp;Bank that you suspect might be fraudulent, call<br>
<b>1-800-347-7000</b> TDD(1-800-347-7454) immediately. A Customer Service Representative can verify whether or not the e-mail was actually sent by Discover&nbsp;Bank.
	
</p><p class="Copyhead12">Prevent Identity Theft</p>

<p>One of the fastest growing crimes in the United States is identity theft. Identity theft happens when someone uses your name or personal information to commit financial fraud. By following these simple steps, you can help safeguard your personal information and protect yourself and your credit rating.</p>
	
<p class="Copyhead105">Protect Your Identity</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Keep your personal information in a safe place.</span> Don't carry your birth certificate, social security card or passport with you unless you need to use it. Always make copies of the originals and keep them in a safe place. If you lose such documents, contact the appropriate government office immediately.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Review your financial statements regularly.</span> Check your credit card and bank statements each month for any suspicious activity. Request and check your credit report at least once a year for mistakes or fraudulent use. If you come across any suspicious activity on your accounts, contact your financial institution immediately. If you notice suspicious activity on your Discover Bank Account, call <br>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">1-800-347-7000</span> immediately.</p> 

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Dispose of confidential information securely.</span> Shred important documents to prevent con artists from collecting private information from your trash.</p> 

<p class="Copyhead105">Reporting Fraud</p>
 
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Act quickly.</span> If you suspect your identity or financial information is being used fraudulently, call your bank and credit card companies immediately. The sooner you act, the better the chances of catching the culprit and of limiting the damage.</p> 

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">File a police report.</span> The best way for the authorities to bring criminals to justice and prevent future fraud is through sharing information. Your police report helps authorities gain insight on how the crime was committed.</p> 

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Prevent future fraud.</span><br>
The minute you learn your identity is being used fraudulently, place a fraud alert on your name and social security number. This helps prevent future fraud and further tarnishing of your personal and financial records. Call the three national credit-reporting organizations and the Social Security Administration immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and Social Security number. The numbers are: 
<ul>
	<li> Equifax: 1-800-525-6285</li>
	<li> Experian: 1-888-397-3742</li>
	<li> TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289</li>
	<li> Social Security Administration (Fraud Line): 1-800-269-0271</li>
</ul>
