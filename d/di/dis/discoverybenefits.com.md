We are dedicated to protecting the information we collect, maintain and use to provide services for you. To help you better understand our commitment to protecting your personal information, we are providing you with the following notice describing our practice with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of customer information: 

  * We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information our customers share with us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except in strict adherence as permitted by law.

  * We will limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business.

  * We will ensure that employees comply with our established privacy policies and procedures, which exist to protect the confidentiality of customer information. Employees will access information only on a business need-to-know basis. We educate our employees on the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy. Employees who violate our privacy policies will be subject to the disciplinary process.

  * We will not reveal customer information to any external organization unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosure or agreements, have been authorized by the customer, or are required by law.

  * We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our customer information by use of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your non-public personal information. We will not record personal or sensitive information when you visit our Web site unless you enter the information voluntarily.

  * Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance.

  * We will not use or share — internally or externally personally identifiable medical information for any purpose other than the administration of a customer's account or claim, or as disclosed to the customer when the information is collected, or to which the customer consents.

  * We have established procedures to ensure that your information is accurate, current and complete.

  * We will continue to provide this notice at the frequency required by law and will notify customers of any modification at least annually. We will continue to follow the policies set forth in this notice even when a customer relationship no longer exists. However, that party will no longer receive an annual notice.
