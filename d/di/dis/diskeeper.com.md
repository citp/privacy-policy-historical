**PRIVACY OF PERSONAL DATA  
POLICY AND EXPLANATION** **Security**  
Executive Software has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information. We take stringent precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. We do not sell or give away information obtained from customers and prospective customers. **Enforcement**  
If for some reason you believe Executive Software has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at [privacy@executive.com](mailto:privacy@executive.com), and we will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain that the words Privacy Policy are in the subject line. **Notice**  
To customize our site to your needs, we will initiate a one time only request for information from you when you attempt to access a customizable section of our web site. Such data will enable us to identify you each time you enter our site and provides us with some marketing demographic data. This information is provided through a [ User Profile](https://web.archive.org/profile/profile.asp) when you first attempt to download freeware or trialware, subscribe to e-mail newsletters or sign up for field testing. We utilize your personal information for these three purposes:

|  | - | To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.  
---|---|---  
| - | To help us create content most relevant to you.  
| - | To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from Executive Software.  
  
**Consent**  
If you decide to register or provide personal information, you will be able to select the types of information you want to receive from Executive Software. If you do not want Executive Software to communicate with you about other offers regarding Executive Software products, new software, events, or services by e-mail, postal mail or telephone, you may deselect the appropriate option. **Access**  
We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time at the [ User Profile](https://web.archive.org/profile/profile.asp) page. There you can:  


| - | View and edit personal information you have already given us.  
---|---|---  
| - | Tell us whether you want Executive Software to send you marketing information.  
| - |  Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products.  
| - |  Register. Once you register, you won't need to do it again. Wherever you go on our web site, your information stays with you.  
  
  
**Electronic Product Registration**  
When you buy and install a new product, we will offer you the option to register your purchase online. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile for you from your product registration information. If you ever want to review or update that information, you can visit the [ User Profile](https://web.archive.org/profile/profile.asp) page, click on Update Profile, and edit any of the personal information in your profile. If you haven't already created a user profile, we will ask you to do so. This ensures that only you can access your information.  
As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.

When you register, we send this information number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours, allowing you to download freeware and trialware and order free newsletters without having to resubmit information. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to re-register - just use your User Name and Password to identify yourself.
