### 6\. Where we store your Personal Data

The data that we collect from you is stored on our servers and in our Cloud facilities in the United States, Europe, or any other country in which Condusiv or its subsidiaries, partners or service providers maintain facilities, which entails a transfer outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to areas where privacy laws may be less strict than in the EEA.

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. 

### 7\. How long we store your Personal Data

We will keep your personal data for as long as we need it, or as otherwise prescribed by law, for the purposes set out above, and so this period will vary depending on your interactions with us. We may also keep a record of correspondence with you (for example if you have made a complaint about a product) for as long as is necessary to protect us from a legal claim. In some cases, there is a legal requirement to keep Personal Data for a minimum period of time. Unless this is the case, we do not keep your Personal Data for any longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected or for which it is to be further processed. 

Please note that where you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we will keep a record of your email address to ensure we do not send you marketing emails in future.

You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data for any purpose, including for marketing purposes. You also have the right to request that we identify what Personal Data we hold about you, that we correct any incorrect or outdated information, or that we erase your Personal Data, unless we have a legitimate reason to retain the Personal Data (such as if we are required to do so for legal reasons).

If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties or the content of linked sites although we do encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such parties or websites.
