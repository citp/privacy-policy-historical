## Privacy of Personal Data Policy and Explanation

  


### Security

Condusiv Technologies Corporation has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information. We take stringent precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. We do not sell or give away information obtained from customers and prospective customers. We do however, work closely with our resellers and distributors to ensure that prospective customers in territories outside of the USA, which are not handled in-house, are responded to by the appropriate Condusiv Technologies reseller. 

### Enforcement

If for some reason you believe Condusiv Technologies has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at [privacy@condusiv.com](mailto:privacy@condusiv.com), and we will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain that the words Privacy Policy are in the subject line.

### Notice

To customize our site to your needs, we will initiate a one-time only request for information from you when you attempt to access a customizable section of our web site. Information collected includes your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, company name, type of business, number of employees and job title.

This information is provided through a [User Profile](https://web.archive.org/profile/account.aspx) when you first attempt to download freeware or trial evaluation software, subscribe to Email newsletters or sign up for field testing. We utilize your personal information for these three purposes: 

  * To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.
  * To help us create content most relevant to you.
  * To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from Condusiv Technologies.

### Consent

If you decide to register or provide personal information, you will be able to select the types of information you want to receive from Condusiv Technologies. 

### System Monitoring

System Monitoring is an optional feature offered within Condusiv products that allows users to anonymously share their user experience for the purpose of helping Condusiv Technologies Corporation improve future products. System Monitoring allows for the collection of information about your system environment with respect to resources impacted by the general function and use of your system. Information collected through the use of this feature will be used to generate a report to present this data about your system. Providing this information will help Condusiv Technologies to design future products to improve the use of your system. Information collected or provided to Condusiv Technologies does not include any personal or private information. 

### Access

We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time at the [User Profile](https://web.archive.org/profile/profile.aspx) page. 

### Electronic Product Registration

When you buy and install a new product, we will offer you the option to register your purchase online. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile for you from your product registration information. If you ever want to review or update that information, you can visit the [User Profile](https://web.archive.org/profile/profile.aspx) page, click on Update Profile, and edit any of the personal information in your profile. If you haven't already created a user profile, we will ask you to do so. This ensures that only you can access your information.  
As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.

When you register, we send this information number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours, allowing you to download freeware and evaluation software and order free newsletters without having to resubmit information. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to re-register - just use your User Name and Password to identify yourself.
