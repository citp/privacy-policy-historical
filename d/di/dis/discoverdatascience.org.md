## Key Terms Used in This Policy

“Cookies” are unique identifiers usually in the form of small data files placed on your device that send certain information about your activity on the website or in an email communication back to us or the authorized third party that served the cookie.

## How We Share Personal Information

We will not disclose any Personal Information submitted to us directly via email. Should we need to disclose Personal Information to a third party in order to resolve an issue, we will request explicit permission from you before doing so.

Please read their policies prior to submitting.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE ACTS AND/OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD-PARTY VENDORS.

Finally, we use service providers for web hosting, email hosting, Site analytics, and other internal business purposes. These service providers may receive access to Personal Information.
