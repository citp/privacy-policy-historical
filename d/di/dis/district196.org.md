We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information (e.g., filling out a Web form, registering for an event or participating in a survey).

In addition to the personal information described above, our system collects server log data which may include an IP address, the type of browser and operating system used, the time of day visited, the pages viewed and the information requested through searches. We aggregate this data and use it for statistical purposes, helping us to ascertain, for example, the amount of interest in portions of our website and ways to improve the navigation and content of our website.

##### **Cookies**

Another form of anonymous website user information that we are collecting is called a “cookie.” A cookie is a small text file of information that our web server stores on your computer to distinguish your visit to our site from others who may be visiting our site at the same time. This cookie is only active while your computer is visiting our site and is not being used for marketing purposes or for any reason that may compromise your privacy. For instance, the Check Please service uses cookies to assure that each computer is sent the correct page of information that they are currently requesting. Cookies are also used to let us know if a computer is logged on to one of our sites. In addition to being anonymous, the cookies are set to expire when you close your browser. District 196 does not use persistent cookies (cookies that are retained on your computer after you close your browser).

##### **Disclosure of Information  **

Some of the identifiable personal information you provide through e-mail lists, web forms and surveys and account services may be classified as private data. The data may be shared with employees and agents of District 196 as necessary to provide the specific service requested, to track the success of programs, to complete required state and federal reports and to maintain the functioning and security of District 196 systems. It is not shared outside of District 196 except as authorized by law.
