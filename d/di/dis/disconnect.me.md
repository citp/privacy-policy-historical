# Privacy policy | Disconnect

## Disconnect privacy policy

We’re committed to protecting your privacy and collecting only the minimum amount of info needed to provide our software and services — referred to as “Services”. Your use of the Services indicates you agree to this policy and [our terms of use](https://web.archive.org/terms). 

#### Summary

Nothing in this policy contradicts the following statements:

  1. We don’t collect your personal info, including your IP address, unless you give us your email address to log in or correspond. 
  2. We don’t sell your personal info to advertisers or other third parties. 
  3. We share your personal info only when legally required, or when reasonably necessary to prevent harm in an emergency situation.
  4. We retain your personal info, excluding info you make public, for no more than 30 days after you request deletion. 



#### Complete terms

As used in this policy, “Personal Info” is data that can identify a particular person. Aggregate data isn’t considered Personal Info. 

######  1\. Disconnect never collects your Personal Info except to log you in or communicate with you 

Our browser extensions don’t collect any of your Personal Info. Unlike most websites, our site doesn’t collect your IP address. 

We may request your email address or a username to communicate with you. This info is used only as you’d expect and deleted upon request. 

Optionally, you may provide your email address and a username to take credit for your work when applying [privacy icons](https://icons.disconnect.me/). 

We use MailChimp to manage our newsletter and other email lists. There’s no third-party tracking in messages we send through MailChimp besides MailChimp’s own analytics, which may aggregate how many subscribers open a message or click the links inside. MailChimp’s privacy policy is available at <http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy>. 

To improve the Services and your experience on our site, we may use non-identifying browser cookies to collect aggregate data like your browser type, your operating system, or the links you click to navigate to and from our site. 

###### 2\. Disconnect never sells your Personal Info

We don’t receive payment in cash or in kind from third parties in exchange for your Personal Info. Further, we don’t allow third parties to collect info about you on our site through cookies or other means. 

######  3\. Disconnect shares your Personal Info only in specific circumstances 

There are a few, rare circumstances when we may have to share your Personal Info either to obey the law or protect our rights. We’ll share your Personal Info only to comply with laws or legally enforceable requests, to enforce our own rights and contracts with users or third parties, or to prevent harm to others and their property in an emergency situation. 

In all instances, we’ll share the minimum info necessary to meet the immediate need and inform you of our disclosure when legally and practically possible. 

######  4\. Disconnect retains your Personal Info for one month or less 

We remove your Personal Info from our records within 30 days of any request to do so. However, we reserve the right to display your public posts and comments on our forum, blog, and otherwise in conjunction with the Services. 

#### Changes to this policy

We may make small, inconsequential changes to this policy with or without notice to you, so you’re encouraged to review the policy from time to time. Substantive changes to this policy will be emailed to users who subscribe to the Disconnect newsletter or to those who submit a request to [support@disconnect.me](mailto:support@disconnect.me). 

#### Contact

You can contact us at [support@disconnect.me](mailto:support@disconnect.me) if you have any questions about this policy.
