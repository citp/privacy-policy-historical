# Privacy | Admedo

_Updated  on May 17th, 2018_

Hi.

We’re Admedo. 

We want to make advertising easier for everyone. And that includes people being advertised to. Like you.

Advertising is an important part of the internet. It’s one of the ways you find out about things you might be interested in: a new model of car or a book, a TV show or movie. It’s also how a lot of websites and apps you use make money to pay their staff, without asking it from you directly.

Without advertising your favourite websites might no longer be free. They might not exist at all.

When they’re good, ads can be very clever. They can be funny and memorable, and even useful – like when you had no idea what to do for Mother’s Day, and saw an ad for a hot air balloon ride.

But we all know advertising can be really annoying. It can also be creepy or inappropriate, or be downright disgusting.

Advertising online is also tricky, because it involves a lot of data. And recently there’s been news about how data can go really wrong.

So we’re going to tell you everything: about the data we collect, what we do with it, and what you can do about it.

#### Other Important Details

###### Securing Data

We use technical and organisational measures to protect personal data from unauthorised access. These may include encryption and other information security technologies, applied to our networks and systems. However, no mechanism for either storing data, or transmitting data over the Internet, is completely secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the safety or security of any information you transmit to us.

  Admedo processes information in a way that is aligned with the purposes for which it was collected. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use.

###### Moving Data Around

The information that we collect from you and about you may be transferred to and stored in a country other than your country of residence, such as another European country or the USA, which may not offer the same level of protection of personal information as your country of residence.

  Where your personal data is being transferred outside the EU, we will either undertake an assessment of the level of protection in light of the circumstances surrounding the transfer or:

  * Only transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA; or
  * Ensure we have an agreement in place with the recipient under which they are under a duty to protect your data to the same standards as those in place in the EEA; or 
  * Transfer it to US organisations that are signed up to the EU-US Privacy Shield scheme; or 
  * We will make sure that any transfers are not repetitive and only limited to the minimum amount of information possible. In certain circumstances we may need to seek your consent unless there is an overriding legal need to transfer the information]; and
  * In all cases where your information is transferred outside the EEA, you have a right to contact us for a copy of the measures we have put in place, by email to [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)



###### How Long We Keep Data

We retain the cookie ID for as long as this is necessary for our legitimate business purposes.  
Cookies set via the Platform expire within 13 months of setting. Browsing activity associated with an Admedo cookie expires within the lesser of: 60 days of last known activity and 13 months of setting.

Our log level data is cleansed of any personal data, such as IP address within three days of being produced as a result of interaction with a third party web page we are partnered with, or after being served with an advert via the Admedo platform.  
 

###### Children

Our Platform and services are designed and directed to individuals of 16 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If we are made aware that we have received personal information from someone under 16, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.

  We do not market by email or other electronic means to children under the age of 16 anywhere.

  In adherence to EDAA requirements, we do not create segments for OBA purposes that are specifically designed to target children (age 12 and under). While this does not mean that ad delivery will not occur, it means that we will not specifically target ads to children ages 12 and under.

####  Your Rights

###### Opting out

Personalised ads, sometimes referred to as targeted or interest-based ads, are based on information about you, such as the products you view online, visits to websites where we provide ads or content.

You can manage cookies in the privacy settings on the web browser you are using.

Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.  
 

#### How you can withdraw your consent

You have the right at any time to withdraw any explicit consent you have given us to process your personal data.

#### How you can restrict or object to us using your data

You can ask us to suspend the way in which we are using your information in certain scenarios, or object to our processing your data where we are relying on a legitimate interest ground (or those of a third party) and you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases where you object, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.  
Please note that if you want us to restrict or stop processing your data this may impact on our ability to provide our services. Depending on the extent of your request we may be unable to continue providing you with our service.

Any queries or concerns about the way in which your data is being used can be sent to [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

From time to time we may revise this Policy. The date of the last update can be found at the top of this Policy. If we make revisions that materially change or affect whether or how we collect or use personal information, we will notify you and we’ll indicate when such changes will become effective.
