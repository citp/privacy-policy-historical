Four Sight Partners, LLC (“Company”, “ ** _we_** ,” “ ** _us_** ” or “ ** _our_** ”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of this website and the family of services and software applications we provide under or in connection with this website (this website and such services and software applications being the “ _ **Services**_ ”). We created this Privacy Policy (this “ ** _Policy_** ”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Services, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Policy is only applicable to the Services and not to any other websites that you may be able to access in connection with the Services, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.

If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is age 13 or under, we will promptly disable that user’s account and delete any personal information in that account.

In order for you to access certain Services, we require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you (“ ** _Personal Information_** ”). Personal Information collected may, without limitation, include the following: registration, online surveys, and other online forms that ask users to provide their names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and other contact information, as well as their date of birth, location data, if enabled (including without limitation, GPS coordinates traveled, cellular tower identifications, Wi-Fi access points, altitude and any other information provided by your mobile device or computer), text, audio, images, videos, information transferred to the Service and any other content that you may submit to us, if any, including without limitation, any information you authorize us to import or export to or from select social networking and other websites operated by third party companies (“ ** _Integrated Third Party Companies_** ”).

You may use some portions of the Service without creating an account. If you choose to use the Service as an unregistered guest, we will not collect any Personal Information from you unless you expressly authorize us to do so.

##### What Additional Information Do We Collect?

**Automatic Collection.** Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet), Internet service provider, domain servers, browser type, computer platform, referring website, date, time and duration of access, and links clicked through. No Personal Information about you is revealed in this process. The Services may also gather anonymous “traffic data” that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the Services.

**Cookies.** From time to time, we may use the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer that tracks information about your visit to our Services. We do not set any personally identifiable information in cookies. Cookies help us customize your content experience (for example to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Services) and to learn which areas of our Services are useful and which areas need improvement. Our business partners (advertisers) may use cookies on our Services. We have no access to or control over these cookies once our business partners have been given permission to set cookies. This Policy covers the use of cookies by us only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at our Services may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.

We may use your Mobile Device ID to provide a tailored experience for you. In addition, the Mobile Device ID information may be collected in order to determine the aggregate number of unique devices using our service or parts of our service, to track total usage, analyze data, and communicate with you more effectively. We may combine your Mobile Device ID with information from third parties to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our service. We do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties in association with your Mobile Device ID.

**Geographic Location.** When you access the Services via a mobile device, we may also collect the geographic location of your mobile device (including without limitation, GPS coordinates traveled, cellular tower identifications, Wi-Fi access points, altitude and any other information provided by your mobile device or computer) if your mobile device is set to transmit such information. We may use your geographic location to provide a tailored experience for you. In addition, the geographic location information may be used to analyze our Services traffic. We may combine your geographic location with information from third parties to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our Services.

  * **Sale of Assets.** In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy portions of our company or other companies or assets, including the information collected through the Services. If we sell substantially all of our assets, or the assets of one of our business lines are acquired, customer information will be one of the assets transferred to the acquirer and that entity and its affiliates may use your Personal Information under the terms of their own privacy policies which may differ from this Privacy Policy.



**User Accounts.** When you register to create an account, we ask you to provide certain Personal Information. If we propose to use Personal Information in ways that are less restrictive than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of such use of your Personal Information for such identified other purposes. In addition, you may decline to submit Personal Information or location information to us; however, this means that we will be unable to provide certain Services to you.

**Use of Anonymous Information.** We use anonymous information to analyze our Services traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. In addition, we may use anonymous IP addresses and Mobile Device ID’s to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Services, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and transaction information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.

**Use of Cookies.** We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our Services, and for other purposes. Promotions or advertisements displayed on our Services may contain cookies. We do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers on our Services.

**Integrated Third Party Companies.** We provide for integration of the Service with select Integrated Third Party Companies, in order to allow (among other things) the transfer of certain Personal Information between us and Integrated Third Party Companies. Integrated Third Party Companies have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices, over which we have no control. Any Personal Information provided to us by Integrated Third PartyCompanies is governed by this Privacy Policy.

##### SECURITY

The Services have security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss, misuse, to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration.
