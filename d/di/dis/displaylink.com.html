      <p><strong>DISPLAYLINK (UK) LIMITED PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
      <p>DisplayLink (UK) Limited ("DisplayLink") is committed to protecting your privacy and this Privacy Policy sets out our privacy practices. Please take the time to review this Privacy Policy carefully as it tells you how your personal information will be treated by us.</p>
      <p>By using the DisplayLink (UK) Limited site (www.DisplayLink.com) (the “Site”) and our services, you unconditionally agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>DisplayLink wants to offer you the best possible internet experience. Consequently, additional functions, features, products or services are incorporated into the Site from time to time. This, and our commitment to protecting the privacy of your personal information, may result in periodic changes to this Privacy Policy. As a result, please remember to refer back to this Privacy Policy regularly to review any amendments.</p>
      <p>Any questions regarding our Privacy Policy should be directed to DisplayLink’s Privacy Policy Manager (John Martyn), or alternatively see the section “Contacting us” below.</p>
      <p>What do we collect and use personal information for?</p>
      <p><strong>In order to:</strong></p>
      <p>record and respond to any enquiries or other communications you make via the Site;<br>
        customise the service we provide to you;<br>
        to enable you to access password protected areas of the Site;<br>
        administrate or otherwise carry out our obligations in relation to any agreement you have with us;<br>
        verify your identity;<br>
        anticipate and resolve problems with any goods or services supplied to you;<br>
        carry out market research and tracking of sales data;<br>
        send you information about our products and services;<br>
        share information with other DisplayLink group companies;<br>
        analyse aggregated data (that is personal data that has been aggregated to the extent that the identity of the individuals is removed from the analysis and results) from customers and interested parties to help us make business decisions;<br>
        We may need to collect and process personal information about you through the Site (including your name, your username and password, address, company name, gender, and, in connection with your password (where applicable), an answer to a question that only you would know). We may ask you for this information through our Site, or via one of our telephone operators. Certain information is collected automatically, as described later in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Although we do not make it compulsory to give us every item of information we ask for, the more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we can tailor our services for you.</p>
      <p>Certain DisplayLink services may be offered in conjunction with one of our partners. If in order to use such a service, your personal information may need to be shared or only our partner may need to collect and use it, then we will tell you when you first go to use that service. Please note that certain services may be unavailable if you do not want to disclose the personal information you are asked for.</p>
      <p><strong>Log files/IP addresses</strong></p>
      <p>When you visit our Site, we automatically log your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server. We use IP addresses to help us administer the Site and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information.</p>
      <p><strong>Non personal information</strong></p>
      <p>We may automatically collect non-personal information about you such as the type of internet browsers you use or the site from which you linked to our Site. You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on our Site. We may from time to time supply the owners or operators of third party sites from which it is possible to link to our Site with information relating to the number of users linking to our Site from their sites. You cannot be identified from this information.</p>
      <p><strong>Information placed on your computer</strong></p>
      <p>We may store some information (commonly known as a “cookie”) on your computer when you look at our Site. This information facilitates your use of our Site and helps us to provide you with the best level of service. For example, cookies ensure that you do not need to re-enter your details every time you visit our Site.</p>
      <p>You can erase or block cookies from your computer if you want to (your help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but certain DisplayLink services may not work correctly if you set your browser not to accept cookies.</p>
      <p><strong>Disclosing your information to others</strong></p>
      <p>Other than the disclosures referred to in this policy, we will not disclose any personal information without your permission unless we are legally entitled or obliged to do so (for example, if required to do so by Court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime). <br>
        We will only sell your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of the assets of DisplayLink.</p>
      <p><strong>Information about products and services</strong></p>
      <p>It is very important to us that we provide you with the highest level of service. In order to help us do this, from time to time DisplayLink may send you details of products and services which we think may be of interest to you. If you are happy to be contacted in this way, we will ask you specifically for permission to do so.</p>
      <p><strong>Keeping our records accurate</strong></p>
      <p>We aim to keep our information about you as accurate as possible. If you would like to review or change the details you have supplied us with, you may do so at any time by contacting us as set out below.</p>
      <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
      <p>We have implemented technology and policies to safeguard your privacy from unauthorised access and improper use and will make reasonable efforts to update these measures as new technology becomes available.</p>
      <p><strong>Third party sites</strong></p>
      <p>We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites even if you access them using links from our Site and recommend that you check the policy of each site you visit. Even other DisplayLink group companies may have different privacy policies as they are located throughout the world.</p>
      <p>In addition, if you linked to the Site from a third party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners or operators of that third party site and recommend that you check the policy of that third party site and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.</p>
      <p><strong>Transferring your personal information outside the European Economic Area</strong></p>
      <p>As part of the services offered to you through our Site, the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). By way of example, this may happen if any of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EEA or one of our service providers is located in a country outside of the EEA. We may also share information with our group companies, (we currently have an office in the USA). These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA. If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</p>
      <p>In addition, if you use our services while you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with those services.</p>
      <p><strong>Contacting us</strong></p>
      <p>If at any time you would like to contact us with your views about our privacy practices, or with any enquiry relating to your personal information, you can do so sending an e-mail to us at personalinfo @ displaylink.com.</p>
