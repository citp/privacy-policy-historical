  * collect the available funds (amount for the service and (if the lessee has chosen) for prepayment and security fee protection) after the booking has been confirmed


  * withhold/block the lease payment on behalf of the car rental provider if an agreement has been reached between the lessee and the company


  * collect available funds in the event of price increases (for example, when a higher class car is offered) after the booking has been confirmed


  * cover, on behalf of the car rental provider, a possible no-show fee if, according to the Terms, the lessee does not arrive on time to pick up the car
