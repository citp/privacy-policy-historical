### Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.  It is our stand that we are in partnership with parents in safeguarding our children…please use this site responsibly and ensure that your minor child(ren) is (are) supervised while online. 

### Access To Correct Your Information

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by sending us an email or by logging into those areas that require membership (i.e. the forum, advertiser accounts, etc.). We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.   
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.   
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
