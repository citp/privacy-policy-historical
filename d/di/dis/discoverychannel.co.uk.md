You can contact us in relation to this privacy policy by contacting our Data Protection Officer at [DPO@discovery.com](mailto:DPO@discovery.com).

## CHILDREN

We do not and will not knowingly collect information from any unsupervised child under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of 13, you may not use the Site unless your parent or guardian has provided us with their consent for your use of this Site.

## THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

 ** _Information from your online interactions_**

We collect the following information from your interaction with the Site:

●           how you access our Site and the devices that you use to access our Site.  This includes collecting unique online identifiers such as IP address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this Site.

 ** _Information that you share with us_**

When you submit personal information to us through data entry fields on the Site, we collect the following information from you:

●           your name (if you’re entering a competition);

●           your e-mail address;

●           any email communications, including attachments, which you send to us.

 ** _Third parties or publicly available sources_**

We may receive personal data about you from various third parties as set out below:

●           technical data from the following parties:

o     analytics providers;

o     advertising networks; and

o     search information providers.

●           third parties that provide certain services to us within the Services, for example, facilitating and administering customer feedback forms, newsletter subscriptions and competitions;

●           identity and contact data from publicly availably sources.

## HOW WE STORE AND USE YOUR INFORMATION

We collect, store and use your personal data including your name, contact details and other information submitted to us and service usage data for our legitimate interests, so that we can:

·           make the Site available to you;

·           administer the services;

·            if you have entered into a competition on the Site, then we will use your contact details (such as e-mail address or postal address) to inform you if you have won a prize;

·           deal with your enquiries and requests (for example if you were to call customer services to ask for help and assistance then we would need to process your contact details); and

·           suggest similar products to you that you may be interested in and to understand which products appeal to our customers.

We do not believe that our storage and use of your personal information for these purposes will unduly prejudice your rights and freedoms.

Sometimes, our use of your personal information is for purposes which are ancillary to the provision of the Site and the services.  In those circumstances, we believe we have a legitimate interest in handling your personal information, and do not believe that this storage and use of your personal information will unduly prejudice your rights or freedoms.

The relevant circumstances are:

·           detecting and preventing fraud;

·           keeping our Site, products and IT systems secure;

·           ensuring that our own processes, procedures and systems are as efficient as possible;

·           analysing and enhancing the information that we collect;

·           determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and advertising;

·           service and account administration requirements such as where we need to contact you for reasons related to the service (for example, where we need to send you a password reminder, to notify you about updates or amendments to our Terms of Use, [Cookie Policy](https://www.discoveryuk.com/cookie-policy "Cookie Policy") or Privacy Policy);

·           to use IP addresses and device identifiers to identify the location of users and block any unauthorised users;

·           in some very limited circumstances, we will need to handle your personal information in a certain way to comply with our legal requirements; for example, if we are asked by regulatory bodies or law enforcement agencies to share the information;

·           where you have given us your consent, contacting you by e-mail with products and services which we think may interest you; and

·           where you have opted out of our marketing or objected to receiving e-mails from us, then we need to keep records of your preferences to ensure that we do not contact you if you have asked us not to.

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

 ** _Anonymous data_**

We collect anonymised details about visitors to our website for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes.  However, no single individual will be identifiable from the anonymised details we collect for these purposes.

## HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND WHO WE SHARE IT WITH

We disclose information under the following circumstances:

●  **Third-party service providers** : When we share information with third-party service companies to facilitate or to provide certain services on our behalf. This will include:

o      IT infrastructure companies that facilitate our provision of the Site and the services to you, for example;

o      IT support service providers; and

o     Other third-party service providers, for the purpose of tracking our customers’ use of the Site and the services.

These companies are authorised to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

●  **Group companies** : We may provide your personal information to our subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf to provide the Site and services to you. These parties are required to process such information based on our instructions and in accordance with this privacy policy. They do not have any independent right to share this information.

●  **Compliance with laws and legal proceedings** : When we respond to court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. When we believe in our sole discretion it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take actions against illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

●  **Merger or acquisition** : When we need to transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company.  If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified afterwards via e-mail and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

## INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

If you are located in the EU then we may transfer personal information that we collect from you to third-party data processors located in countries that are outside of the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** “) (including to the United States) or to members of our group of companies in connection with the above purposes.  Please be aware that countries which are outside the EEA may not offer the same level of data protection as the EEA, although our collection, storage and use of your personal data will continue to be governed by this privacy policy.

When transferring personal information outside the EEA, we will:

·           include the standard contractual data protection clauses approved by the European Commission for transferring personal information outside the EEA into our contracts with those third parties (these are the clauses approved under Article 46.2 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“ **GDPR** “); or

·           ensure that the country in which your personal information will be handled has been deemed “adequate” by the European Commission under Article 45 of the GDPR; or

·           (where appropriate when we are transferring your personal information to a recipient in the US) ensure that the recipient is part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to any personal data shared between Europe and the US.

You can find out further information about the rules on data transfers outside the EEA, including the mechanisms that we rely upon, on the European Commission website [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection_en).

## COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analysing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use cookies, for example, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference) and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Site may be limited.

Please read more about how we use cookies and what information is collected using cookies in our cookie policy [here](https://www.discoveryuk.com/cookie-policy "Cookie Policy").

## SECURITY

Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal information that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure.  Consequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us.

We are committed to protecting your personal information using appropriate technical and operational measures such as access controls that restrict and manage the ways in which your personal information is stored and handled.

## DATA RETENTION

We will retain information (including personal information) for as long as we need to use it for the reasons set out in this privacy policy and will delete it after that time except where we need to keep any personal information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.

In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## YOUR RIGHTS

You have certain rights in relation to your personal information. If you would like further information in relation to these or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us by e-mailing our Data Protection Officer at [DPO@discovery.com](mailto:DPO@discovery.com). You have the right to request that we:

·           provide access to any personal information we hold about you;

·           update any of your personal information which is out of date or incorrect;

·           delete any personal information which we are holding about you;

·           restrict the way that we process your personal information;

·           prevent the processing of your personal information for direct-marketing purposes;

·           provide your personal information to a third- party provider of services;

·           provide you with a copy of any personal information which we hold about you; or

·           consider any valid objections which you have to our use of your personal information.

We will consider all such requests and provide our response within a reasonable period (and in any event within any time period required by applicable law). Please note, however, that certain personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances.

If an exception applies, we will tell you this when responding to your request. We may request you to provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.
