**The bases on which we process information about you**

The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.

If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately stop processing your data.

If the basis changes then, if required by law, we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to process your information.

  * 1\. Information we process because we have a contractual obligation with you

When you register to create an account on our website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.

In order to carry out our obligations under that contract, we must process the information that you provide to us. Some of this information may be personal information.

We may use this information in order to: 

    * verify your identity for security purposes; 

    * sell products and services to you; 

    * provide you with our services; 

    * provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using them and our website. 

We process this information on the basis that there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.

Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example, to monitor our performance with respect to a particular service we provide. If we use it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be personally identifiable.

We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.

  * 2\. Information we process with your consent

Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you with more information about our business, including our products and services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.

Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies.

Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to reply.

Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a specific purpose, we do not use your information in any way that would identify you personally. We may aggregate it in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example, to monitor the performance of a particular page on our website.

We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent.

You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at gdpr@didww.com or via your personal account settings. However, if you do so, you may not be able to use our website or our services further.

  * 3\. Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests

We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.

Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:

    * whether the same objective could be achieved through other means;

    * whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm;

    * whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so.

For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of: 

    * record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business;

    * responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response;

    * protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party;

    * insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage business risk;

    * protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so.

  * 4\. Information we process because we have a legal obligation

We are subject to the law; therefore, we must process your information in order to comply with statutory obligations.

For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.

This may include your personal information.




**Retention period for personal data**

Except as otherwise mentioned in this privacy notice, we keep your personal information only for as long as required by us:

  * to provide you with the services you have requested;

  * to comply with other laws, including for the period demanded by tax authorities (this will typically be a period of 7 years);

  * to support a claim or defence in court. 




If you have not purchased or otherwise used any of our services, your personal information may be deleted by deleting your account. 

**Use of information we collect through automated systems when you visit our website**

###  C. Sharing information 

DIDWW provides cloud-based telecommunication services that make use of traditional telecom networks. In order for these service to function properly, DIDWW relies on interconnection to Communication Service Providers globally, and communications-related data is shared with and received from these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications. How these service providers handle this data is generally determined by those providers’ own policies and local regulations.

  * 1\. Third-party service providers or consultants 

We engage third-party service providers to process payments on our behalf. These providers are limited to only accessing or using this data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data. We do not store your credit card information.

  * 2\. Compliance with Legal Obligations 

We will disclose your or your end users’ personal information to a third party if (i) we are required to do so by applicable law, regulation, legal process or a government request (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), (ii) to enforce our agreements and policies, (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our services and products, (iv) to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (v) to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury. 

  * 3\. Affiliates 

We may share your personal information or your end users’ personal information with an affiliate company, such as a subsidiary of DIDWW. We and our subsidiaries will only use the information as described in this notice.

  * 4\. Aggregated or de-identified data 

We might also share data with third parties if the data has been de-identified or aggregated in a way so it cannot be used to identify you or your end users. 

  * 5\. Credit reference 

To assist in combating fraud, we share information with credit reference agencies, in so far as it relates to clients or customers who instruct their credit card issuer to cancel payment to us, without having first provided an acceptable reason to us and given us the opportunity to refund their money.




###  D. International transfer of information 

The provision of our services requires the transfer of data outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). In order to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, we may transfer, process and store your information in any country in which DIDWW or its affiliates, subsidiaries, suppliers or agents maintain facilities. Among these countries are the USA, Singapore and Germany. Information collected within the EEA may, for example, be transferred to and processed in a country outside of the EEA which may not provide the same level of protection for personal data as within the EEA. By using our Services, you consent to any such transfer of your information outside your country.

###  E. Communications and notifications 

As part of the service, we may send you messages relating to your account and the services you are using, such as invoices, payment receipts, low balance alerts, technical notifications and other issues. These messages comprise a mandatory part of the services. If you wish to stop them, you must cancel your services.
