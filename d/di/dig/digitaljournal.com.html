The following privacy policy explains more about how we protect your personal information. We do not rent, sell or share your information. By using or visiting DigitalJournal.com, you accept the terms outlined below. 

</div>
<div class="h3">
Minimum age requirement: 
</div>
<div class="p">

In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, Digital Journal, Inc. and DigitalJournal.com do not accept membership registrations from users who are under 13 years of age. By registering with Digital Journal, Inc., you represent that you are at least 13 years old.  

</div>
<div class="h3">
What personal information is collected on DigitalJournal.com?  
</div>
<div class="p">

All information collected is intended for creating and maintaining an account on www.digitaljournal.com, therefore we only collect information relevant to enhancing the user experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with the purpose for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you. 

</div>
<div class="p">

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), your operating system (such as Windows Vista or Mac OSX), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. 

</div>
<div class="p">
We also use third party advertisements on digitaljournal.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing Toronto real estate ads to someone in Toronto, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

</div>
<div class="p">
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.  However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.  This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.


</div>
<div class="p">

Information you provide us in any way, such as information you enter during registration, gives you access to use DigitalJournal.com. This includes your name, email address, city, country and date of birth. We also receive and save certain types of information on our server logs such as your browser, IP address, cookie information, the page you requested and in the event you are rating articles, comments or images, we record each vote placed. We use this to track trends, diagnose any technical issues associated with using the Website, and manage and administer the servers and website. 

</div>
<div class="p">
DigitalJournal.com also allows other users to see: Articles, blogs and images you have submitted; articles and images on which you placed a positive vote ("upvoted"); articles, images and blogs on which you have commented; the number of times your articles have been viewed by users; and information you provide for your user profile page such as an "About " section as well as your city, country, last log-in and the date on which you joined. We also show how many times you have submitted an article, how many images you have uploaded, how many times you have commented and in some cases how much you have earned to date. DigitalJournal.com may use this information for its promotional reasons in the future, but no personal information shall be included in its use. 
</div>
<div class="p">
