		<h2>DigiCert Privacy Policy</h2>

		<p class="center"><a href="https://clicktoverify.truste.com/pvr.php?page=validate&amp;url=www.digicert.com&amp;sealid=101" target="_blank"><img src="images/privacy-images/TRUSTe_CTV.gif" alt="TRUSTe - Click to Verify " width="68" height="95" border="0"></a></p>

		<p><span class="b">Introduction</span></p>

		<p>DigiCert, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers and website visitors.  As a result, DigiCert has developed this privacy policy to inform its website visitors and customers about DigiCert's practices regarding data collection and use.</p>

		<p><span class="b">Non-Personal Information</span></p>

		<p>DigiCert, like most website operators, uses cookies and web beacons to automatically gather, analyze, and store non-personal information about website visitors.  Non-personal information may include the visitor's IP address, browser type, ISP, referring page, operating system, date/time, and clickstream data.  DigiCert uses third-party software to assist in collecting and analyzing this information.  This information is used to improve DigiCert's service and enhance the experience of DigiCert's website visitors.  Automatically collected non-personal information is not linked to personally identifiable information. Visit our <a href="http://www.digicert.com/digicert-cookie-policy.htm">Online Cookies and Privacy</a> page for a list of cookies used on the DigiCert website.</p>

		<p><span class="b">Personal Information</span></p>

		<p>In order to provide quality communication, DigiCert collects the name, organization, and email address of website visitors who voluntarily submit that information to download software or to submit sales or technical support questions.  DigiCert also collects and stores personal information about its customers in order to provide requested products and services.  This information is voluntarily submitted by the customer or is obtained from third party databases.</p>

		<p>Regardless of the source, DigiCert protects personal information as confidential information except where the information is embedded in an issued digital certificate.  This information is necessary for the digital certificate's operation and is considered public information.  DigiCert's certificate profiles, available through DigiCert's online repository at <a href="http://www.digicert.com/ssl-cps-repository.htm">http://www.digicert.com/ssl-cps-repository.htm</a>, list the information embedded in each certificate type.</p>

		<p><span class="b">Updating Personal Information</span></p>

		<p>Generally, a customer can review and update personal information through its DigiCert account interface by clicking edit under the Account Profile tab.  Alternatively, customers may  make request changes to personal information by sending an email to <a href="mailto:admin@digicert.com">admin@digicert.com</a> or by mailing DigiCert at the address listed in this policy.  Emailed and mailed requests are subject to DigiCert's satisfaction about the authenticity of the request.</p>

		<p>Personal information embedded in a digital certificate cannot be directly edited.  Customers wishing to update personal information in a digital certificate must submit a change request through the customer account.  DigiCert may require that the updated information be verified for accuracy prior to accepting the change request.  In addition, even if information is updated in DigiCert's databases, the information will generally not be updated in the issued digital certificate.  If information embedded in a digital certificate needs updating, DigiCert may require revocation of the digital certificate.</p>

		<p><span class="b">Use of Information</span></p>

		<p><span class="b">Products and Services</span></p>

		<p>DigiCert may use personal information to market, sell and provide its products and services, including using the information to validate the identity of the customer or to contact the customer in order to discuss support, renewal, and the purchase of products and services.</p>

		<p>DigiCert may allow its business partners to assist in providing requested products and services.  All DigiCert business partners are required to keep personal information confidential and are only allowed to use the information to the extent necessary to provide the requested products and services.</p>

		<p><span class="b">Live Chat Sales/Support</span></p>

		<p>DigiCert utilizes a live chat tool for assisting our customers with sales questions and technical support needs; in addition to the customer's name and email address (for purposes of communication), this tool collects information in accordance with "Information automatically collected by DigiCert Sites" above.</p>

		<p><span class="b">Emails</span></p>

		<p>DigiCert may send out promotional emails (such as a newsletter) to individuals who provide personal information and have not opted-out of DigiCert's mailing list.  These emails may include beacons that communicate information about the email back to DigiCert.  This communication allows DigiCert to gauge the effectiveness of its advertising and marketing campaigns.  Recipients may opt-out of receiving promotional communication from DigiCert by following the instructions provided in each promotional email or by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@digicert.com">privacy@digicert.com</a>.</p>

		<p>DigiCert also sends out advisory emails.  Advisory emails are related to the primary purpose for which the information was collected and are used to respond to inquiries, provide support and validation services, provide upgrade information and security updates, and inform the customer about ordered products and services.  Because advisory emails contain essential information related to the use and security of DigiCert's products and services, customers may not unsubscribe from advisory emails.</p>

		<p>DigiCert may use third parties, with which it has a confidentiality agreement, to send promotional or advisory emails.  However, DigiCert restricts its partners from sending spam associated with DigiCert's site, brand, or products.  If you receive an unsolicited email related to DigiCert's products and services, please forward the entire message and headers to <a href="mailto:legal@digicert.com">legal@digicert.com</a>.</p>

		<p><span class="b">Third Parties</span></p>

		<p>DigiCert never sells personal information to third parties.  DigiCert may provide personal information to third parties (such as web host provider or affiliated party) if the information owner consents to the distribution.</p>
		<p>DigiCert uses a third party to process credit card payments and may provide credit card numbers and identifying financial data directly to the third party credit card processor.  These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.  DigiCert does not permanently store any provided credit card information.</p>
		<p>DigiCert also uses a third party to provide its chat-based support.  The support software allows users to input information, including an email address, to request support and clarify their problem.  The software provider does not share inputted information with anyone other than DigiCert.</p>
		<p>DigiCert may disclose information when required by law or when disclosure is necessary to protect DigiCert's rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</p>

		<p><span class="b">Security</span></p>

		<p>The security of personal information is of the utmost importance to DigiCert.  DigiCert only transmits personal information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.digicert.com/ssl.htm">http://www.digicert.com/ssl.htm</a>.</p>

		<p>DigiCert follows generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information during transmission and storage.  Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.  While DigiCert strives to use commercially acceptable standards to protect personal information, DigiCert cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

		<p><span class="b">Safe Harbor Compliance</span></p>

		<p>DigiCert complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, including
			the Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Access, Security, Data Integrity, and Enforcement and the Frequently Asked Questions (the “Safe
			Harbor Frameworks”). DigiCert is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission of the United States, and our failure to comply with this
			Privacy Policy or the Safe Harbor Frameworks is actionable under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</p>

		<p><span class="b">TRUSTe Licensee Statement</span></p>

		<p>DigiCert, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting disclosure and informed consent.  TRUSTe issues its site seal to participants who undergo a compliance review of their privacy policy.</p>

		<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact DigiCert at <a href="mailto:privacy@digicert.com">privacy@digicert.com</a>.  If you do not receive acknowledgement of inquiry or if your inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed, please contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>.  TRUSTe will act as a liaison between you and DigiCert in resolving the issue.</p>

		<p><span class="b">Applicability</span></p>

		<p>This privacy policy is supplemental to any agreement that exists between a customer and DigiCert and does not alter any agreed upon terms.  In case of a conflict, the terms agreed to by DigiCert and the customer take precedence over this privacy policy.  In addition, this privacy policy does not apply to any downloadable software provided through DigiCert's websites.</p>

		<p>Third party sites may link to or from DigiCert websites.  DigiCert is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other websites.</p>

		<p><span class="b">Amendments</span></p>

		<p>DigiCert may modify its privacy policy and related practices at any time.  DigiCert will notify interested parties of material changes by either posting a notice on its home page or by emailing affected individuals.    Visitors and customers should check the DigiCert website regularly to be aware of changes.  Revisions to the privacy policy are effective 30 calendar days after being posted (for posted notices) or 14 days after the notice is sent (for email notice).</p>
