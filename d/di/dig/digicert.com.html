</p><p><span class="orgmaintext">Information automatically collected by DigiCert Sites</span><br>
              As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically
                and store it in log files on our servers. This information includes
                internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
                provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
                stamp, and clickstream data. Such information is used to better
                understand how visitors navigate through our Sites, to enhance
                your experience while using our Sites, and to make the materials
                as valuable to visitors as possible. We do not link this information
          to personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p>Note: In addition we may
                  from time-to-time utilize a third-party tracking service to
            assist in the collection and analysis of such
                data/information. Cookies are used to track non-personally identifiable
                information about our visitors, similar to the information collected
            and stored in our server log files.</p>
          <p><span class="orgmaintext">Live Chat Sales/Support</span><br>
        DigiCert utilizes an internal live chat tool for assisting our customers with sales
		questions and technical support needs; in addition to the customer's
		name and email address (for purposes of communication), this tool collects information
		in accordance with "Information automatically collected by DigiCert Sites" above.</p>
          <p><span class="orgmaintext">Agents</span><br>
            We use an outside payment gateway and credit card processing company
              to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain,
              share, store or use personally identifiable information for any
          other purposes.</p>
          <p><span class="orgmaintext">Financial Information</span><br>
            digicert.com does not permanently store credit card information on
            its servers. All credit card numbers and identifying financial data
            are passed directly to the site where credit card orders are processed
          for all digicert.com customers.</p>
          <p><span class="orgmaintext">Organizational/Personal Information</span><br>
            digicert.com requires organizational and contact information as part
            of the SSL Application process. Information collected (i.e. organization
            name, physical address, email address, contact name, job title) will
            be used for the following purposes; to provide requested ssl certificate
            services, send a newsletter, to communicate with you regarding your
            account, provide support, and to verify your organizations and/or
            individual identity. This information is held confidential, and not
          resold or distributed to third parties.</p>
          <p><span class="orgmaintext">Editing Organizational/Personal Information (Third Party Verification)</span><br>
            DigiCert provides direct access to your personally identifiable
              information, through your DigiCert customer web-pki account. Certain
              information
            (i.e. organization name, organization address, contact name) cannot
          be directly edited, due to the nature of ssl certification.</p>
          <p>If ssl
              order and/or account details have changed, DigiCert will require
            that you submit a change request. We provide a change request tool
            inside your DigiCert account. After a change request is submitted
            and received by DigiCert we verify this information through third
            party sources (i.e. State business registration sites, D&amp;B,
            whois domain registrars) and if successfully verified (meaning the
            third party information matches the change request) the request is
          approved and our database is updated.</p>
          <p>In the unlikely event that you
            could not log into your account (gain access) to submit a change
            request, you would alternatively contact
            us by sending an email to admin@digicert.com or by mailing a written
          request to the following address:</p>
          <p>DigiCert, Inc.<br>
            333 South 520 West<br>
          Lindon, Utah 84042</p>
          <p><span class="orgmaintext">Sub-User Creation &amp; Account Access</span><br>
            DigiCert provides a tool for its primary customer account holders,
            so that they can create sub-users to assist in managing pki functions.
            The primary account holder can create multiple sub-users, to which
            personal information is entered (i.e. name, email address, job title,
            username, and password). The information collected is used to assign
            account access, permissions, and for contact purposes (i.e. technical
            issues). Sub-users may also be enrolled to receive DigiCert informational/promotional
          materials (i.e. DigiCert newsletter).</p>
          <p>Note: If a sub-user to an account
              wishes to change his or her details or to be removed from an account,
              this must first be requested of
            the primary account user within their organization, and alternatively
          direct to DigiCert by email request to admin@digicert.com.</p>
          <p><span class="orgmaintext">Order Validation Process</span><br>
            Validation is an essential step in your purchase from DigiCert. In
            order to ascertain that all SSL Certificates are sold to legally
            qualified entities, your organization or personal entity must be
            validated by our staff. DigiCert will verify such information in
            part by using third parties (i.e. State/Local Government registration
            web-sites, Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
          whois/domain Registrars, and phone directories)</p>
          <p><span class="orgmaintext">Security</span><br>
            The security of your personal information is important to DigiCert.
            When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number)
            on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using
            secure socket layer technology (SSL). Click here to learn more about
          SSL, follow this link http://www.digicert.com/ssl.htm.</p>
          <p>We follow
              generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information
              submitted to DigiCert, both during transmission and once
            we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
            of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while
            we strive to use commercially acceptable standards to protect your
          personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
          <p>If
            you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email
