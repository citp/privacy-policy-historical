<h2>News.me Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Digg knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared,
and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more
about our privacy policy.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of News.me, Inc. ("we"
or "us") on the collection, use and disclosure of your information
on http://www.digg.com, the Digg Reader, and the related services, features,
content or applications we offer (collectively, "Digg"). In connection
with your use of Digg, we receive information about you from various sources,
including: (i) through your Digg user account (your "Account"); (ii)
your use of Digg generally; and (iii) from third party websites and services.
When you use Digg, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation,
storage, transmission, disclosure and other uses of your information as described
in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p><b>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</b>
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal
Information") we gather when you are using or accessing Digg. This Privacy
Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business
partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not
own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, content
sources, services and applications ("Third Party Services") that you
elect to access through Digg, or to individuals that we do not manage or employ.
While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that
share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content
or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully
review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.
</p>
<p><b>What Information Is Collected by Digg?</b>
</p>
<p>The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate
Digg. In connection with certain aspects of Digg, we may request, collect and/or
display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of
information from our users.
</p>
<p><i>Sign-In Information:</i>
</p>
<p>When you create an Account or login using your Twitter, Facebook, and/or Google credentials,
you will provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your
username, password and email address. You acknowledge that this information may
be personal to you, and by creating an account with Digg and providing Personal
Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore
may not be anonymous. We may use your contact information to send you information
about our Services, including without limitation, notifications regarding the
Services and, upon your request, email digests of content shared by those that
you follow on Digg, Twitter, Facebook, and/or Google. You may unsubscribe from
these messages through your Account settings, although we regardless reserve
the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for account
recovery purposes.
</p>
<p><i>User Content and URL Information:</i>
</p>
<p>Digg allows you to provide content to Digg, such as the ability to digg and Submit
collections of content and uniform resource locators ("URLs"), written
descriptions of content or URLs, comments, text, images and video. We may also
collect and store information regarding the content in your Digg, Twitter, Facebook,
and /or Google feeds and the original URL, and associate that information with
your Account. We also collect and store (i) the time and date on which the content
was first dugg, submitted, or shared and (ii) information on the channels through
which the content was shared, e.g., to other Digg users, Twitter followers, Facebook
friends, and/or Google connections.
</p>
<p>We share certain information about you, such as your username, any avatar or image
you elect to post, your Twitter, Facebook, and/or Google username, your reading
feeds through Digg, Twitter, Facebook, Google, and other Third Party Services,
and other information you elect to make public to your followers in Digg, your
followers on Twitter, your friends on Facebook, and/or your connections on Google.
This may include Personal Information, but only to the extent that you decide
to share such information with others.
</p>
<p>We may retain content submitted by you to Digg indefinitely, even after you terminate
your Account.
</p>
<p><i>Digg Reader Information:</i>
</p>
<p>If you are a Digg Reader user, we will maintain information about the sources and
subscriptions, including RSS and other content feeds, that you choose to follow.
We will collect and store (i) all articles and posts that are part of your subscribed
feeds, (ii) data associated with those items, such as the time and date they
were published, (iii) whether and when you viewed, saved, or marked them as read,
(iv) information related to your organizational choices, such as the folders
or tags you assign to sources, and (v) information necessary to complete actions
you may choose to take with particular items, such as digging, saving, liking,
recommending, or sharing to Third Party Services. If
</p>
<p><i>Metrics and Analytics:</i>
</p>
<p>We collect information about accesses of content curated through Digg, as well as
interactions with Digg Reader. This information includes, but is not limited
to: (i) the IP address and physical location of the devices accessing the curated
content or interacting with Digg Reader; (ii) the time and date of each access
or interactions; and (iii) information about sharing of curated content or content
appearing in Digg Reader.
</p>
<p><i>Information Collected From Third Party Services:</i>
</p>
<p>Some features of Digg allow you to share your Digg curated content and Digg Reader
content through Third Party Services, as well as your content from Third Party
Services through Digg. If you choose to connect Digg to such Third Party Services,
we may collect information related to your use of those Third Party Services,
such as authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your Third Party Service
accounts. We may otherwise collect information about how you are using Digg to
interact with those connected Third Party Services. Note that Third Party Services
may have the ability to restrict the information that is provided to us.
</p>
<p><i>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</i>
</p>
<p>We automatically receive and record information from the Digg application or your
web browser when you interact with Digg, including your IP address and cookie
information. This information is used to facilitate collection of data concerning
your interaction with Digg (e.g., what content you have clicked on).
</p>
<p>Generally, Digg automatically collects usage information, such as the number and
frequency of users accessing Digg, Digg Reader, and its various streams of content.
We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but
not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data
enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals
use parts of Digg so that we can analyze and improve them.
</p>
<p><i>Information Collected Using Cookies:</i>
</p>
<p>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web
browser or application when you access a website or service. Your browser stores
cookies in a manner associated with each website or service you visit. We use
cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser or Digg application
and tell us how and when you visit and use Digg through the web or through an
application.
</p>
<p>Digg cookies also allow us to track when you have accessed content through Digg.
Each access is tracked using a unique identifier assigned to you in one or more
cookies stored by your web browser or application and associated with Digg.
</p>
<p>Digg cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine
the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information
to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that
your web browser or application has accessed content through Digg and may associate
that information with your Account if you have one.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of
cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies
on your computer or device. For example, third party websites may set their own
cookies.
</p>
<p><i>Aggregate Information:</i>
</p>
<p>We collect statistical information about how people use Digg ("Aggregate Information").
Some of this information is derived from Personal Information, such as your location
(which, in turn, can be derived from your IP address or through location based
services used by your device). This statistical information is not Personal Information
and cannot be tied back to you, your Account, your web browser or your Digg application.
</p>
<p><b>How and To Whom Is My Information Shared?</b>
</p>
<p>Digg is designed to help you share information that you or people you choose to follow
locate on the web with others. As a result, much of the information generated
through Digg is shared publicly or with third parties. All Digg content is public.
Your activity on the Digg network is public and can be distributed to anyone
that follows you. We may also distribute content and feeds through an email digest
to users who have elected to receive such email digests.
</p>
<p><i>Public Digg Activity Information:</i>
</p>
<p>Some of your activity on and through Digg is public by default. This includes, but
is not limited to, URLs that you have "dugg" or URLs submitted to Digg. Individuals
reading this information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities
without our control and without your knowledge. Therefore, we urge you to think
carefully about these actions.
</p>
<p><i>Information You Elect to Share:</i>
</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, you should also review the terms of
service and privacy policies of any Third Party Services that you access through
Digg. Digg respects the privacy settings/policies that you have selected with
Third Party Services, and only shares information consistent with those privacy
settings and policies.
</p>
<p>You may otherwise access Third Party Services through Digg, for example by accessing
curated content. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices
of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding
those privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected
on or through Digg.
</p>
<p><i>User Profile Information:</i>
</p>
<p>User profile information including your username, avatars or images you elect to
upload and other information you enter may be displayed to other users to facilitate
user interaction within Digg. We will not directly reveal users' email addresses
to other users.
</p>
<p><i>Aggregate Information:</i>
</p>
<p>We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons
with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that
our partners can understand how and how often people use Digg and their services
or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how we interface
with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated
or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently
developed or acquired.
</p>
<p><i>Information Shared with Our Agents:</i>
</p>
<p>We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks
on our behalf and who are under our control (our "Agents"). We may
need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide products
or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any
right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond
what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal
Information with our Agents.
</p>
<p><i>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:</i>
</p>
<p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions,
user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover,
if we, or substantially all of our assets associated with Digg, were acquired,
or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user
information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third
party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of
us may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
</p>
<p><i>Information Disclosed for the Protection of Us and Others:</i>
</p>
<p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information
as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation,
legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Service, including
investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise
address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests,
or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This
includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud
protection and spam prevention.
</p>
<p><i>Information We Share With Your Consent:</i>
</p>
<p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may
be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this
information.
</p>
<p><i>Email Communications:</i>
</p>
<p>If you sign up for The Daily Digg email via the Digg website or in any other Digg
application, you will receive an email once daily highlighting some curated or
other content on Digg.
</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you decide to receive The Daily Digg, as part of Digg, you
may occasionally receive from us email and other communication relating to your
Account. These emails will only be sent for important purposes, such as password
recovery.
</p>
<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation
to improve email deliverability or our customer service.

</p>
<p><b>Is Information About Me Secure?</b>
</p>
<p>Your Account information (including your Twitter, Facebook, Google or other third-party
logins) is protected for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized
access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your
password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing
off after you have finished accessing your account.
</p>
<p>We endeavor to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however,
we cannot guarantee the security of any Account information. Unauthorized entry
or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security
of user information at any time.
</p>
<p>We otherwise store all of our information, including your IP address information,
using industry-standard security techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that
such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you we
store, Personal Information or otherwise.
</p>
<p><b>What Information of Mine Can I Access?</b>
</p>
<p>You can access information associated with your Account by logging into the web version
of Digg, or through the Digg application. You can adjust settings and privacy
preferences through your Account settings.
</p>
<p>Registered and unregistered users can access all of the above information.
</p>
<p><b>How Can I Delete My Account?</b>
</p>
<p>Should you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by visiting digg.com/settings
or by visiting Account Settings in the Digg mobile application. If you terminate
and delete your Account, any association between your Account and information
stored by, or in connection with, Digg will no longer be accessible. However,
given the nature of sharing using Digg, any public activity on your Account prior
to deletion will remain stored on our servers and will remain accessible to the
public. If you would like us to remove such stored information, please send us
an email at support@digg.com.
</p>
<p><b>What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?</b>
</p>
<p>As stated previously, you can opt not to disclose certain information to us, even
though it may be needed to take advantage of some Digg features.
</p>
<p>You can delete your Account or adjust your Account's privacy settings. Please note
that we will need to verify that you have the authority to delete the Account,
and activity generated prior to deletion will remain stored by us and may be
publicly accessible.
</p>
<p><b>What Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?</b>
</p>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect
now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is
used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify
you by posting an announcement on or within Digg or sending you an email. A user
is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses Digg after
such changes have been first posted.
</p>
<p><b>What If I Have Questions or Concerns?</b>
</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using Digg, please send us
a detailed message to: support@digg.com. We will make every effort to resolve
your concerns.
