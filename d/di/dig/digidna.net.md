## _1\. Commitment and General Principles_

We ([DigiDNA LLC](https://www.zefix.ch/en/search/entity/list/firm/916184?name=digidna&searchType=exact)) commit to comply with the laws of Switzerland, in particular the [Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection](https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19920153/index.html) (FADP), as well as to thoroughly observe the highest standards on data protection.

**Our apps are built to empower our users by giving them broad access to their own data. We do not access, nor have access to, any user data handled by our apps: files are stored on our users' storage devices, and are never uploaded to us or to 3rd parties.  
[Learn more about our software's security and privacy features.](https://web.archive.org/security-and-privacy)**

We only collect personal data which is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for best customer services. Moreover, we do not store or process any personal data directly, but work in collaboration with reputable 3rd party services with strong ethics which help us provide our services in a way that is respectful of our users' data and privacy (see **article 8** ).

The personal data that we do have access to is necessary for us to provide efficient customer support, license management, dispute handling (refunds), as well as timely information about the purchased product. In the main, said data includes email address, type and date of purchase, license kind and activation status, and communications with our support team. **At no point does DigiDNA access or store sensitive payment information such as credit card number or PayPal account details.**

Our staff works in compliance with the strictest standards of care and confidentiality. Processing of your personal data is carried out in full accordance with the applicable regulations.

## _2\. Purposes of data processing_

We only collect personal data for our customers’ services. This is why we collect personal data if and only if you purchase an iMazing license, open a support ticket, or actively subscribe to our newsletter.

For your needs as an individual customer, your email address is collected and used to help you manage your license, inform you of updates to the product you purchased, warn you of potential security issues, and to follow up on eventual support requests. In addition, you may also decide to actively subscribe to our newsletter services to receive additional information and offers on our products, projects and company.

For the needs of all current and prospective customers, we may use your data in a fully anonymised manner for product development prospects, internal statistics relevant to the satisfaction of our customers (such as general trends or preferences) or general improvements of our products and services or other business-relevant data traffic information. See article 6 on more information.

## _3\. User management and right to information_

Upon request, you may - at any given time - be granted access to your personal data, in particular to view, update or delete it (Art. 8 DPA). In order to do so, please send us your request electronically via <https://imazing.com/contact>, or by postal mail at **DigiDNA LLC, rue Gourgas 3, 1205 Geneva, Switzerland.**

Each email sent by DigiDNA to you contains an “ _Unsubscribe_ ” button; you may nonetheless decide at any given time to unsubscribe from our mailing list by clicking [here](http://digidna.us4.list-manage1.com/unsubscribe?u=9820780b9ca506ece36277a8c&amp;id=112355e150).

## _4\. Nondisclosure of information_

If not otherwise required by law or legal injunctions, we share personal data with no other 3rd party than the partners set out below (article 8) and for no other purposes than these set out above (article 2).

## _5\. Safety & confidentiality_

## _7\. Newsletter Policy_

When you acquire a license for one of our products, you are automatically subscribed to our mailing list and we will keep you informed of important updates to the product you acquired. We operate in Apple's ever shifting environment, and for us to communicate with our users about new features or the loss of a feature following an iOS, iTunes, macOS or Windows update is crucial. We will of course also inform you of any security issues by the same channel. These communications are very infrequent - we won't swamp your inbox, promised!

You can of course unsubscribe at any time: every email we send contains an _Unsubscribe_ button, or you can [unsubscribe by clicking here.](http://digidna.us4.list-manage1.com/unsubscribe?u=9820780b9ca506ece36277a8c&amp;id=112355e150)

Additionally, we offer an optional stricly opt-in subscription to our DigiDNA Deals newsletter: deals and offers on our own products only, and only very occasionally. We sometimes have great offers for your friends to get our products at an unbeatable price, or for you to upgrade at better than standard conditions. What's not to like?

We never, EVER share your email for 3rd party marketing purposes. That would be silly, and illegal.

All our mailings are done with the help of Mailchimp, [here is their Privacy Policy.](http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/)
