# Privacy Policy | Digital Passport

**DIGITAL PASSPORT PRIVACY POLICY ******

Effective Date: August 08, 2016

Common Sense Media’s Digital Passport website and mobile applications collect personal information from educators. They do not collect personal information directly from children. For all versions except the kids version, which is described in the following paragraph, educators upload information about their students, which our services use to generate logins for the students if the educator has not created logins. Only the educator who entered the information for a student can view the information of that student. Digital Passport does not collect personal information from any other third parties, including parents, as these services are intended for use only by educators and their students. 

**As of April 2017, we are no longer offering or updating the Digital Passport App. Please continue to enjoy Digital Passport at[https://www.digitalpassport.org](https://www.digitalpassport.org/) and contact us with any questions at privacy@commonsense.org.**

**I. Digital Passport**

Welcome! Below you will find the privacy policy for Digital Passport. We are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information we obtain from you with care and respect. This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) is designed to answer your questions regarding how we collect, protect, use and share information obtained through the Digital Passport website at [www.digitalpassport.org](http://www.digitalpassport.org/ "www.digitalpassport.org") and the Digital Passport mobile application (collectively, the “Services”). There are two mobile applications, the first is a classroom version that functions like our website. The non-classroom kids version does not require a login and does not collect any personal information from an educator or student. In addition, our website may be accessed via Clever login, in which case Clever’s policies and terms may apply in addition to ours. Using Clever to login does not affect the functioning of our website. We hope this information increases your confidence in Common Sense Media and Digital Passport and enhances your experience on our Services.

Please see our separate [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use), which governs the use of the Services. We encourage you to read this Policy before using the Services, and not to use the Services if you disagree with any part of this Policy. By using the Services or in registering as an educator user, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Policy.

From time to time, this Policy may be changed. The effective date appearing at the top of this page indicates when the latest changes were made to this Policy, and your use of the Services on or after such effective date constitutes your acceptance of the Policy then in effect.

The Services are controlled and operated by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization in the United States, and are not intended to subject Common Sense Media or any affiliated entity to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. We may limit the availability of the Services, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time in our sole discretion.

**II. What Information Do We Collect?**

In this Policy, when we use the term “Personal Information,” we mean any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as the individual’s name, address, email address or telephone number.

Digital Passport collects Personal Information from educators when they sign up to join our site. This includes data such as name, email address, school information, and school affiliation.

**Children’s Information**. Digital Passport does not collect Personal Information directly from children. Educators upload information about their students, including grade levels, first name, last name, user name, password (or our website can generate username and password), and optional unique ID. Educators and schools are responsible for making sure they have any necessary permission from the students’ parents or guardians to share students’ Personal Information with us and for children to use Digital Passport. Digital Passport allows educators and students to store records as part of the functioning of the system. The records remain the property of the student, educator, and/or school. Parents should contact their schools and their educators and refer to school policies to learn about about how student information is handled. This Policy does not apply to how schools collect, use or share student information. 

**Information Collected Through Technology**. We may collect certain information automatically when you use the Services, such as the browser you are using, the internet address from which you linked to the Services, the operating system of your computer (e.g., Microsoft Windows), the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Services and usage and browsing habits on Digital Passport. We use this information to administer and improve your experience on our Services, to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential server malfunctions, and to gather broad demographic information.  
To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Services use “cookies.” These cookies are small data files stored on your computer which identify you as a previous visitor to the Services. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. You can instruct your browser not to accept cookies. However, if you disable this function, you may not be able to use some of the features on our Site.

**Non-Personal Information**. Non-Personal Information is aggregated information, demographic information and other information that does not reveal a person’s specific identity. We may collect Non-Personal Information (e.g., school location, zip codes, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us. Such information constitutes Non-Personal Information because, unless combined with your name or other Personal Information, it does not personally identify you or any other user. 

Additionally, we may aggregate Personal Information in such a manner that the end product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services. For example, we might use Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who are in schools with a particular zip code.

**II. How Do We Use This Information?**

We use Personal Information to process requests made through our Services and to operate the Digital Passport Services. We additionally use Educator Personal Information to process requests, such as a request for our e-newsletter. Educators may opt-out of receiving our e-newsletters at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of all newsletters or by visiting commonsense.org/contact and sending this request using our online form. 

**Fulfillment of Requests.** We may use Personal Information about educators or students to fulfill the purpose for which such information was provided (e.g., to help an educator manage a set of students using the Services) and provide related customer service.

**Internal Operations and Analysis.** We may use PersonalInformation for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits and so forth. 

**Additional Communications.** If you are an Educator and register to become a user of our Services or sign up to receive one of our e-newsletters, we may use the Personal Information submitted to contact you with surveys or important communications regarding Common Sense Media.

**Use of Student Information.** We use student information to permit only the educator who entered the information relating to a particular student to view that information. Educators can use this feature to track their students’ progress on the Digital Passport system. We never share individual student information with anyone other than the educator who entered that data. We may use and share aggregate student information, such as how many students have earned badges within Digital Passport for any purpose. Employees and service providers> of Common Sense Media are permitted to access student information solely for operational purposes, including, for example, troubleshooting issues with the Services.

**Use of Technology-Derived Information.** We use information collected via cookies and other technologies for purposes of Site authentication. We may also use this information to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential server malfunctions and to gather broad demographic information.

**Use of Non-Personal Information.** Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use or disclose such information for any purpose. For instance, we may compile and share aggregate data about the ages, school locations or other demographics of our users, provided that this information does not personally identify any of these users.

**IV. How We Share Information Collected On The Site**

We do not sell or knowingly divulge ANY Personal Information that we receive about students to any third parties that are not our service providers, unless required to comply with applicable laws, to comply with a court order or subpoena, to enforce our Terms of Use, or to protect the safety and security of our users and our Site. 

**Educators’ and Students’ Information.** We may share aggregated educators’ data with their school districts and with state or federal departments of education under certain circumstances, such as to demonstrate the number of student accounts initiated or digital passports issued. We may also share data provided by teachers and generated by their students (e.g., performance data derived from the use of Site features), but only in aggregate form, with financial supporters of Digital Passport or Common Sense Media, with academic or other researchers and with news media. 

**Service Providers.** We work with affiliates and third parties who provide services such as data analysis, donation processing, infrastructure provision, information technology services, email delivery services, market research and other similar services. We may share students’ and educators’ Personal Information with such third parties solely for the purpose of enabling them to provide these services to us.  
**Aggregated Information.** We may share aggregated information collected via cookies or other technologies with any vendors contracted to maintain the Services. Aggregatedinformation also may be shared with our Board of Directors, funders and partners for various reasons, such as understanding how to increase the effectiveness of our services and the traffic and trends occurring on the Site.  
**Law Enforcement; Emergencies; Compliance.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose educators’ or students’ Personal Information to others as we believe to be appropriate, and consistent with applicable law: (a) as required by applicable law, (b) to comply with legal process, (c) to respond to governmental requests, (d) to enforce our Terms of Use, (e) to protect our operations, (f) for assistance in fraud detection and prevention, (g) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Common Sense Media, you, students or others, (h) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain, and (i) in connection with a disposition of all or a substantial portion of our business, assets or stock, such as a sale, merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, assignment or bankruptcy or similar proceedings.

**V. Children’s Online Privacy**

The Services are not intended to be accessed by children under 13 except as part of the educational experience for which the Services were developed. In any event, children under 13 are not encouraged or allowed to register or to provide information to the Services independently from what is furnished by an educator who has registered with the Services, as described above in this Policy. For the kids version, no registration is needed and no information is collected by us.  
Child users cannot submit requests on the site. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected Personal Information online from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.
