## Privacy

### What information do we collect?

We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:

(a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website including your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views;

(b) information relating to any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website;

(c) information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us;

(d) information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our website services, email notifications and/or newsletters;

(e) any other information that you choose to send to us.

### Cookies

We use cookies in order to make the website work more efficiently.  Most browsers allow control of cookies through the browser settings.  However, please be aware that this may impact negatively on your use of this and other sites.

A cookie is a small text file written to your hard drive that contains information about your account on this Website. Cookies do not contain any personal information about users. During the course of your visit to this Website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Cookies enable us to collect useful information such as the device a user is using and whether they have visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

### **How does diginomica use cookies**

Information gathered from cookies helps us to analyse the behaviour of our visitors and their online behaviour and patterns. This allows us to provide you with a better community and user experience by tailoring our site to your needs. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our online community and information from cookies is critical for this.

Cookies do not give us any personal information about you or your business. They simply allow us to see which areas of the site are working well i.e. visited most and which content is most of interest.

Cookies also allow you to have a more seamless experience of using the site i.e. you remain logged in for entire sessions or multiple user sessions, removing the need to remember usernames and passwords on a regular basis. Our session cookies are therefore essential to the functionality and usability of our site.

### **Third party cookies on diginomica pages**

During any visit to this Website you may notice some cookies that are not related to diginomica. These may include 3rd party advertising cookies.

You may be served a 3rd party cookie directly from one of our partners. However, 3rd party cookies only gather anonymous information. The 3rd party cookies that our partners serve simply allows ads to be shown that may be relevant to you based on previous pages and content you have viewed.

3rd party cookies will come from (among others) Doubleclick, Atlas, Yieldmanager, Google DFP, Audience Science (revsci.net).

Any widgets we use like Google+, Twitter, FB, Linkedin may also set their own cookies and set their own Google analytics cookies.

You should check the third party websites for more information about these.

### Diginomica and Google

Diginomica prides itself on the fact it carries no advertising inventory, including Google Ads. However, we do use Google Analytics for the purpose of better understanding how people use our website and where their interests lay. We also use Google Analytics in conjunction with our email newsletter system – again to track how our email newsletters are used. The statistics we gather are only used for internal reporting purposes and provide data in aggregate about visitor behaviors. No personal information is collected or provided to us except for aggregated demographic data which is collected through Google’s identification algorithms.

However, as a media organization, we are aware that Google has not been exemplary in the manner in which it has approached GDPR. It has for example drawn important criticism from major media groups. A key story on this can be found [here](http://whatsnewinpublishing.com/2018/05/02/four-publishing-trade-groups-criticise-googles-ad-policy-change-letter-ceo/?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=What%27s%20New%20in%20Publishing).

While we don’t anticipate any impact from the concerns raised by others, we continue to monitor the situation. Should you prefer that Google Analytics does not track your behavior or only tracks certain kinds of activity we recommend reading [this page](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2790761?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) where you can find links to make changes in your browser. You should consider making changes consistent across all devices through which you access our website.

However, please see below about the use of cookies (of which Google makes extensive use) and the potential impact on performance.

**Update 8th May 2018**. Google asks us to confirm the time period over which we want retention of Google collected data. We have asked that from 25th May 2018, Google never automatically deletes data. The reason is so that we can get a better understanding of growth and aggregated profiles since our inception in a one time snapshot. Once that is complete, we will then use that information to determine the maximum amount of time over which it makes sense for Google to hold data for our analytical purposes. Once that is done then we will revise this page again. The change in Google’s data retention permission requirement goes into effect on 25th May, 2018. You can see the data retention advisory [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7667196).

### **How to reject cookies?**

If you wish to restrict or block the cookies which are set by us, you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how. For information on how to do this on the browser of your mobile phone you should refer to your handset manual.

**Please be aware that restricting cookies will have an impact on the functionality of this website and the quality of your user experience.**
