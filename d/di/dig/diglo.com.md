# Diglo privacy policy

Your privacy is our top concern. We work hard to earn and keep your trust, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:

  * We do not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes.
  * We do not share your contact information with another User without your consent.
  * Any personally identifiable information that you provide will be secured with industry standard protocols and technology.



We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of the personal and other information we receive from Users of the Diglo Site. 

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will handle your information in accordance with the version that was in place when you submitted it. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on the home page of the Site. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use. By continuing to use the Diglo service after notice of changes have been sent to you or published on the Diglo Site, you are consenting to the changes. 

The purpose of the Diglo Site is to provide its Users with an infrastructure which enables the Users to save any files on Internet servers and to permit Users to voluntarily provide information about themselves for the purposes of creating, developing, maintaining and enhancing a network of friends. You willingly provide us certain personal information, which we collect in order to allow you to benefit from the Diglo Site. If you have any hesitation about providing such information to us and/or having such information displayed on the Diglo Site or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, you should not become a User of Diglo. 

The Diglo Site and Third Party Sites 

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Diglo Site. The Site may contain links to third party Sites that are not owned or controlled by Diglo. Diglo has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party Site. You agree that you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the privacy policies (if any) of any third party Sites you may access through this Site. By using this Site, you release Diglo from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party Site to which this Site may be linked. 

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve the Service, the Site and the related features and content, to administer your subscription and to enable Users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. Below are the types and categories of information that we collect. 

Personal Information Collected 

We collect your personal information in the following ways: 

Registration 

In order to become a User, you must first create an account on our Site. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information, which you recognize and expressly acknowledge is personal information allowing others, including Diglo, to identify you: email address, User name and a password chosen by you. 

Profile Information 

Once you become a User, you may provide additional information in the “Profile” section. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration to become a User is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself. Any information you provide at registration or in the “Profile” section that is not personally identifiable may be used in the same manner and extent to which other information that is not personally identifiable is permitted to be used hereunder, including for the purpose of serving advertisements through the service. 

Contacts Information 

In order to invite others to connect with you directly in Diglo, you may use the Diglo services to invite them if they are a User, or enter their names and email addresses. This information will be used by Diglo to send your invitation including a message that you write. The names and email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders. 

You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts into the private “Friends” section of the Diglo Site. All information entered there will only be viewable by you and will not be searchable by others in the Diglo network without your permission. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this Privacy Policy as cover your own information. 

Log Data 

When you visit the Site or use the Service, whether as a Diglo subscriber or a non-registered User just browsing (any of these, a "Diglo User"), our servers automatically record information about your use of the Service and your visit to the Site ("Log Data"). This Log Data includes the filename and file size of all files that you make available or download via the Service. The Log Data may also include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, what Software you were using, the web page you were visiting immediately prior to visiting our Site, pages of our Site that you visited, the time spent on those pages, information you searched for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site's technical administration, to improve our Site's functionality and User-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. We also use this information to verify that Users of the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. Because the filenames you submit are not treated as Personal Information, we recommend that you do not include any personally identifiable information in the filenames of files that you make available via the Service. 

Cookies 

Like most Sites, Diglo uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Diglo to recognize you as a User when you return to the Diglo Site using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use the Diglo Site. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on our Site. 

One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your Diglo account. The next time you visit the Diglo Site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the service. In order to access or change any of your private information or to send a message to another User, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. 

Additionally, if you log out of the Diglo Site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Diglo Site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. 

We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing User preferences and tracking User trends. In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the Diglo Site or services. Diglo does not store personally identifiable information in the cookies. 

Web Beacons 

We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. 

To deliver these ads properly, Diglo may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by Diglo so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other Sites. 

Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. 

These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other Sites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. Diglo does not provide personally identifiable information to any advertiser or any other third party. 

Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer 

Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Diglo Site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Diglo. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Diglo Service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law. 

Consent to Diglo Processing Information About You 

Certain information you provide to Diglo may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, religion or other aspects of your private life, and more generally about you. Please be aware that in providing information to Diglo for the purposes of opening your User account, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and Diglo’s Terms of Use. The supplying of all such information by you to Diglo, including all information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive. 

Uses of personal information 

Diglo is place where you can upload photos, movies, music, documents and many other files and store them in a safe way. It is a virtual disc available from every place in the world. But it is also a place which enables you to meet new people as well as communicate with your friends. The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on our Site is used to help you describe yourself to other Users. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by Diglo from Users and is exclusively owned by Diglo. This information can be utilized by Diglo in such manner as Diglo, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. 

Diglo Communications 

Diglo will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the Diglo Site or through other means available through the service, including text and other forms of messaging. If we send any communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with any such access (including text messaging charges for messages to your mobile device). Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from Diglo related to the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when another User in your network sends you an opportunity. You can change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into your “Account Settings” and amending your email notification choices. 

Sharing Information with Third Parties 

Diglo takes the privacy of Users very seriously. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide specific services or information. For instance, we use a credit card processing company to bill Users for subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information. 

We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of our Services to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on Diglo. 

Teaming with Other Organizations to Offer Combined and Other Services 

Diglo may offer our Services in connection with other sites (including updates about the Diglo Service) or may team with other online services to give you the combined results of both services or additional services and benefits. Platform Applications (as defined in the Terms of Use) can be designed by Platform Developers (as defined in the Terms of Use) or by a subset of Platform Developers with whom Diglo has more closely aligned (“Partners”). 

In the case of Partners, we do some vetting and we only work with trusted Partners. Because of Diglo’s trust in these Partners, Platform Applications or services designed by a Partner may be automatically granted permission to access account information to provide the combined services. 

For Platform Applications designed by most Platform Developers, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the Platform Developers’ respective privacy policies and User agreements, which have not necessarily been reviewed or approved by Diglo. In these cases, it will be your choice whether or not to make use of the services and whether to proceed under the Platform Developers’ terms. 

Platform Developers are required to agree to restrictions on access, storage and usage of your information. However, while we typically enter into contractual agreements and take technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such Platform Developers, we may not screen or approve Platform Developers, and we cannot and do not guarantee that all Platform Developers will abide by such restrictions and agreements. Certain actions you take through the Platform Applications will be displayed to your connections. You understand that your use of any Platform Applications is on an “as is” basis without any warranty as to the Platform Developers’ actions. 

If you, your connections, members of your network, or other Users of Diglo use any Platform Application, or if you interact with a Platform Application being used by any of them, such Platform Application may access and share certain information about you with others. Because a Platform Application can make calls on behalf of the User interacting with it to access non-public information, the level of detail accessible by the Platform Application is constrained by the same settings that govern visibility of your data to that User on Diglo. 

For example, assuming you have not already given a Platform Application permission to access your information, your nonpublic profile information should not be visible to someone using a Platform Application if it is not otherwise accessible to that person on Diglo. 

Diglo is not responsible for your use of or inability to use any Platform Applications, including the content, accuracy, or reliability of such applications and the privacy practices or other policies of Platform Developers. 

Diglo allows other companies to place advertisements on the Site. These companies use technology to deliver advertisements you see on the Site directly to your browser. In doing so, they may automatically receive your IP address. Other companies that place advertising on the Site may have the ability to use cookies and/or web beacons to collect information, including information about your usage of the Site. We do not control the processes that advertisers use to collect information. However, IP addresses, cookies and web beacons alone generally cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. Therefore, advertisers and others whose advertisements or content may appear on the Site generally will not know who you are unless you provide additional information to them, by responding to an advertisement, by entering into an agreement with them, or by some other means. 

Forums/Chats/Blogs 

If you post on the “Group” section of Diglo, or use a bulletin board, import a blog, or participate in a chat room on Diglo, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to provide there can be read, collected, or used by other Users of these forums, as well as Platform Developers and other third parties, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Diglo is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. 

Posting File Comments 

Diglo message recipients have the ability to post comments on the file download landing page. Any information you choose to provide in a comment should reflect how much you want other Users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage you to think carefully about what information about yourself you disclose in your comments. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information you choose to submit in a comment and will not treat such information as Personal Information for the purpose of this Policy. 

Communications to other Users 

Many emails you initiate through Diglo, e.g., an invitation sent to a non-User, will list your email address and name in the header of the message. Emails you initiate may also provide aggregate information about you, your network (for instance how many people are in your network) and any other information you decide – by changing your Privacy Settings associated with their account – other Users may see. 

Emailing Via a Diglo Account 

As part of the Service, Diglo subscribers may send a file to one or more recipients identified by a valid email address. The message created by a Diglo subscriber will be sent from Diglo on the Diglo subscriber's behalf to the email addresses the Diglo subscriber enters into the online form. These email addresses will be stored in the address book the Diglo subscriber creates and will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee. The recipient of a file may contact us at [support@diglo.com](mailto:support@diglo.com) to request that we remove this information from our database. 

Legal Disclaimer 

Diglo cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Diglo or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. 

Disclosures to others 

We may also disclose your personal and other information you provide, to another third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of a Diglo division or company. Any third party to which we transfer or sell Diglo’s assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us. 

Phishing 

Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Diglo. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. 

Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information 

We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information. 

International Transfer 

Your information may be transferred to "and maintained on" computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to such transfer. 

Links to Other Sites 

Our Site contains links to other web sites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's web site. The fact that we link to a web site or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party web sites. These other web sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other web sites you visit. 

Accessing and Changing Your Account Information 

You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your Diglo account including your email, and contact preferences, at any time by logging in to your account on the Diglo Site. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, Diglo may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database. We take your rights seriously and encourage you to use them if you deem this to be appropriate. You may exercise these rights by emailing us at [support@diglo.com](mailto:support@diglo.com). 

Deleting Your Account 

You can also delete your account through the Diglo Site. If you delete your Diglo account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable database. We may retain certain data contributed by you if we believe it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. In order to delet your account please visit “Delete Account” section associated with your account. 

Your Obligations 

As a User, you have certain obligations toward the other Users with whom you will be communicating. Certain of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations, and others have become commonplace in User-friendly communities of like-minded members, such as Diglo:

  * You must, at all times, respect the terms and conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights which may belong to third parties.
  * You must not download or otherwise disseminate any information which may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist or xenophobic or which may otherwise violate the purpose and spirit of Diglo and its community of Users.
  * You must not provide information to Diglo and /or other Users which you believe might be injurious or detrimental to your person.



Any violation of these guidelines may lead to the restriction, suspension or termination of your account by Diglo, as we take these principles seriously and consider them to be the basis on which our Users adhere to the Diglo Site and the services which it offers. 

Policy Toward Children 

This Site is not directed to children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [support@diglo.com](mailto:support@diglo.com). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files. 

Changes to this Privacy Policy 

Diglo may update this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without advance notice. In the event there are significant changes in the way we treat your personally identifiable information, we will display a notice on the Diglo Site or send you an email, as provided for above. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. 

If you use the Diglo Service after notice of changes have been sent to you or published on our site, you hereby provide your consent to the changed practices. 

Security 

We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable laws related to security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. 

In order to secure your personal information, access to your data on Diglo is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the Diglo web site. To protect any data you store on our servers we also regularly audit our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails and instant messaging and similar means of communication with other Users of Diglo are not encrypted and we strongly request you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. 

Diglo takes safeguarding your information very seriously. We employ generally-accepted, industry-standard administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the Personal Information submitted to us from unauthorized access, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic data storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

Data Retention Policy 

Diglo may retain your account information indefinitely, regardless of whether you have disabled your account on the Site. Diglo will retain Log Data consistent with applicable legal requirements. Generally, at a minimum, Diglo will retain the Log Data collected from you in its active, internal company databases for six months, at which point it will migrate such Log Data to its offline archival systems, where Diglo will retain the Log Data for a period of three years (together, the "Retention Period"). After the Retention Period, Diglo will purge the Log Data from its systems. In the event of an investigation by law enforcement or a response to claims or legal process, we may retain the Log Data until such investigation or process is completed, which may be longer than the Retention Period. 

How to contact us 

If you have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please email us at [support@diglo.com](mailto:support@diglo.com).
