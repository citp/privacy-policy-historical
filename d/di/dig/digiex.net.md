Last modified: 30th December 2016 **Data Collection:**

**Guest:**  
We collect no information ourselves on you. However as our site uses Google Analytics, Google Ads and Facebook Connect your viewing history may be collected by them.   
To stop this you can enable the '[Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/)' signal in your browser, disable third party cookies or use browser extensions to block tracking.

**Members:**  
Same as above for guests, plus also when registering as a member of Digiex, we collect your Email Address, Username and Password (and any other optional details you give us).

 **Data Storage:**

Members details are stored in a database on the server, as well as on offsite backups. Offsite backups are encrypted and only stored for a small period of time as needed.  
Passwords are not stored as plaintext, they are hashed and salted for security so that in the event of a data breach they are unusable.

 **Data Usage:**

We use your information solely for use on this website to allow you to login and post.   
We have no commercial interest in your personal data.
