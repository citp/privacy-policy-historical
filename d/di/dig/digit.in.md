ENGAGE WITH THE LARGEST AND MOST INFLUENTIAL COMMUNITY OF TECHNOLOGY CONSUMERS AND ENTHUSIASTS IN INDIA

Digit represents the largest community of technology consumers (buyers and users) in India. The focus of these properties and their editorial team is not merely to publish, but engage with the community. We offer access to the community through web (online), social media, micro-influencer platforms (Digit Squad), print, multimedia and on-ground events.

Digit on the Web

Digit.in (formerly known as [thinkdigit.com](http://thinkdigit.com/)) is one of the most popular technology portals in India, visited by 12.2 million visitors every month, collectively leading to about 36.3 million page views every month. The portal offers product reviews, comparisons, buying advice, opinions, industry insights, interviews, downloads and more. Our editorial team spawns discussions across our forum and social media channels to create the largest and most engaged community of technology consumers and enthusiasts in India.

DIGIT SQUAD (INDIA'S LARGEST MICRO-INFLUENCER COMMUNITY)

The 6000 strong (and rapidly growing) community, Digit Squad is an exclusive group of premier technology enthusiasts in India, who practically live and breathe all things technology. These enthusiasts are the designated "tech gurus" in their circle of friends and family, and have become the go-to people for advice on what gadgets to buy.

The members are young, educated and use technology extensively in their personal and professional lives. They are early adopters, brand specifiers and opinion leaders in their respective local community. Friends and family turn to them for advice and recommendations on technology and technology products. Surveys indicate that an average community member influences eight other people's purchase of personal technology products. In addition to the significant market the community represents directly, it influences a market worth Rs. 12,000 crore for personal tech products.

Digit in Print

Digit is India’s most read technology magazine, with a monthly readership of nearly 230,000 (Indian Readership Survey, 2011 Q2), exceeding that of several prominent business magazines and even dailies. It is sold at over 5,500 newsstands in India. It carries features about technology that touch everyday life, reviews of tech products, tips and tricks to make the most of technology and helps answers questions for technology enthusiasts. It also includes software and digital entertainment content, distributed on DVDs, that are of interest to the readers.
