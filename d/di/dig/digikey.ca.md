When you visit the Web Site, we collect some information automatically. By collecting this information we get a better understanding of your needs and preferences, what products and services we can develop to meet those needs and preferences, and how well Digi-Key’s Web Site is functioning. Some of the information we automatically collect is necessary for the proper functioning of the Web Site, such as cookies as explained below. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Statement.

**Links, Embedded Content, and Buttons** – Digi-Key may keep track of how you interact with links across our services, including our email notifications. We do this to help improve our services, provide information and advertising, and to be able to analyze aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. The Web Site may contain links to other websites, content embedded in the Web Site that comes from or relates to other websites and services, and buttons from other websites and services such as social media websites like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+. Several of these third parties may use cookies or other tracking devices to collect and track information about you across the Internet. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites or their data collection practices. You should check the privacy policies of these other websites when providing personally identifiable information or to find out what other information they collect from users, whether while on their platform or website or in relation to links, buttons, or embedded media.]

**Information From Your Computer** – Digi-Key may itself, or through our third party service providers, collect information about your computer, such as the browser, operating system, IP address, country and other geolocation data, date and time of visit, whether you are using a mobile device, referring websites, the search engine queries you used to get to the Web Site, the pages of the Web Site you visit and your activities on the Web Site such as what images, videos, or other embedded media you view, as well as the amount of time spent on the Web Site pages, and the number of pages visited. Some of this information may be collected using cookies, as further explained below. This information is used for a variety of purposes to improve the Web Site and its content, including without limitation to gather broad demographic data, identify trends and statistics, help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Web Site and its content. Digi-Key may also collect and share information between pages of the Web Site for the proper functioning of the Web Site, as well as authentication. Digi-Key may also use this information to provide you with information and advertising regarding our products and services.

**Cookies** – The Web Site may use "cookies" to provide information on your computer. Cookies are pieces of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer or device. Digi-Key may use both session and persistent cookies on our own or through our third-party service providers as described below. Cookies may save your preferences while you are at the Web Site, such as allowing for persistent login on pages that require logging in, and Digi-Key may use them to provide you with tailored information and tracking as you use the Web Site services. Cookies help Digi-Key, among other things, to determine which areas of the Web Site are popular by tracking hits to those areas, which may in turn allow Digi-Key or our third-party providers to provide you with targeted information or advertising regarding Digi-Key’s products and services. By modifying your browser preferences, you may have the choice to accept cookies, to be notified when a cookie is sent, or to reject cookies. The rejection or limitation of cookies by your browser may limit your ability to use the Web Site.

**Third-Party Service Providers** – Digi-Key may use a variety of third-party services to help provide our services, to help us understand the use of our services, provide information and provide advertising regarding the Web Site and our products and services. Third-party services providers may include, but are not limited to third party web analytics services and a variety of third party social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+. These third-party service providers may collect, store, and share information as further dictated by the privacy policies of those third parties.

Digi-Key may use services through companies such as Google and Facebook to target ads to you related to your usage of the Web Site, such as to display advertising for the Web Site, products, and services on other websites you visit based on your activities on the Web Site in the past. Google may use the data collected to track and examine the use of the Web Site, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may also use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. You may view Google’s privacy policy here: [www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy), with more information located here: [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners) (including information regarding how to control how information is shared through your Ads Settings) and here: [support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en](http://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en).

**Web Beacons** \- We may employ Web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs), which are customized links or similar technologies, on the Web Site and when sending you messages, newsletters, or promotional emails or in using third-party service providers. Web beacons allow us to (a) determine whether you have opened, or acted upon, a promotional email and which links you have clicked on to deliver to you more focused communications and other content, (b) allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain webpages and effectively deliver services, and (c) enable us to compile aggregated statistics and determine the efficacy of promotions by using Web beacons from third parties.

**Online Chat** – Your online chat login information and communications conducted via the chat feature are recorded and stored by LivePerson, a third-party Application Service Provider. Digi-Key has access to LivePerson's recorded and stored chat information and may monitor or review such information for quality assurance. Digi-Key may also use that information in accordance with Digi-Key's Privacy Statement and Web Site Terms & Conditions. The use of the information by LivePerson is subject to the LivePerson Privacy Policy that can be found at the LivePerson web site: [www.liveperson.com/policies/privacy](http://www.liveperson.com/policies/privacy).

**3\. Sharing Of Your Information**

Digi-Key may share information we collect through the Web Site, including personal information, with its product suppliers, for example, for market research and payment of commission to the supplier's agents.

Occasionally, Digi-Key may make the names and addresses of our customer list available to carefully screened companies that offer products and/or services that may be of interest to you. You may elect to opt out of this use of your mailing address by completing the "[Opt Out Form](https://www.digikey.ca/classic/forms/dkc/www/servicesoptout.aspx?FormSite=CA&FormLang=en&site=CA&lang=en)."

Digi-Key may engage third party service providers, consultants, and independent contractors to perform functions and provide services for us including without limitation database management, advertising, and email service providers. Digi-Key may share the information we collect through the Web Site with these service providers so that they can perform services for us in relation to the Web Site and Digi-Key’s business.

 **Security** – Digi-Key takes commercially reasonable steps to protect data, particularly financial information, transmitted through the Web Site. Digi-Key, however, cannot be responsible for and does not warrant the security of any information you transmit over the Internet, including using the Web Site. Digi-Key's site is equipped with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.
