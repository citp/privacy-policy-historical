# Privacy Policy - Digital Traget | Digital Traget

**Your privacy is critically important to us. At Digital Target we have a few fundamental principles:.**

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We cant stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.) We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights. We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services. This Privacy Policy is adapted from the Akismet Privacy Policy made available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license by the fine folks at Automattic Inc. Thanks guys!

**Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:**

Like most website operators, Digital Target collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Digital Target’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Digital Target’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Digital Target may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Digital Target also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Digital Target does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to Digital Target’s websites choose to interact with Digital Target in ways that require Digital Target to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Digital Target gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Digital Target does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**

Digital Target may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Digital Target may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Digital Target does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

Digital Target discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Digital Target’s behalf or to provide services available at Digital Target’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using DDigital Target’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Digital Target will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Digital Target discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Digital Target believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Digital Target, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Digital Target website and have supplied your email address, Digital Target may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whats going on with Digital Target and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Digital Target takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitors computer, and that the visitors browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Digital Target uses cookies to help Digital Target identify and track visitors, their usage of any Digital Target website, and their website access preferences. Digital Target visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Digital Target websites, with the drawback that certain features of Digital Target’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Digital Target may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at Digital Target’s sole discretion. Digital Target encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
