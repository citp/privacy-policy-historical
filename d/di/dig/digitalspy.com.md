With respect to information other than your payment information, we use that information:

  * Providing customer assistance or technical support.
  * Customising content, providing recommendations and enhancing the quality and your overall experience with the Digital Services, including by retaining your user preferences or presenting content in the most effective manner for the browser or device you use to access the Digital Services.

  * Interest-based advertising (also known as targeted or personalised advertising or ads) is advertising based on your interests as inferred from your activities over time on the Digital Services and online services operated by third parties, as well as information from other sources. Interest-based ads consist of text ads, images, animations or videos and are displayed to you based on various factors, including the context of the site or app in which they appear (e.g., sport or travel section), information you provided to the operator of the site or app (e.g., when you created an account), your activities on the site or app (e.g., pages viewed, searches performed or ads clicked), and information such as your demographic, interests and household information.

  * Cross-device linking. If you access the Digital Services from multiple browsers or devices, we, our service providers and third parties may try to establish connections among and link the different browsers and devices you use to access the Digital Services and our content or ads published elsewhere in certain circumstances.  This helps us provide you with a seamless experience across the browsers and devices you use and serve you with more relevant content and ads (e.g., so that we don’t show you the same article twice).  See our Cookies Policy for information on the steps you can take to limit cross-device linking.
  * Analysing and measuring the performance, effectiveness and reach of our advertising (including interest-based ads) and marketing efforts on the Digital Services and elsewhere.

We process personal information for different purposes on the following legal bases:

  * **To perform our** **contractual** **obligations to you.** We and our service providers process your information to perform our contractual obligations to you when we use your information to provide you with the Digital Services and related content, products or services and to communicate with you.  For example, when you purchase a subscription from us, we process your payment and contact information as necessary to confirm the subscription and we process your contact information and other details to provide you with support services you request.  We also send you informational communications on this basis, including to confirm a subscription or to notify you of a change to a Digital Service.  Failure to provide requested information could prevent or delay the fulfilment of our contractual obligations.
  * **To pursue our legitimate interests.** We process your information to meet our legitimate interests when we use your information to provide you with the Digital Services and related content, products or services, to communicate with you and for our advertising and marketing purposes.  For example, our legitimate interests include making improvements to, customizing and understanding how you interact with the Digital Services and related content, products or services, and sending you communications about products and services we think may be of interest to you.  To accomplish our legitimate interests, we may share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries, service providers and business partners (including for our advertising and marketing purposes) and in the context of a corporate transaction.  We maintain safeguards to protect the information we process to pursue our legitimate interests.
  * **To compl** **y with our legal obligations.** We process and share your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations when we use your information to protect our rights or the rights of others and when we share your information with other parties where required by law or as necessary to protect our rights.

**E. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION**

We share the information we obtain with:

  1. **Affiliates and Subsidiaries**. We work closely with affiliates and subsidiaries within the Hearst family of companies with whom we share your information as necessary or appropriate to operate the Digital Services.
  2. **Service Providers**. In connection with the operation and provision of the Digital Services, Subscription Forms and the fulfilment of orders for our products or services, we engage various third parties to provide services or handle transactions on our behalf, such as payment processing, email distribution, list processing, postal mailing, cloud computing, analytics, digital content or print subscription performance measurement, ad serving, and managing sweepstakes, competitions, promotions or events.  These service providers use the information we provide to them as necessary or appropriate for the performance of their services.

We may provide your information to advertisers, advertising agencies, ad networks, ad exchanges, marketing businesses, technology vendors and other entities that create, deliver and assess advertising or marketing campaigns, including interest-based ads.

  5. **Business Partners**. In certain circumstances we provide your information to business partners including, without limitation, joint marketing partners, content sponsors or event organizers, for various purposes.  For example, we partner with a third party to offer products on a co-branded, co-sponsored or cross-promotional basis that involves the sharing of information.  These initiatives take place on the Digital Services or on other media.  The participation of a business partner in a particular initiative is communicated to you by the inclusion of the products, services or branding of the relevant business partner.
  6. **Other Parties When Required by Law or As Necessary to Protect Our Rights**. We share your information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend our legal rights, the privacy or safety of our employees, users of the Digital Services or other individuals and entities, or to comply with or enforce applicable industry standards, law or legal process, including responding to court orders, warrants, subpoenas and other requests from public and government authorities.
  7. **Corporate Transactions**. We may transfer any of the information we have about you to proceed with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition or other disposition, or in connection with a bankruptcy reorganisation, dissolution, or liquidation.
  8. **With Your Consent or Otherwise at Your Direction**. In addition, we share your information with third parties when you consent to or request such sharing.



Because we operate as part of a global business, the recipients referred to above will sometimes be located outside the jurisdiction in which you are located (or in which we provide the Digital Services or Subscription Forms). See the section on “International Data Transfer” below for more information.

**F. YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

In certain circumstances, you have a right to access or object to the use of personal information held about you (including in relation to direct marketing).  You can also ask us to rectify, update, erase, restrict or to share your information in a usable format with another company.  Such requests are subject to applicable law.

We encourage you to contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate.

If you would like to discuss or exercise such rights, please contact us using the details provided in the “Contact Us” section below.  We will contact you if we need additional information from you in order to honour your requests.

**a. YOUR CHOICES, INCLUDING MARKETING AND INTEREST-BASED ADS OPT-OUTS**

**Direct Marketing Opt-Outs**

  1. **Email marketing.**   You can opt out of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us or third parties (where you have chosen to receive third party communications or other types of communications from us, as required by law) by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link contained in such emails.  Please keep in mind that if you opt out of receiving marketing or promotional emails, we will still send you transactional emails or other communications relating to your use of the Digital Services (e.g., to confirm your subscription, to inform you of changes to a Digital Service or in response to your password recovery request).
  2. **Text message marketing**.  If you choose to participate in a text message marketing campaign or promotion offered in connection with a Digital Service, you can opt out of receiving marketing texts from us by following the instructions contained in those messages (e.g., texting the word STOP) or provided to you when you elected to receive text message marketing.

  5. **Co-Branded, Co-Sponsored or Cross-Promotional Offerings with Business Partners**.  If you choose to participate in a co-branded, co-sponsored or cross-promotional offering, the brand, sponsor or other third-party business partner involved in that offering may use your information for its own purposes, including advertising and marketing purposes, in line with the business partner’s own privacy policy.  You must contact the relevant business partner directly to exercise your opt out choices with respect to the business partner’s use of your information.



**Interest-Based Ads Opt-Outs**

Depending on your preferences regarding the use of Cookies and Similar Technologies, ads you see on the Digital Services may be interest-based ads.  This means that these ads are customised based on the information we and others obtain about you and involve the use of Cookies and Similar Technologies.  We describe in our Cookies Policy steps you can take to limit tracking of your activities and the delivery of interest-based ads in browsers and mobile apps you use to access the Digital Services.  Please keep in mind that if you opt out of interest-based ads, you will still see ads, but these ads will not be based on your inferred interests.  In addition, if you take the steps described in the Cookies Policy, some automated means will still be used to collect information about your interactions with the Digital Services for the other purposes described in this Privacy Notice (e.g., to remember user preferences or enable specific functionality).

The technologies used to deliver ads on websites and mobile apps differ.  Please also remember that opt-outs are browser and device-specific.

**Additional Choices**

  1. **Device Settings.** For relevant Digital Services, you will be able to review and adjust your preferences by updating the settings on your device (e.g., permitting us to collect precise location information).
  2. **Push Notifications.** If push notifications for a particular Digital Service are enabled on your device, you can review and update your push notification preferences by adjusting the settings on your device.  For example, you can select the relevant app from “Notifications” (for iOS devices) or “App notifications” (for Android devices) and turn off alerts accordingly.



**G. HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE YOUR INFORMATION**

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect information from unauthorised access, use or disclosure.

We will keep your personal information for as long as we have a relationship with you. Once our relationship with you has come to an end, we will retain your personal information for a period of time that enables us to:

  * Maintain business records for analysis, understanding market trends and/or audit purposes and to improve our Digital Services.

  * Defend, establish, exercise or bring any existing or potential legal claims.

We will delete your personal information when it is no longer required for these purposes. If there is any information that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further processing or use of the data.

**H. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER**

In certain circumstances, your personal information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries outside the European Union or United Kingdom that do not have similar data protection laws to the European Union or United Kingdom.

In such circumstances we put appropriate safeguards in place to protect your data, including contractual commitments.  For more information on these safeguards, please contact us at the details below.

The Digital Services are not intended for use by children, especially those under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
