# Privacy Policy | Web Design Training courses, videos & tutorials at DigitalFamily.com

DigitalFamily.com  **(referred to as “us” or “we” or “DigitalFamily.com” or “DigitalFamily”),**  is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

Because we do gather certain types of information when you purchase goods from us or sign up for mailing lists or special features, we want you to understand the terms and conditions surrounding the gathering and use of that information. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and how our visitors can correct or change it.

This Policy discloses the privacy practices for the entire Artesian Media, Inc. network of sites, which includes DigitalFamily.com, ArtesianMedia.com, JCWarner.com, ChocolateGameRules.com, SipsFromtheFirehose.com, California Wildlife Photography site, and others, even those that are not listed here.

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [Janine@DigitalFamily.com](mailto:Janine@DigitalFamily.com) for clarification.

**What information does Digital Family gather/track?**

We collect two types of information about our site visitors: aggregated “traffic data” derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites using Google Analytics; and personal data that some visitors provide through optional, voluntary participation in our Reader’s Corner, by signing up for our email newsletter, by ordering book, videos, or other products, or through email messages sent to any of the email addresses included on any of the Artesian Media sites.

We collect traffic statistics and other information and use it to tailor our content to our users’ needs, as well as to help our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience. We sometimes share the _aggregated_ demographic information with our advertisers and partners., but we  _never_  share any information about specific individuals with any third party.

> ****DigitalFamily collects email addresses when visitors sign up for the email newsletter. We may also add your name to our mailing list when you make a purchase or send email to any of our staff or consultants. When we send out bulk email we use a third-party email service, MailChimp.

We reserve the right to use the contents of these submissions to contact users directly, on occasion, or to add you to our email newsletter mailing list, but always with an easy eay to opt-out option.
>

**How DigitalFamily uses the information it gathers/tracks**

DigitalFamily uses any information voluntarily provided by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don’t like, based on traffic to those areas. DigitalFamily does not track what each user reads, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us to continue to build a better service for you.

DigitalFamily creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because DigitalFamily doesn’t track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked on a specific ad.

**With whom does DigitalFamily share the information it gathers/tracks?**

Artesian Media uses the information described above to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience’s demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We do not share information about individual users with any third party.

The Artesian Media sites contain links to third party sites. Artesian Media is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. If you have questions about how one of our advertisers or any other site we link to, uses information about you when you click through to its site, please contact that site directly.

Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name and e-mail addresses) on any comments, bulletin boards, or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.

**What is DigitalFamily’s opt-out policy?**

DigitalFamily gives users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:

  * Opting not to receive any informational mailings when accessing any special sections of our sites, including the Readers Corner.
  * Opting not to provide certain personal information when completing an online form, subscribing to a publication, or participating in a contest.
  * Opting not to email us, order any of our products, or subscribe our newsletter, which eliminates the need for any personally identifying information from our users.
