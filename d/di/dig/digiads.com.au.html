<p class="bodyTxt">Cookies  cannot be used to retrieve data from your hard drive, obtain your email  address or obtain sensitive information about you.

<p class="bodyTxt">DIGIADS.com.au allows our ad service company to set cookies as  well. These cookies can "recognize" a consumer by a Unique identifier  assigned at the time of the first visit, and may be used to measure  site and page visits and browser version number, and browsing activity.

<p class="bodyTxt">We also place "web beacons" on the website on behalf of  third parties. A web beacon is a small, transparent image placed at  various sections of our site to monitor user traffic.
