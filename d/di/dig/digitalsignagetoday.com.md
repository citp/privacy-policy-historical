We appreciate the trust you place in us when you enter your contact info into a form on our site. We do not take that trust for granted and have implemented the following policies to protect your data and privacy.

**When you fill out a form on our site, you will be added to these lists…**

  1. **Email Newsletters** – We will deliver content from our site to your inbox several times a week. You can unsubscribe from these emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of every issue.
  2. **Special Offers** – From this list you will receive occasional email messages that we send on behalf of our advertisers and partners. We control all such mailings. You can unsubscribe from this list at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each message.



_**We do not rent or sell these email lists.**_ All email communications sent to these lists are managed by us.

**The data we collect will not be shared without your consent.**  
We only collect data about you from a professional context. This includes, but is not limited to, your email address, company name, job title, etc. We will not sell or share this data to anyone without your explicit consent.

In specific cases, we will be contractually obligated to share your data with one of our third-party advertisers, sponsors or partners (for example, webinars, downloads or events). In these instances, we will make it clear that the data you share will be transferred to the third party. _**You will always have the option to not have your data shared by not taking part in that specific program.**_

**We use third-party data processors.**  
Some information, such as IP and your email address, may be shared with the following third parties who help us run our website and email programs. They will only use this information to serve our needs and are prohibited from using it in any other instance. They are: Google Analytics (website tracking), Google Ad Manager (ad serving), Campaigner (email), ClickBack (email), RegOnline (event registration), AdDaptive Intelligence (ad serving).

Our implementation of Google Analytics includes user-id tracking which lets us associate engagement data from different devices and multiple sessions, so we can discover how users interact with our content over an extended period of time. No data that could be used to personally identify you (such as your name or email address) will be shared with Google as part of this implementation. _**If you do not want your activity on our site tracked in this way, click the button below to opt-out.**_
