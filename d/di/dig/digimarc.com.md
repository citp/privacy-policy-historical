While we use Secure Sockets Layer encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also endeavor to secure user-information off-line by limiting internal access to such information on a need to know basis. Furthermore, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, which is only accessible by specific employees of Digimarc Corporation.
