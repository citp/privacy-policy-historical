### How Long Does Digital UK Retain Personal Information For?

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested, to resolve and report on a digital television issue or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).  

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

• You have the right to **opt-out of communications** we send you at any time.  You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the e-mails we send you. 

• Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can **withdraw your consent** at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

• You have the **right to complain to a data protection authority** about our collection and use of your personal information.  Contact details for the UK Information Commissioner's Office can be found at www.ico.org.uk.

### What Security Protections Does Digital UK Have?

We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you.  The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
