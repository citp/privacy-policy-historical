Staff will still be required to collect the phone’s unique IMEI number but will not record any personal identity information in JB Hi-Fi’s system and will record the sale as “Anonymous”. Purchasing an outright phone anonymously means that, if you lose your receipt, JB Hi-Fi may not be able retrieve evidence of your proof of purchase for consumer guarantee (warranty) purposes.  Please note that you will not be able to purchase an Outright Phone “Anonymously” if you are purchasing online (including for pick-up in store).

The other provisions of this Privacy Statement also apply to the purchase of mobile phones.
