**_How We Use Personal Information_**  
We use personal information to provide you with quality services, to carry out requested transactions, and to improve our Site and our service and merchandise offerings. We may use some of the information that we collect concerning you in order to present you with information concerning services or merchandise that may be of interest, and we may share that information within our family of affiliates.

We are committed to maintaining the security of personal information. We employ reasonable security measures to secure and protect the information we receive. Please remember, though, that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. 

**_Disclosure Policy_**  
We disclose personal information as necessary to operate our business, such as in connection with providing services to you or processing your transactions.

As stated above, when you post any information or other content to an online obituary, guestbook, or memorial using our Site, such information and/or other content is viewable by the public, and the security and other protective provisions of this Privacy Policy do not apply.

Any information or other content disclosed on a non-restricted service becomes public information and may be collected and used by others without your or our knowledge. Also, please keep in mind that the posting of your user ID or alias in connection with public disclosures may result in the transmission of unsolicited messages to you from persons and entities over which we have no control. Please exercise caution and good judgment when disclosing any personal information in any non-restricted service.
