| 

####  **How we use _cookies_ and similar technologies**

  
|  9.1 |  We collect information automatically through the use of _cookies_ , web beacons (also called clear gifs or pixel tags), digital analytics network tools, and other similar technologies.  
---|---  
  |  _Cookies_  
9.2 |  A _cookie_ is a text file containing small amounts of information that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you.  
9.3 |  Our websites use _cookies_ to improve your user experience when you visit our websites and to  collect information about your user patterns and interests so that we can display to you online ads that are relevant to your interests when you return to the website. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a _cookie_ , giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off _cookies_ ; however, if you do this, some of our websites may not work properly. We also use _cookies_ and similar technologies for analytics and advertising purposes.  
9.4 |  For most types of _cookies_ , including those we use for advertising purposes, you have the right to tell us that you do not want us to use them when you visit our websites. If you opt out of _cookies_ that we use for advertising purposes, we will stop using _cookies_ , but please note that this does not mean that you will not see ads when you visit our websites, it only means that the ads that you will see will not be tailored to your interests.  
9.5 |  For more information about our use of _cookies_ and how you can opt out, please read our _Cookies_ Notice. If you want to know more about _cookies_ , check out [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).  
  |  _Pixel tags_  
9.6 |  A pixel tag, also known as a clear gif or web beacon, is an invisible tag which we may place on certain pages of our website. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. Usually, they work in conjunction with _cookies_ and record when a computer visits a page. If you turn off _cookies_ the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.  
9.7 |  A 'smart pixel' is a tiny graphics file containing a unique identifier that is embedded within an e-mail. We may use smart pixels in our email campaigns or newsletters. They allow us to track whether the e-mail was opened successfully and to record certain information about the activities of the recipient(s). Users who have set their e-mail client software to refuse automatic downloads of images within the e-mails they receive will not be served our smart pixel unless they actively choose to download the images within the e-mail (and many e-mail clients are set by default to refuse automatic image downloads).  
  |  _Digital Analytics Network Tools_  
9.8 |  We may use digital analytics network tools to process and analyse common attributes associated with your use of our websites, products and/or services. We may generate or maintain our own customer profiles using internal data sources including personal information which you provide to us, or personal information obtained from third parties associated with or in collaboration with us. We may use this information for various reasons, including to provide you with better network support services, customer support services, and also to present targeted or tailored marketing campaigns or content to you.  
  
####  **10.**

| 

####  **How long we keep your personal information for**

  
|  10.1 |  We will not keep your personal information for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which we collect and process it, except when we are required by law to keep it for longer than that or have valid grounds for doing so.  
---|---  
  
####  **11.**

| 

####  **How we protect your personal information**

  
|  11.1 |  Our appointed privacy officer's job is to ensure that the processing of your personal information will always comply with this privacy notice and applicable laws.  
---|---  
11.2 |  We have put in place appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal. Our specialist security teams review these security measures regularly, to ensure that we are in compliance with the applicable laws (including any security standards or guidelines as may be issued by the Personal Data Protection Commissioner from time to time).  
11.3 |  When we use service providers or other data processors to process personal information on our behalf, we require them to follow our instructions and apply appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect the personal information they process on our behalf, which may include the following:  
|  a. |  Obtaining the data processor's undertaking that neither itself nor its employees shall disclose personal information to any third party without our authorisation.  
---|---  
b. |  Obtaining the data processor's undertaking to deploy technical and organisational security measures, as agreed by us, as well as the obligation to inform us should any of the measures be breached.  
c. |  Obtaining the data processor's undertaking to otherwise conduct itself in such a manner so as to not cause any breach of the applicable laws.  
d. |  Requiring the data processor to return all personal information upon expiry or termination of agreement.  
e. |  Conducting an audit of the technical and organisational measures employed by the data processor, where necessary.  
11.4 |  When you log into your account to use our services with your phone number or username and password, all data is using cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. We employ such cryptographic protocols on all pages on our websites where we collect personal information. To make purchases from these web pages, you must use an TLS or SSL-enabled browser such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, or Chrome. This ensures that your personal information remains confidential and is protected while it is transmitted over the Internet.  
11.5 |  If you have a user name and password to access our services, you are responsible for keeping them secure and confidential. Where you have logged in to your account and have been inactive for some time, to keep your details secure and to protect your account from unauthorised access, we will automatically log you out of the account.  
  
####  **12.**

| 

####  **Data exports**

  
|  12.1 |  The Internet is a truly global environment. We use various local and international partners and service providers to provide certain services such as our digital service and the technical infrastructure (such as the servers) which may be located outside Malaysia.  
---|---  
12.2 |  This means that we may transfer your personal information to countries outside Malaysia for the processing of Personal Data. Such countries may not provide the same level of protection as Malaysia, so when we process personal information internationally, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal information is adequately protected. Typically, such steps include carrying out data security reviews of any recipients and putting in place contracts with such recipients, which require the recipients to ensure that personal information in that country will not be processed in a manner which, if that country is Malaysia, would be in contravention of the applicable data protection laws in Malaysia.

####  **Your rights**

We will respond to your request within an appropriate timeframe and, in any event, within any timescales and subject to payment of any fees prescribed by applicable law.  
13.3 |  In addition, you can also access most of the personal information that you provide to us via your online account at any time, to obtain a copy and to correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate. You can also close your account altogether.  
13.4 |  We will do our best to ensure that the personal information we hold about you is correct, complete and accurate. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that you provide us true, accurate and complete information, and that you keep information on your online account up to date.

####  **Information about children**

  
|  14.1 |  As a general rule, our services are not aimed at children under the age of 18, and generally we do not intentionally collect personal information about them.

---|---  
14.2 |  However, some services may be designed for use by children under the age of 18. We will let you know in these services and the applicable Terms of Service exactly how we are protecting the relevant data and will make sure each of these services complies with our guiding principles.
