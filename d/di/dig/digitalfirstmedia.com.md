Our Policy does not apply to Personal Information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, other than through our Platform, such as by phone, by mail, or through other offline and print media. This Policy does not apply to Personal Information collected about you by anyone except us and only applies to the Platform to which this Policy is linked.

Our Platform is intended for users who are located in the United States of America. Our Policy shall be interpreted under the laws of the United States.

* **Purpose**

In order to make your visits to our Platform and use of the services available on or through our Platform as worthwhile as possible, we may ask you for Personal Information and we may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit us. “Personal Information” includes, for example, your name; home address; business address; e-mail address; telephone, wireless or fax number; short message service or text message address or other wireless device address; instant messaging address; credit card and other payment information; demographic information; or other information that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual. From time to time, other Personal Information, such as your age, gender, education and subscription information may also be requested. Our Policy explains in general what Personal Information and other information is collected on our Platform, how the Personal Information is used, and with whom we may share such Personal Information.

* **What Information is Collected on Our Platform?**

  1. _User Provided Information_

We collect Personal Information from users of our Platform. Such Personal Information may be collected, for example, when you submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on our Platform, send us an e-mail, or in any other way submit information to us via our Platform.

In addition to collecting Personal Information from users such as names and contact details, we also collect Non-Personal Information. “Non-Personal Information” refers to information that may not be itself be reasonably associated with, linked to, or used to identify you. For example, non-user specific aggregated data such as information about traffic patterns on the Web Sites.

You may be able to send information about our products and services to your friends and family members through our Platform by clicking on an “E-mail to Friend” or similar button on our Platform or in an e-mail that we have sent you. In some of these cases (unless you simply forward our e-mail on your own), you may provide the name and e-mail address of your friend or family member to us. Such Personal Information will be treated in accordance with our Policy and applicable law.

You may also be able to send an online card to a friend or family member, or send them a gift or gift certificate. If so, you may be required to provide us with your friend or family member’s Personal Information. Such Personal Information will be treated in accordance with our Policy and applicable law.

  2. _Other Information We Collect_
    1. Cookies 

We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a web server when you visit it and are stored on your computer’s hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies track where you travel on our Web Site and what you look at and purchase. They may store the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and password. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Web Sites to other information about you. These purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Web Sites.  
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the internet industry. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Policy.

Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Site or certain areas or features of our Web Site.

    2. Clear GIFs 

We may use “clear GIFs” (a/k/a “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, on our Web Site and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you.

    3. IP Address and Clickstream Data 

Pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or Web Site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, our server may automatically collect data about your server’s internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol Address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service provider whenever you’re on the internet. When you request pages from our Web Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Web Site; the web site you visit after our Web Site; the ads you see; the ads you click on; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on our Web Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and internet service provider.

    4. Device Information 

We may collect certain device information. Device information may include, for example: the type of device you are using (e.g., your particular brand of phone or tablet), certain device identifiers which may be unique to your device, your Internet service provider, and depending on your permissions, content you have stored on your device (e.g. contacts stored on your phone). 

Please note that we treat the information in section 2.2 as Non-Personal Information, except when we are required to do otherwise under applicable law or if we link this Non-Personal Information with your Personal Information.



* **How is the Personal Information Used?**

We use both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for multiple purposes. Digital First Media may use Personal Information for various purposes, including without limitation, to:

  * improve the content of the Web Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Web Site for each individual user, and to notify users about updates to the Web Site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you;
  * respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings;
  * maintain our internal record keeping;

  6. _Our Right to Disclose Information Including Legally Compelled Disclosures_

We have the right, at our sole discretion, to disclose Personal Information posted on our Platform and any other information you provide us, to third parties, including law enforcement personnel and in response to a subpoena or other lawful process potentially compelling disclosure of Personal Information without an obligation to provide prior notice to you.
