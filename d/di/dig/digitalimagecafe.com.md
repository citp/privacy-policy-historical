# Digital Image Cafe: Digital Photography, Photo Contests, and More

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation of DigitalImageCafe.Com, we gather certain types of information about our users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the information.

DigitalImageCafe.Com collects two types of data from users: volunteered personal data (such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, etc.); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on DigitalImageCafe.Com).

**Personal Data**

Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to DigitalImageCafe.Com, for example in registering for membership services, in answering surveys, providing course review information, requesting information, and purchasing items from DigitalImageCafe.Com and/or any of its partners. Also, we collect the e-mail addresses of users who post messages to our message boards (forum).

**Aggregated Information**

Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, DigitalImageCafe.Com collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from DigitalImageCafe.Com, our servers log your IP address. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. DigitalImageCafe.Com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on DigitalImageCafe.Com.

**Use of Cookies**

DigitalImageCafe.Com also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow DigitalImageCafe.Com to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for example, by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the Site without reregistering. Cookies are used by DigitalImageCafe.Com to measure activity on the Site and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during membership registration or a request for information), DigitalImageCafe.Com does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to DigitalImageCafe.Com's privacy policies.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so.

**Use of Information Collected by DigitalImageCafe.Com**

DigitalImageCafe.Com uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you. DigitalImageCafe.Com will share aggregated information with third parties for both advertising and promotional purposes.

DigitalImageCafe.Com does not share your personal information with third parties without your permission.

**How to Unsubscribe from Newsletters**

If you'd rather not receive news and updates via e-mail, simply: Send a blank email with the subject line "Remove" to [webmaster@digitalimagecafe.com](mailto:webmaster@digitalimagecafe.com) , or send a letter to Customer Service, Four Elements Incorporated, 1240 Whitehall Ct, Lake Zurich, IL 60047.

**Children and Privacy**

DigitalImageCafe.Com encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. No information should be submitted to or posted on the Site by users under the age of 13 without the consent of their parent or guardian. Personal information from anyone registering on the site and reporting they are under the age of 13 is not kept in our database.

**Links to Other Sites**

It is important to note that DigitalImageCafe.Com contains links to sites other than DigitalImageCafe.Com, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as DigitalImageCafe.Com. For instance, if you click on an advertisement on DigitalImageCafe.Com, this will take you away from DigitalImageCafe.Com and to an entirely different site. This can include links from advertisers, content providers and partners who may use DigitalImageCafe.Com's logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and may collect data and make uses of it that DigitalImageCafe.Com would not.

DigitalImageCafe.Com reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence of a revised privacy policy. You can e-mail us with any further questions at [info@digitalimagecafe.com](mailto:info@digitalimagecafe.com).
