Because we gather certain types of information about the users of DigiSeller.com, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.</font></p><font face="arial" size="2">
<p>DigiSeller.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.digiseller.com/">http://www.digiseller.com/.</a></strong></p>
<p>This site contains links to other sites. DigiSeller.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>
<p>Users will receive e-mails regarding their account status with us, however, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings from DigiSeller.com or additional third parties regarding a product or service that DigiSeller.com or third parties may think would be of value to you; see the choice/opt-out section below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Information DigiSeller.com gathers or tracks.</strong></p>
<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. </p>
<p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user ID and password, which the site may use to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. DigiSeller.com uses cookies in only two instances--when you log-in as a DigiSeller.com user and when you click an ad:</p>
<p>Log-in: when you log-in, DigiSeller.com uses a cookie to store your username and password. We do not store any other personal information about you. We use this username and password to identify you in our database but do NOT track the pages you visit on our site. Cookies also enable you, when you log-in, to enter DigiSeller.com as a user without having to log on each time, and to visit member-restricted areas of our site. We encrypt the password for added security. </p>
<p>Ads: We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, our ad company collects cookies received with banner ads, and we do not have access to this information. These cookies are used by our outside ad company to better track ad impressions and click rates.</p>
<p>Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address), unique identifiers (like their username and password), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). The following items are mandatory information we must gather to complete your registration (indicated by an asterisk on the registration page); an active e-mail address, a user name of your choosing, a desired password, your first name, your last name, your current address (including street, city, state, zip/postal code, and country), and daytime phone number. All additional information gathered by our site during the registration process is optional. The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary.</p>
<p>Unique identifiers (such as usernames and passwords) are collected to verify the user's identity. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.  DigiSeller.com works with a third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about how they (flycast) manage the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please go to <a href="http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html">http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html</a></p>
