## Cookies

A cookie is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. Cookies may use your IP address, timestamps, logins. Information collected from cookies is used by us to evaluate the effectiveness of our website, analyse trends, and administer our website. This allows us to determine such things as which parts of our website are most visited and difficulties our visitors may experience in accessing our website.

We use cookies for authentication (logging you into your account), site functionality (the shopping cart, the affiliate scheme and the referral scheme), to analyse our site performance (via Google Analytics) and for advertising management (SendOwl adverts you may see around the internet). These cookies record session information on the device you're using to access our website.

For cookies that are essential, your consent is not required. For the use of the other types of cookies described in this policy, we do ask you for your consent when you first visit our website. You can withdraw your consent or remove these cookies at any time via your browser preferences but you will have to re-login to the SendOwl site if you remove the authentication cookie. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and remove them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). To explore what cookie settings are available to you, look in the "preferences" or "options" section of your browser's menu.

## Data Collection and Storage

SendOwl collects personal data and stores it securely. We also use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary equipment required to run the service. Specifically: Cloudflare, Amazon Web Service, Rackspace, MailGun, Google Analytics, FreeAgent, HelpScout, Stripe and MailChimp. We have contracts in place with our third party vendors that require them to use personal data only as necessary to perform services on our behalf and to implement appropriate security measures as required by law.

## Retention and Withdrawal

We retain your personal data as long as needed for the purposes for which we collected it, plus a reasonable period to take into account the applicable statute of limitation period or to comply with legal requirements.

## Data Transfer

We may transfer your personal data to recipients in countries other than the country in which the personal data originally was collected. Those countries may not offer the same level of protection to your personal data. When we transfer your personal data to recipients outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we will comply with applicable legal requirements by providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal data, including by (i) entering into the European Commission’s EU Standard Contractual Clauses with the data recipients, or (ii) verifying that the recipient has implemented Binding Corporate Rules or has adhered to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. To obtain a copy of the safeguards we have put in place, please contact us as indicated below.

## Data Security

We protect your personal data which we collect and store by implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures. These measures ensure an appropriate level of security and confidentiality for your personal data.

## Your Rights

If you would like to unsubscribe from receiving our newsletter, you can click on the “unsubscribe” link included in our email or contact us as indicated below.

Subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights in relation to your personal data. These rights are as follows: 

  * Request access to your personal data.

If you are not happy with our response, you can contact the ICO in the UK, or other data protection regulator in your country. Important note: if you are a buyer who has been delivered a product via SendOwl you will need to contact the product seller regarding your data rights. SendOwl acts as a data processor and it is the seller who must delete your data from SendOwl as your purchase contract is with them not us.

## Updates

This policy may be periodically updated. Any changes will be notified by email or by a message on the service seen when you first login. Please review carefully before submitting personal data to our site. The date the policy was last updated is indicated at the top of this page.
