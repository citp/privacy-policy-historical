Information automatically collected by DigiCert Sites  
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files on our servers. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. Such information is used to better understand how visitors navigate through our Sites, to enhance your experience while using our Sites, and to make the materials as valuable to visitors as possible. We do not link this information to personally identifiable information.

Note: In addition we may from time-to-time utilize a third-party tracking service to assist in the collection and analysis of such data/information. Cookies are used to track non-personally identifiable information about our visitors, similar to the information collected and stored in our server log files.

Live Chat Sales/Support  
DigiCert utilizes an internal live chat tool for assisting our customers with sales questions and technical support needs; in addition to the customer's name and email address (for purposes of communication), this tool collects information in accordance with "Information automatically collected by DigiCert Sites" above.

Agents  
We use an outside payment gateway and credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

Financial Information  
digicert.com does not permanently store credit card information on its servers. All credit card numbers and identifying financial data are passed directly to the site where credit card orders are processed for all digicert.com customers.

Organizational/Personal Information  
digicert.com requires organizational and contact information as part of the SSL Application process. Information collected (i.e. organization name, physical address, email address, contact name, job title) will be used for the following purposes; to provide requested ssl certificate services, send a newsletter, to communicate with you regarding your account, provide support, and to verify your organizations and/or individual identity. This information is held confidential, and not resold or distributed to third parties.

Editing Organizational/Personal Information (Third Party Verification)  
DigiCert provides direct access to your personally identifiable information, through your DigiCert customer web-pki account. Certain information (i.e. organization name, organization address, contact name) cannot be directly edited, due to the nature of ssl certification.

If ssl order and/or account details have changed, DigiCert will require that you submit a change request. We provide a change request tool inside your DigiCert account. After a change request is submitted and received by DigiCert we verify this information through third party sources (i.e. State business registration sites, D&B, whois domain registrars) and if successfully verified (meaning the third party information matches the change request) the request is approved and our database is updated.

In the unlikely event that you could not log into your account (gain access) to submit a change request, you would alternatively contact us by sending an email to admin@digicert.com or by mailing a written request to the following address:

DigiCert, Inc.  
333 South 520 West  
Lindon, Utah 84042

Sub-User Creation & Account Access  
DigiCert provides a tool for its primary customer account holders, so that they can create sub-users to assist in managing pki functions. The primary account holder can create multiple sub-users, to which personal information is entered (i.e. name, email address, job title, username, and password). The information collected is used to assign account access, permissions, and for contact purposes (i.e. technical issues). Sub-users may also be enrolled to receive DigiCert informational/promotional materials (i.e. DigiCert newsletter).

Note: If a sub-user to an account wishes to change his or her details or to be removed from an account, this must first be requested of the primary account user within their organization, and alternatively direct to DigiCert by email request to admin@digicert.com.

Order Validation Process  
Validation is an essential step in your purchase from DigiCert. In order to ascertain that all SSL Certificates are sold to legally qualified entities, your organization or personal entity must be validated by our staff. DigiCert will verify such information in part by using third parties (i.e. State/Local Government registration web-sites, Dun & Bradstreet, whois/domain Registrars, and phone directories)

Security  
The security of your personal information is important to DigiCert. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Click here to learn more about SSL, follow this link http://www.digicert.com/ssl.htm.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to DigiCert, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable standards to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email DigiCert at [admin@digicert.com](mailto:admin@digicert.com)

Material Changes to Privacy Policy  
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
