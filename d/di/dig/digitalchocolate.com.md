# Digital Chocolate: Privacy

**Your Privacy Matters to Us**   
Welcome to Digital Chocolate. Because we are committed to protecting your privacy in all aspects of our business, we hope you will take the time to read this policy, which explains what information we collect from you and how we use that information. By using our Web site, registering, or purchasing products or services from us, you agree to be bound by this policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it. Please check back periodically. 

**What Information We Collect and How We Use It**   
When you visit our Web site, Digital Chocolate collects your IP address, which we use to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to improve our products and services. Your IP address also is used to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you. 

To participate in the Mobile League, the mobile community from Digital Chocolate, you must create a Digital Chocolate account. Setting up an account requires you to provide your telephone number and a member name, and we will create a PIN for you (together these are your "Account Information"). Please keep this information current by updating your account information on the My Profile page. This information is necessary for us to identify and communicate with you in ratings, rankings, contests, special promotions and other activities in which you participate. In addition, your member name may be viewable in communications with other members of the community and publicly on the Digital Chocolate Web site, so you should choose a member name that you are comfortable having displayed publicly. You may also choose to provide personal information, such as your name, address, and/or telephone number when you enter a contest or drawing or participate in a survey, and you may be required to provide such information if you are selected as a winner in a contest or drawing. We may use this information the same way we use your Account Information. 

If you have chosen to participate in the Mobile League and later change your mind or wish to quit receiving communications, you can always opt out by replying to an SMS text message we send. 

If you subscribe to the Digital Chocolate e-mail newsletter, we may use your e-mail address to send you the communications you requested and to occasionally notify you about important changes to the Web site, new Digital Chocolate features, or special Digital Chocolate offers you may find useful. We encourage you to keep your information current by updating your account information and preferences on the My Profile section of the Digital Chocolate Web site. If you have chosen to participate in the Mobile League or register with Digital Chocolate and later change your mind or wish to stop receiving communications, you can always opt out by replying to an SMS text message we send you. You also have the ability to opt of receiving e-mail by visiting the My Profile section of the Digital Chocolate Web site. Whenever you decide to change your information and preferences, please make sure to change your preferences for each account/email address you have with us. 

**How We Protect Your Information**   
This Web site has security measures in place to help prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. When you access your Account Information, we use a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) that encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. All of the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorized access. 

Except as described in the next paragraph, Digital Chocolate will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or Digital Chocolate believes the disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process, (2) protect and defend our rights and property, (3) protect our customers or users, including from misuse or unauthorized use of the Digital Chocolate Web site, or (4) protect the safety or property of our employees, customers, users or others 

Digital Chocolate may disclose or transfer your personal information (1) to its corporate affiliates (for example its subsidiaries or parent corporation), (2) to its service providers (like fulfillment, hosting or payment services), but only for their use to provide services to Digital Chocolate, (3) to an acquirer in connection with the sale of the business or assets of Digital Chocolate, or (4) where you provide your express consent to such disclosure. Digital Chocolate will require its corporate affiliates and service providers that receive your personal information to limit their use and disclosure of your information to the purposes for which you provided it. 

Digital Chocolate may collect and provide to third parties aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Web site information that do not include personally identifying information. For example, we will not tell our business partners that you bought a particular item, but we may tell them how many customers in certain demographic groups bought certain items. 

**Links to Other Web Sites**   
The Digital Chocolate Web site may contain links to sites operated by third parties that we think may be of interest to you. Digital Chocolate is not responsible for the actions of those parties, the content of their Web sites, use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer, and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of such other sites and to exercise caution in disclosing your personal information. 

**Cookies**   
The Digital Chocolate Web site uses "cookies," which are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information and are used to improve the experience on our Site. Digital Chocolate is not responsible for cookies placed by third party Web sites. 

**A Note About Children**   
At Digital Chocolate, we understand that children's privacy is important. Digital Chocolate does not desire to receive any information from children aged 12 or younger. If you are 12 years old or younger, you should not submit any information to Digital Chocolate. If you are 12 years old or younger and wish to participate in the Mobile League, you may ask your parent or guardian to assist you. In some jurisdictions, you should not submit any personally identifiable information to Digital Chocolate if you are under 14 or 18 years of age.
