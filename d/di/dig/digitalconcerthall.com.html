</p>

<h2>5.  Deletion of Data</h2>
<p>
The data that is received and recorded automatically as stated in Section 3.2, shall be immediately deleted as soon as it is no longer used by Berlin Phil Media, unless the processing of data is necessary for a statistical evaluation or for the purpose of invoicing.

</p>
<p>
The data defined in Section 3.3 that you have disclosed to Berlin Phil Media upon registration as a customer of the Digital Concert Hall or as a guest of the Online Shop, shall be deleted, as soon as it is required by law, or upon cancellation of the agreement on the access to the Digital Concert Hall and the use of streaming services.
