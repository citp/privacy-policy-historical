# Privacy

Here at Digital Strategy Consulting and the Digital Training Academy we take user privacy very seriously.

This page gives you some key information about privacy, but if you have any questions that are not answered then be sure to email us.

Data Protection and Privacy Policy July 2004 for Digital Strategy Consulting's online services.

Please find below our privacy policy for this website and our online services which shall be deemed to be incorporated into these terms and conditions. We are Digital Strategy Consulting Ltd ("Digital") and our registered address is The Digital Hub, 34 Kenway Road, Kensington, London SW5 0RR. Digital takes the privacy of its customers data very seriously. Please read the following policy to understand how we will treat your personal data after it has been collected by us through your use of one of our distribution channels. Those distribution channels will include our website, email services, ansaphones and other channels as they evolve. If this policy changes then we will let you know via our homepage but we assure you that we only use your data as specified here and for our legitimate business reasons.

### When do we collect data?

We can collect data on you from a variety of different sources these include.

  1. When you purchase products or services from the site or via any of our other distribution channels.
  2. When you become a subscriber;
  3. When you speak to our personnel;
  4. Via explicit data capture measures, for example by entering competitions, subscribing to our news services and completing surveys;
  5. Via implicit data capture measures such as studying which pages you read the most and the use of cookies.



_In any of the above cases the data we collect could be personal data._

### What do we do with your personal information?

When you buy anything via the site or give us any personal data as indicated above, we may need to collect information about you to process the transaction, fulfil your order and provide you with the services you expect then and in the future. This information may include, but is not limited to, details such as your name, your address, your phone number and your credit card details.

Unless we have your express consent we will only disclose personal data to third parties if this is required for the purpose of completing your transaction with us. This is of course subject to the proviso that we may disclose your data to certain permitted third parties, such as members of our own group, our own professional advisers who are bound by confidentiality codes, and when we are legally obliged to disclose your data.

By becoming a subscriber you consent to receive from us by e-mail our e-newsletters and details of other special offers which we may think may be of interest to you.

Digital retains and uses your personal information to provide you with the best remote commerce (including electronic and mobile commerce) experience by providing you with a personalised service and to give you details of offers which we think will be of interest to you. We may also use the information to process any transactions you undertake with us and for internal administration and analysis. For quality assurance and training reasons we record most of the calls you make to us.

For any of the above purposes we may send your information internationally including to countries outside the EEA. Some of these jurisdictions offer differing levels of protection of personal information, not all of which may be as high as the UK.

### Cookies

Each web site owned and operated by the Digital Strategy Consulting group uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file of which there are three types:

  * **Session cookies** : These are used to maintain something called session state. If you consider your journey through the site to be a conversation with us and this cookie just reminds the site where we were in that conversation (for instance if at some point in the conversation you asked us to add a report to your basket, next time you click on the basket it is still there). These are required for the site to function but are not used in any way to identify you personally.
  * **Permanent cookies** : These store a few numbers on your hard drive. You can view them by looking in the cookies directory of your browser installation if you are interested. They last for a long time and each time you come to our site you send us a copy of them. We use them to identify you between visits. For instance if you were looking at reports about marketing last time you were on the site and we have a great new report we may use this cookie to recognise you and show you our great deal. They are not required for the site to work but may enhance your experience. We do not store any personal data in these cookies, just a unique number that identifies you to us.
  * **Third Party Cookies** : You may have noticed that we carry advertising from third parties on our site. Occasionally they may send you a cookie. We have no control over these.



Although you cannot block "session" cookies as they are required for our site to function correctly you can configure your internet browser so that it can reject both "permanent" and "third party" cookies. How you do this will depend upon the internet browser you use (for example, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari or Opera etc.) and it is therefore impractical for us to detail here how you can reject those cookies. Please refer to the relevant internet browser manufacturer's website where you should be able to receive all the information you need."

### Third Party Advertising

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you, on our behalf, by our Web advertising partner. Information about your visit to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or any other personal information), is used to serve ads.

To opt out of third party advertising, visit the advertising network partner we have. If you do not see advertising in place then we are probably not carrying it at that time.

### Data
