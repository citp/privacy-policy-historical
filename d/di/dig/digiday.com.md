# Privacy Policy - Digiday

Digiday Media Privacy Policy – Last updated April 19, 2018

**Summary:**

We collect your data (specifically outlined below, but generally basic information about you in a professional context, such as email, job title, company name, etc) strictly to provide you with access to our news, events and other programs. We will not share this data with anyone unless you explicitly consent to us doing so. We honor your right to privacy and will comply with your wishes to remove your data from our systems. 

**Our commitment to privacy**

You deserve to know how we collect and use the data you provide to us, and that’s what we are providing to you on this page. This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Digiday website or through our tools such as Digiday Connect, or the website of our sister sites, specifically Glossy and Gather. This notice was updated in April 2018 to reflect GDPR compliance standards.

**How we use your information**

We use the data you provide to us for the following purposes:

  * Provide you with access to the content and events we produce.
  * Analyze profile or behavioral data to help us improve the products we offer to you.
  * In specific cases we will be contractually obligated to share your data with one of our third party advertisers or partners (for example, webinars, downloads or special events). In these instances, we will make it clear that the data you share will be transferred to the third party. You will always have the option to not have your data shared by not taking part in that specific program.



We will store this information to keep you informed about other relevant products that may be useful to you. 

We will never use or share the information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above.

Some information, such as your IP, address, email address and other data you share with us may be shared with the following third parties who help us run our website and email programs. They will only use this information to serve our needs and are prohibited from using it in any other instance. They are: Bounce Exchange (behavioral marketing and email acquisition), Google (ad serving and website tracking), Campaign Monitor (email), Gravity Forms (email acquisition), Tito (event registration), Open Water (awards programs).

**Consequences of failure to provide consent**

Consenting to allow us to process and store your data is optional. However, failure to provide that consent will prevent us from delivering the content, events and other experiences to you as mentioned above. 

**The information we collect**

Across our web platform and events, you will be presented with the opportunity to sign up for newsletters, purchase event passes, submit your information to access content such as white papers or webinars, apply for eligibility at certain events and more. 

The type of information collected on those pages generally includes but is not limited to:

Email address

Name

Job title or seniority

Location

Company name

Company type

Mailing/billing address

Credit/debit card information (*NOTE: we do not save or store this information, and it will only be shared with our payment processors in order to complete the transaction in which you are engaging.)

Based on the information you provide to us, we may create or append other information to your profile in the interest of better serving you (for example, your interests). As is the case with all data we collect, this will be kept private and for our business purposes only. 

**How to ask us to delete your data**

If you would like to unsubscribe from our communications at any time, you may do so in the footer of any of our emails. If you would like us to delete your information entirely please fill out the form below and we will be in touch with further steps. Otherwise, by continuing to interact with our emails and programs, you provide us with permission to manage and use your data as described above.

**Our commitment to the security of your data**

To prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your data and maintain the accuracy and cleanliness of our own data while ensuring the correct use of it, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
