Digg cookies also allow us to track when you have accessed content through Digg. Each access is tracked using a unique identifier assigned to you in one or more cookies stored by your web browser or application and associated with Digg. 

Digg cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are.

We collect statistical information about how people use Digg ("Aggregate Information"). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information, such as your location (which, in turn, can be derived from your IP address or through location based services used by your device). This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account, your web browser or your Digg application. 

**How and To Whom Is My Information Shared?**

Digg is designed to help you share information that you or people you choose to follow locate on the web with others. As a result, much of the information generated through Digg is shared publicly or with third parties. All Digg content is public.

We may also distribute content and feeds through an email digest to users who have elected to receive such email digests.

_Aggregate Information:_

We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use Digg and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how we interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.

We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our "Agents").

You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents. 

_Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:_

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets associated with Digg, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

If you sign up for The Daily Digg email via the Digg website or in any other Digg application, you will receive an email once daily highlighting some curated or other content on Digg. 

Regardless of whether you decide to receive The Daily Digg, as part of Digg, you may occasionally receive from us email and other communication relating to your Account. These emails will only be sent for important purposes, such as password recovery. 

We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve email deliverability or our customer service. 

**Is Information About Me Secure?**

Your Account information (including your Twitter, Facebook, Google or other third-party logins) is protected for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. 

We endeavor to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. 

We otherwise store all of our information, including your IP address information, using industry-standard security techniques. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you we store, Personal Information or otherwise.
