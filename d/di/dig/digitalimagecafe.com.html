						<p>Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation of

						information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the
						information.</p>
						<p>DigitalImageCafe.Com collects two types of
						data from users: volunteered personal data (such as names,

						<p><b>Personal Data</b></p>
						<p>Personal data is collected when users provide personal

						<p><b>Aggregated Information</b></p>
						<p>Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or
						visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or
						site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example,
						DigitalImageCafe.Com collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that
						is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web
						servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your
						computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from DigitalImageCafe.Com,

						your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow
						DigitalImageCafe.Com to measure activity on the Site and to improve your
						user experience, for example, by remembering your passwords and viewing
						preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the Site
						without reregistering. Cookies are used by DigitalImageCafe.Com to
						measure activity on the Site and make improvements and updates based on which
						areas are popular and which are not. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not
						use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally
						sent in a cookie. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not use information transferred through cookies
						for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with
						any third parties whatsoever. You may occasionally get cookies from our
						advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. DigitalImageCafe.Com does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not
						subject to DigitalImageCafe.com's privacy policies.</p>
						<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set
						yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However,
						it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do
						so.</p>
						<p><b>Use of Information Collected by DigitalImageCafe.com</b></p>
						<p>DigitalImageCafe.com uses both the personal and aggregated information we
						collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content
						of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each
						individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional
						offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.
