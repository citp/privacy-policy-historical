# Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

Your personal privacy is absolutely important to us. Because of that, Gateway operates by these principles -- 

You are never required to provide any personal information in order to use our site for browsing purposes. When we ask for information that personally identifies you, it is used only in providing the information you have requested. For example, Gateway can deliver related news, and alerts on content updates directly to you via email, but to do that we have to ask for your email address. 

At no time does the Gateway share, give, or sell any personal information about you. If you decide to personalize your Gateway visits by setting user preferences, we store those preferences in a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. This cookie lets the Gateway remember your personalized settings between visits. This information is stored on your computer, not on the Gateway server. 

If at any time you believe the Gateway has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email to [developmentgateway@worldbank.org](mailto:developmentgateway@dgfoundation.org) and we will use all reasonable efforts to determine and correct the problem. 

If you have questions about this policy, please e-mail us.
