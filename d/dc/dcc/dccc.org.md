# Privacy Policy | DCCC

_Last Revised: March 17, 2014_

This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed by DCCC with respect to your use of the Web site at [www.dccc.org](http://www.dccc.org/) and other DCCC Web sites, mobile sites, or mobile applications that link to this Policy (the “Services”).  We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated.  We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to stay informed about our information practices.

### What Information Do We Collect?

**Active Collection:** We collect certain information you directly provide to us, such as when you request information, make a donation, sign a petition, make a purchase, send us an email or sign up to receive updates, fill out a form, connect through a social feed, sign up to be a volunteer or host an event, submit a resume, or create an account or profile.  We also collect any information you provide when you post comments or other content or participate in interactive features, surveys, contests, games, or promotions. The types of information we collect may include your name, password, email address, address, phone numbers, credit card number and other information you choose to provide.  We may supplement the information you provide with information we obtain from other sources. For example, we may obtain publicly-available information from voter rolls or partner with other companies to obtain demographic or other data about people who may be interested in our organization.

In addition, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) may require us to collect personal information from donors.  For example, the FEC requires us to collect (and disclose) the name, mailing address, occupation, and employer of all individuals whose donations exceed $200 per calendar year.

**Passive Collection:** When you use our Services, we automatically collect certain information. Such information includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system and browser type, the unique ID number associated with your mobile device, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on our Services.

We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” or web beacons.  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website.  Among other things, cookies help us improve our websites and your experience.  If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions.  When you view a video on our websites, a “flash cookie” could be set on your computer.  Removing and rejecting browser cookies may not affect flash cookies.  To learn more about flash cookies, including how to delete or disable them, visit [adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security). If you remove or reject cookies or flash cookies, it may affect certain features on our websites.  Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on our websites or in our emails to collect information about usage and campaign effectiveness.

We may use third-party analytics services to help us analyze how users use our Services.  These analytics services may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies when you use our Services.  The data collected typically includes information such as your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use, links clicked, the time spent on Web pages or applications, and advertisements viewed.

We also work with third-party advertising companies that may use cookies or other technologies to serve ads on other websites based on your visits to our websites and other websites. These third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, such as your IP address, the browser you use, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked, and conversion information.  Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising on other websites that is targeted to your interests and to understand how users responded to such advertising. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear gifs used by the third parties. For more information about targeted advertising and how to opt out of having information about your web browsing used for targeted advertising, please visit: aboutads.info/choices.

If you create or log into your account through a third-party social networking site, we will have access to certain information from that site.  We may also collect information that you post on DCCC pages located on third-party social networking sites.
