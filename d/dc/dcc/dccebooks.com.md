## **Disclosure of Personal Information**

To help us provide you with superior service, timely completion of purchases and returns, as well as accurate shipments, we may share certain information relating to you within the David C Cook corporate family of entities which we are part of. We may also share certain Personal Information with strategic, co-branded, or joint partners and with third party processors and vendors, as necessary, to process your orders or requests and otherwise administer the account (however, we will only share credit or debit card information as required to effectively process your credit or debit card payment, or to analyze trends or usage of our website). These entities help us provide many important services to you, such as extending credit, fulfilling and shipping orders, providing customer service and performing customer satisfaction surveys.

We may also share information with third parties to verify information collected from you in order to protect against potential fraud, and we may receive Personal Information about you from these parties.

Your election to opt-out of the data sharing within the “Your Rights” section entitled “How to Opt Out of Future Communications” is not an opt-out for the data sharing described in this paragraph.

On occasion, we may be (or have a good faith belief that we are) required by law or litigation to disclose Personal Information pertaining to you. We may also disclose such information if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance or safety, disclosure is necessary. At times, we may share Personal Information in aggregate, so that no one individual can be identified (i.e., anonymous).

We may also transfer Personal Information to a third party as a result of a sale or acquisition, merger, or bankruptcy involving us.

_Independent Contractors_

From time to time, we may use certain independent contractors and other third parties to operate components of our site, fulfill orders, or assist us in operating or improving our site.  In this capacity, we may allow these independent contractors and third parties to collect the information described in this Privacy Policy for us.

## **Transfers of your Personal Information outside of the European Union**

If you choose to provide us with Personal Information, we may transfer that information to our affiliates, subsidiaries, other third parties or processors, to other countries or jurisdictions around the world, including outside of the EU.

Transfers to third party providers

We may transfer your Personal Information to third party providers that we use to operate this website, located outside of the EU. Where we transfer your Personal Information to third party providers we ensure your Personal Information has an adequate level of protection. The third party providers are either based in a country which has an adequacy decision by the Commission (including the EU-US Privacy Shield), for more information, visit http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm, or we have entered into model contract clauses with them.

## **Data Retention**

We only keep your information for as long as necessary in relation to the purpose for which we are processing that information. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

We maintain a data retention policy which we apply to all data in our care. Where your personal information is no longer required we will ensure it is securely deleted.

## **Your Rights**

Data protection laws give you rights in relation to the Personal Information we hold about you. In certain circumstances, we may need to restrict your rights in order to safeguard the public interest (e.g. the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g. the maintenance of legal privilege).

Unless otherwise stated below, please use the contact information in the introduction regarding exercising these rights. In order to evaluate these requests we may require additional information to confirm your identity.

## **_Your California Privacy Rights_**

If applicable, this information would include the categories of Personal Information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared such information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2015 will receive information regarding 2014 sharing activities).

To obtain this information, please send an email message to the address provided above with “Request for California Privacy Information” in the subject line and in the body of your message. The requested information, if required by law, will be provided to you at your email inbox.

## **Security**

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all website pages where Personal Information appears or is collected. If you wish to make a purchase from our website, you must use an SSL-enabled browser (for example, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari). We use 128 bit encryption in our SSL sessions to protect personal customer information, including credit card information transmitted to our website for making purchases.

When we transfer and receive certain types of financial information such as credit card numbers during the order checkout process, we redirect you to a secure server. We follow Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards in the handling of your credit card information.

For any website to which you have an account login and password, you can help us protect your Personal Information by keeping your account password confidential at all times and by not sharing it with any other person. You should also change your password frequently and be sure to use a combination of letters and numbers.

Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. By using any service we provide, including our website and user interfaces, or providing information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of any such service or our website.

## **Information You Make Publicly Available**

You should be aware that information (including your name, email address, address, or phone number) provided by you in a posting on the website or any public page, bulletin board or social media site or function is available (even after you stop participating on the website) to any other individual who has access to that same website and may be used by another individual in a manner unintended by you, including as a target for unsolicited communications. You should therefore treat any information provided by you in the content of a submission or post to the website as public information. For this reason, we urge you to act cautiously in providing any such information in your submissions or posts, as we are not liable for any use or misuse by an individual user of the information you provide in a submission or post.
