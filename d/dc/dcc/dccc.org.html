                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>The DCCC is committed to protecting the privacy and security of visitors to  our website. Outlined below is our online privacy policy for personal  information collected through this website. If you have questions about this  policy, please let us know.</p>
<h2>Collection and disclosure of information:</h2>
<p>The DCCC collects some personal information (that is, information that can be  directly associated with an individual) in order to process its credit card  contributions. The DCCC also collects names, addresses and e-mail addresses from  those who affirmatively request to be placed on DCCC e-mail lists, through which  they may receive information about DCCC activities, breaking news or important  events.</p>
<p>It is the general policy of the DCCC not to make personal information  available to anyone other than its employees or agents who need to know that  information in the course of their duties. However, the DCCC is often required  to disclose information regarding its contributions to comply with campaign  finance laws. For example, Federal law requires us to use our best efforts to  collect and report the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer of  individuals whose contributions aggregate in excess of $200 in a calendar  year.</p>
<p>Additionally, from time to time, the DCCC may share personal information with  organizations whose issues or goals are similar to our own, and which we believe  would interest you.</p>
<h2>Correcting and updating your information:</h2>
<p>Finally, those who have previously requested to be placed on DCCC e-mail  lists may unsubscribe by visiting by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the  bottom of the email you receive from us.</p>
<h2>Browser information collected on the web site:</h2>
<p>The DCCC analyzes our website logs to constantly improve the value of our  website. We use an external service to provide real-time reporting of browser  accesses to our site to DCCC staff and our agents. This includes page views,  unique views, unique visitors, frequency of visits, and peak-volume traffic  periods. We do not use this service to gather, request, record, require, collect  or track any Internet users' personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We use cookies on our site to customize the experience of our visitors and to  support some necessary functions. We also use cookies to better understand how  our visitors use our site. DCCC Cookies are not shared or revealed to other  sites. We do not look at cookies on your machine for other sites.</p>
<p>You have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser  preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a  cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. For more information on how to modify  your browser settings to block or filter cookies, see  http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/.</p>
<p>However, note that if you reject some or all cookies, your experience at our  site and on other sites throughout the World Wide Web may not be complete. In  addition, if you do not allow cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of  personalized content delivery offered by other Internet sites or by us.</p>
<h2>Children's privacy:</h2>
<p>Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply  with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its  accompanying FTC regulation establish United States federal law that protects  the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or  collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to  solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our  site to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13  whenever age-related information is requested. We would remind parents that they  have a duty to supervise the Internet activities of their children.</p>
<p>It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information  pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we  verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise  delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt  of information by children under 13, please do so here.</p>
<h2>Security:</h2>
<p>The DCCC maintains a variety of physical, electronic and procedural safegards  to protect your personal information. For example, we use commercially  reasonable tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to our  systems. Also, we restrict access to personal information to those employees who  need to know that information in the course of their duties. In addition, we  work to protect the security of your personal information when transmitted via  the DCCC site by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts  information you input. You should know that the DCCC has no control over the  security of other sites on the Internet you might visit, interact with, or from  which you engage in financial transactions.</p>
<p>Your own efforts to protect against unauthorized access play an important  role in protecting the security of your personal information. You should be sure  to sign off when finished using a shared computer, and always log out of any  site when viewing personal information.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Advertisements and Services:</h2>
<p>We may also use third parties to serve ads, maps, or other information on our&nbsp;websites. These third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our&nbsp;websites (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number). They do this by using cookies, Web beacons or other technologies.&nbsp; Information collected may be used by these third parties for purposes such as to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and better understand the usage and visitation of our&nbsp;websites and the other websites tracked by these third parties.&nbsp; Certain third-party advertisers or other services may also collect personal information you provide in fields and forms presented in connection with their ads and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or technology in third-party ads or services, or for information you choose to provide in connection with these third-party ads and services.&nbsp; We encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn&nbsp;more about their use of your information.&nbsp; To opt-out of behavioral advertising&nbsp;of third party ad networks used&nbsp;on our website visit the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" title="blocked::http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;opt out page</a>.</p>
<h2>Changes to this policy:</h2>
<p>The DCCC will revise or update this policy if our practices change, or as we  develop better ways to keep you informed about them. You should refer back to  this page often for the latest information and the effective date of any  changes. If we decide to change this policy, we will post a new policy on our  site and change the date to indicate when it was last modified. Changes to the  policy shall not apply retroactively.</p>
