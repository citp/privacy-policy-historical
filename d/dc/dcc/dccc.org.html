<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  
  
  <p>The DCCC is committed to protecting the privacy and security of visitors to our website. Outlined below is our online privacy policy for personal information collected through this website. If you have questions about this policy, please let us know.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  <h2>Collection and disclosure of information:</h2>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>The DCCC collects some personal information (that is, information that can be directly associated with an individual) in order to process its credit card contributions. The DCCC also collects names, addresses and e-mail addresses from those who affirmatively request to be placed on DCCC e-mail lists, through which they may receive information about DCCC activities, breaking news or important events.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>It is the general policy of the DCCC not to make personal information available to anyone other than its employees or agents who need to know that information in the course of their duties. However, the DCCC is often required to disclose information regarding its contributions to comply with campaign finance laws. For example, Federal law requires us to use our best efforts to collect and report the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employer of individuals whose contributions aggregate in excess of $200 in a calendar year.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>Additionally, from time to time, the DCCC may share personal information with organizations whose issues or goals are similar to our own, and which we believe would interest you.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  <h2>Correcting and updating your information:</h2>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>Finally, those who have previously requested to be placed on DCCC e-mail lists may unsubscribe by visiting by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email you receive from us.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  <h2>Browser information collected on the web site:</h2>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>The DCCC analyzes our website logs to constantly improve the value of our website. We use an external service to provide real-time reporting of browser accesses to our site to DCCC staff and our agents. This includes page views, unique views, unique visitors, frequency of visits, and peak-volume traffic periods. We do not use this service to gather, request, record, require, collect or track any Internet users' personally identifiable information.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>We use cookies on our site to customize the experience of our visitors and to support some necessary functions. We also use cookies to better understand how our visitors use our site. DCCC Cookies are not shared or revealed to other sites. We do not look at cookies on your machine for other sites.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>You have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. For more information on how to modify your browser settings to block or filter cookies, see http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>However, note that if you reject some or all cookies, your experience at our site and on other sites throughout the World Wide Web may not be complete. In addition, if you do not allow cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of personalized content delivery offered by other Internet sites or by us.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  <h2>Children's privacy:</h2>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our site to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested. We would remind parents that they have a duty to supervise the Internet activities of their children.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so here.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  <h2>Security:</h2>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>The DCCC maintains a variety of physical, electronic and procedural safegards to protect your personal information. For example, we use commercially reasonable tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to our systems. Also, we restrict access to personal information to those employees who need to know that information in the course of their duties. In addition, we work to protect the security of your personal information when transmitted via the DCCC site by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. You should know that the DCCC has no control over the security of other sites on the Internet you might visit, interact with, or from which you engage in financial transactions.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>Your own efforts to protect against unauthorized access play an important role in protecting the security of your personal information. You should be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer, and always log out of any site when viewing personal information.</p>

  
  
  
  
  

  <h2>Changes to this policy:</h2>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  <p>The DCCC will revise or update this policy if our practices change, or as we develop better ways to keep you informed about them. You should refer back to this page often for the latest information and the effective date of any changes. If we decide to change this policy, we will post a new policy on our site and change the date to indicate when it was last modified. Changes to the policy shall not apply retroactively.</p>
