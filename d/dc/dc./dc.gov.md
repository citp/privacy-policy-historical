# Privacy and Security

###  Collection and Use of Online Information 

When you visit our website, certain data, such as your computer's unique Internet protocol (IP) address, will be automatically collected and sent to the servers that support our website system to help us provide better service and a more effective website. In addition, as part of these efforts, sections of this site may place a small text file (typically only a few bytes) on your hard drive to allow us to identify your computer. We will not attempt to read any additional information on your hard drive, and we do not combine collected information with other personal information to determine your identity or your email address.

In order to visit certain areas of this site, or to use certain services, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as your name, address, or gender. If you are making a payment, we may ask for your credit card number and billing address. If you decline to provide requested information, our ability to serve you may be limited. But you will still be able to visit the site and take advantage of the wealth of information it offers.

###  Secure Transmissions 

Please be assured that this site is equipped with security measures to protect the information you provide us. We encrypt credit card numbers and other data that must remain secure to meet legal requirements.

###  Protection of Personal Information 

Your individual identifying information will not be shared, sold, or transferred to any third party without your prior consent, or unless it is required by law. It is available to District web development employees only for the purpose of maintaining the DC.Gov web portal and improving the site visitor experience.

###  Other Sites 

The District of Columbia's privacy policy extends to District government websites only. If you access another organization's website through the [www.dc.gov website](http://dc.gov/ "dc.gov"), you should read that organization's privacy policy to determine its website practices.
