The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize DCincome.com pages, or register with DCincome.com site or services, a cookie helps DCincome.com to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same DCincome.com website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the DCincome.com features that you customized.</font></div>
