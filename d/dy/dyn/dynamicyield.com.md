  1.  _For Internet-based Advertising and Improvement of our End-Users Experience_

We use the Personal Information and the Other Information (collectively, the “ _Information_ ”) for purposes of analyzing trends, administering our Offering, improving our services, and to gather demographic information about our End User base as a whole.
