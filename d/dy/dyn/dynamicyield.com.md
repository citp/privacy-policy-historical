# Privacy Policy — Dynamic Yield

##  Last Updated December, 2019 

DY (the definition of which shall henceforth include Dynamic Yield Ltd. and all its wholly owned subsidiaries, including Dynamic Yield, Inc., Dynamic Yield UK Ltd., Dynamic Yield GmbH and Dynamic Yield APAC PTE Ltd.) respects the privacy of the users of its website at http://www.dynamicyield.com (the **“Website”** ) and of its customers and business partners (collectively **"Users"** ) and is committed to protecting the information DY collects from its Users. We have created this privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. 

1. **The Information We Collect**

DY may collect the following types of information from its Users: 

2. **Personal Information**

We may collect individually identifiable information, which is related to Users, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual ( **“Personal Information”** ), including the following: 

  * Data submitted when registering to our Website: As part of a registration process (e.g. when requesting a demo), we may collect your phone number, full name, e-mail address, and details regarding the company you work in required to provide you our Services. 
  * Voluntary information: We also collect information which you provide us voluntarily. We collect your information when you apply for a job through our Website, purchase our services (including financial information), respond to communications from us, contact our support, communicate with us via email, Website and through any online platform. Please note that when you apply for a job through our Website, you may be required to share with us your CV and other required information in order for us to consider your application. 



We may also record telephone conversations, subject to the consent of the participants in the call. 

  * Device Information: We may also collect Personal Information from your device, such as geolocation data, IP address and other online identifiers (i.e. online data collected from User’s devices, applications and protocols which leave traces which may be used to identify Users). 

It should be made clear that you have no legal obligation to provide us with Personal Information and the submission of such information is subject to your sole discretion and consent. However, if you will not provide us with the required information we may not be able to provide you with the information/services requested by you. 




3. **Other Information**

In addition to Personal Information, we may collect additional information which cannot be used to identify Users (collectively, the “Other Information”). Such Other Information may include: 

  1. From Your Activity

Information that we or our technology providers may automatically collect when you visit, access, and/or use the Website, such as your internet service provider, domain server, type of computer, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections/features of our Website that you visit/utilize, number of links you click while on the Website, search terms, and operating system. We may also collect statistical and other data related to your use of our Website or other services as well as information on Website usage patterns. This information is collected and used as non-individually identifiable information. 

  2. From Cookies and other tracking technologies

We may use session identifiers, web beacons, cookies, JavaScript tags, and other tracking technologies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a User’s hard drive containing information about the User's online behavior, as well as its device. We use these technologies to enhance the User's experience of our Website. We also use this information to collect statistics about the usage of our Services, perform analytics, deliver content which is tailored to your interests and administer services to our Users, advertisers, publishers, customers and partners. You can learn more on the cookies we use and control your preferences through our Website's cookie management tool – Cookie Settings




If we associate Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat such information as Personal Information. 

4. **End User Data**

By using our services, we allow our Users to use various features of our solution, such as optimization of their end user's ( **"End Users"** ) interactions by offering automated personalization. In order to provide these services, DY may receive End Users' Personal Information. DY receives such Personal Information solely as a "data processor" and is acting only in accordance with the documented instruction of its User (in its capacity as a DY customer). 

A User may only share with DY such Personal Information in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy legislation, including without limitation, that it has received all applicable consents required for such sharing. 

5. **Legal basis for processing**

Processing of Personal Information is necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations towards you and providing you with our services, to protect our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations.
