Welcome to the Dynadot web design, web hosting, and domain name registration service ("Service"). The Service is made available subject to this Privacy Policy. By using the Service, you agree, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Policy. This policy may be updated from time to time, so please check back here periodically. 

  
**What information is collected?**

When opening an account, the Service collects your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, and fax number. We collect this information because it may be necessary to contact you about your account. Also, if you are registering a domain name, this information is required by ICANN.

If you are placing an order, the Service collects your credit card number and/or other billing information. This information is used only to collect payment for services rendered.

 **What information is shared?**

The Service does not share your information with anyone except when absolutely necessary. If you are registering a domain name, your contact information will be listed on the public Whois service. This listing is required by ICANN. When placing an order, we submit your billing information to the payment processor. Otherwise all information is kept private. We do not sell information to mailing lists, or send advertisements on behalf of other companies. 

Though the Service makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us. ([Subpoena Policy](https://web.archive.org/subpoena_policy.html))

 **What emails will you send me?**

We send emails updating you on the status of your order. We may email you a renewal notice if a domain or service is about to expire. We may email you about a matter directly concerning your account. We may email you if we update a policy that affects your account. If you registered a domain name, we will send you an email once a year to remind you to update your contact information, as required by ICANN. We may also send you a Dynadot newsletter periodically, but you have the option of disabling this feature.

 **Do you use "cookies"?**

The Service uses cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies only. Once a user closes the browser, the session cookie simply terminates. We use cookies to remember where you are in our website. For example, by setting a cookie when you sign into your account, we know that you are an authorized user. If you reject the cookie, you will not be able to enter the account area of the site.
