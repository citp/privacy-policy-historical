# Dyn Privacy Policy - Dyn

Last updated: September 24, 2015

**DYN’S PRIVACY POLICY**

Dynamic Network Services, Inc. (“Dyn,” “Us,” or “We”) is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of the www.dyn.com and other Dyn website that reference this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Sites”) and the services offered through the Sites (the “Services”).

This Privacy Policy describes Dyn’s practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information collected from you through your use of our Sites and Services. It does not apply to Dyn sites, services and products that do not display or link to this statement or that have their own privacy statements.

At this point, you are probably asking, “what is Personal Information?”. “Personal Information” is information provided by you to Dyn which personally identifies an individual, such as your name, home address, personal email address or telephone number, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by Dyn. ** **

**I.   COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION GENERALLY**

We collect Personal Information from the users of our Site and Services. We will not sell, share, transfer, or use the Personal Information we collect from you other than as stated in this Privacy Policy.

**II. INFORMATION YOU GIVE TO US**

When you visit or use our websites or interact with Dyn, there are times when Dyn will ask you to provide us with your Personal Information. For example, when registering for a new account on our website, we will prompt you to provide us with your name, physical address, email address and phone number. There are also instances in which you may elect to provide us with Personal Information when you use our Sites or interact with Dyn. For example, you may provide Dyn with your Personal Information when you send email using Dyn’s email delivery services or when you contact Dyn’s technical support team.

**III. INFORMATION WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT FROM YOU**

While visiting our Sites or using our Services, we may automatically collect Personal Information from you through the use of cookies and other mechanisms.  For example, when you visit Dyn’s website, we automatically collect device identifiers (e.g., device model, operating system, browser version, and other data that may be used to identify a device), IP addresses, device configurations, browser history, and geographic location data.

**IV. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Dyn uses your information for a variety of purposes related to its provisioning, maintenance and improvement of the Services, and the development of new services. For example, Dyn uses your Personal Information to administer your account, provide technical support and to communicate with you about your account, the Services and other exciting news about Dyn.

Except as provided above, Dyn will not use your Personal Information, nor will it share your Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Dyn, unless one of the following circumstances apply:

**With your consent:**

****We may use and share Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Dyn when we have your express consent to do so. For example, you may enter into an agreement with Dyn that permits Dyn to use or disclose Personal Information under circumstances other than those described in this Privacy Policy.

**For internal use, research and product development:**

We may use your Personal Information for our internal use, research and product development. ** **

**For domain registration:**

When you use Dyn’s domain name registration services, we are required to disclose your Personal Information in accordance with the RAA and ICANN policies. Please see Section VIII for more information regarding our treatment of Personal Information in connection with our domain name registration services.

**For external processing:**

We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us based on our instructions or other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

**To detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or other legal related issues:**

We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Dyn if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

– meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.

– enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.

– detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.

– protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Dyn, our users, third parties or the public as required or permitted by law.

For example, we share device-identifying information, which may consist of Personal Information, to iovation, Inc., a trusted partner that specializes in fraud prevention services, for the purposes of combating fraudulent purchases on our Sites and other fraudulent activities on the Internet.

If Dyn is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any Personal Information and give affected users notice before Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Dyn has established a global network presence and may process Personal Information on our servers in many countries around the world. You agree that we may process Personal Information on a server located outside the country where you reside.

Dyn will not sell or license your Personal Information to a third party for that third party’s own direct marketing purposes.
