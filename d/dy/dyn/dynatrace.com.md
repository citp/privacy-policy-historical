In jurisdictions where your consent is required at the point of collection before any sharing of your information can take place, you will be given the option to opt-in before such information is being shared, and to opt-in to the transfer of your contact information to a third party.

In other jurisdictions, we may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information, or subsequently through ‘opt-out’ mechanisms.

**_3.2 Other Privacy Considerations_**

Please remember that information you submit in a discussion groups or forums will be deemed public information and will not be kept as confidential. There is a risk in such communication venues that information can be collected and used by others. Please be careful and responsible when you are participating in such discussion groups or forums.   


**_3.3 Update or Correction of Personal Information_**

We make our best effort to respond to your requests to update or correct your personal information. If you believe that dynaTrace does not have your most current personal information, you can use one of the other communication channels at the bottom of this notice. If requested, and to the extent permissible by applicable law relating to the retention of records or otherwise not required for valid business purposes (such as fulfillment of transactions), you may request that we use our best efforts to remove such data from dynaTrace repositories.   


**4\. Transfer and Sharing of Information**

**_4.1 Transfer of Information_**

Since dynaTrace is a global company, we provide company information to our worldwide offices, with information processing taking place in many countries. The personal information that you have provided to us, for the purposes set out above, will be transferred to servers in the United States, and there may be further transfers to other countries in which dynaTrace has operations or to our outside contractors for the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information. Your consent is required for the provision of the products and services set out above as well as for the collection and transfer of your personal information for the purposes identified above.   


When you submit your information via our web sites, you expressly consent to the collection and transfer of your personal information for the purpose identified above, and you understand, if you reside outside the United States, that this information may be transferred to other companies of the dynaTrace group in the United States or to other countries that may have less protective data protection standards than the region in which you are situated (including the European Union), in which case dynaTrace will have taken steps to ensure that the collected information, if transferred, receives an adequate level of protection.   


**_4.2 Sharing of Information_**

From time to time, and in jurisdictions where it is permitted, we may provide your information to dynaTrace Partners to communicate to you information or offers about products or services that they believe are important to you or your business. If you prefer that we not provide your information to our business partners, you may let us know using one of the methods described in this policy, dynaTrace provides a number of ways for you to "opt-out" of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our partners by "opt-out" options provided at the point of collection, through e-mail notices, or through other preference management that may be available depending on the service or web-site.

If you do not wish to continue receiving our e-mail newsletters or bulletins you can opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the "unsubscribe" address in the body of the email. In jurisdictions where sharing personal information is prohibited without your "opt-in", no information will be shared without your prior consent.   


**_4.3 Third Parties_**

In addition, dynaTrace may retain the services of outside contractors to provide services for us (e.g. ship products, provide technical support, or handle order processing).

If you elect to purchase a software license through one of dynaTrace’ authorized online resellers, your personal data will need to be shared between the dynaTrace reseller (as your vendor) and dynaTrace (as the software manufacturer and licensor). Furthermore, in order to manage purchases and license renewals by dynaTrace customers, dynaTrace will need to share your personal information with a billing system service provider. 

Such service provider will process data of dynaTrace’ customers only on behalf of dynaTrace. (These examples are not exhaustive, and may change from time to time).   


We require that all such contractors keep the personal information of our customers secure and confidential. We have contractually bound third parties to such restrictions and require that these contractors provide for appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure the data, that they use personal information only on behalf of dynaTrace and that they do not share personal information with others or use your personal information for their own marketing purposes.   


**_4.4 Legal Disclosures_**

Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for dynaTrace to disclose your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by applicable law. No personally identifiable information will be disclosed to any law enforcement agency or governmental agency except in response to (i) a subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; or (ii) a legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for information, in that dynaTrace would be in breach of local law were it to refuse to provide such information, and it or its officers, executive or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process, or,

Where such disclosure is necessary for dynaTrace to enforce its legal rights pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction from which such information was gathered.   


**5\. Security of Personal Information**

We have taken appropriate security measures, consistent with international information practices, to protect your personal information. These measures include, on our web sites and Internet-enabled technologies, administrative, technical, physical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction.   


**6\. Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information**

We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when users visit our web sites. Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable visitor. It tells us information such as how many users visited our sites and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our web sites to our visitors. We collect this information either through “cookie” technology or with “web beacons”.

Additionally and through our various tracking methods discussed above and using log files, we may track domain names, IP addresses, and browser types from people who visit our site. We use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout dynaTrace’ Web site. Such information is not correlated with any personal information.   


**7\. Links to OTHER WEB SITES**

At the dynaTrace Web sites, there are a number of links to companies with whom we have a relationship. 

dynaTrace is not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners. We encourage you to read their privacy statements, as they may differ from ours.
