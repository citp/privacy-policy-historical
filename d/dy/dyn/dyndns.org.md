# Dyn Privacy Policy - Dyn

Last updated: November 14, 2011

## Our Approach to Privacy in Plain English

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.dyndns.com&sealid=101)Before we let our lawyer get into the weeds on how we keep your information private, let’s get something straight. We believe in the golden rule when it comes to privacy – we wouldn’t do anything to you that we would get annoyed about if it were done to any of us (and some of us are pretty paranoid). If you have a question about what personal information we collect or how we protect it, read on or feel free to shoot us an email at [privacy@dyndns.com](mailto:privacy@dyndns.com). We respect your privacy and want to answer any questions you have.
