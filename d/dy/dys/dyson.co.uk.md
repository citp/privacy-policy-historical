## What personally identifiable information do we collect about you?

We collect information on our website users in several ways, including through cookies, registration and emails sent to us via our website. Our information collection includes the following:

  * We require registering users of our website and owners registering their products online to provide us with a name, telephone number, email address (if they have one) and postal address. We may also ask for additional information to assist us with our development of new products.
  * If you purchase a product through our website we will require you to provide us with the above information plus your payment and delivery details.
  * If you send us email messages, you will automatically provide us with your electronic mail address, as well as any other personally identifiable information you include in the text of your message.
  * We collect and store from all visitors to our website, whether they actively provide us with information or merely browse our website, the internet protocol (IP) address of the computer they are using, the browser software they use and their operating system, the date and time they access our website, the internet address of the website from which they linked directly to our website. We use this type of information to track website usage, to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our website and to help us make our website more useful.
  * Like most internet websites, we use "cookies," small files that websites use to store information on your computer. For example, the contents of your entry for a quiz on our website are temporarily stored in cookies on your computer. The cookies that we use are removed when you shut down your web browser and cannot be seen by any other website. We may also use cookies to track users as they travel through our website - for instance, we might use cookies to count the total number of unique users who are accessing the website over a particular period of time.

## What do we do with the information we collect?

We use personal information to provide you with the services and goods you have requested. Unless you have informed us that you do not wish to receive such information, we or our agents may periodically contact you about our products and services.

We may perform statistical analyses of user behaviour (for example, by analysing the website usage data gathered passively from all users) in order to measure relative consumer interest in the various areas of our website. These analyses assist us in our product development efforts.

## With whom do we share the information we collect?

We share personally identifiable information with companies who are acting as our agents (as long as they agree to use the information for the legitimate business purposes specified by Dyson). Our agents include, for example, service agents who we use to service Dyson products. We will also share personally identifiable information if you have given us permission to do so. Finally, we will share your personally identifiable information if required by law to do so, including in response to legal processes, such as a court order or subpoena, or to comply with other federal, state or local laws.

We may disclose statistical information to third parties in aggregate form without revealing any personal details about our users (for example, 50% of our customers buy product parts online). Dyson Ltd. will not reveal your personal identity in connection with the disclosure of such information.
