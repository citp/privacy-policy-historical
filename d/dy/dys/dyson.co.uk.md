## Secure online shopping at Dyson.co.uk

All Dyson website activity that incorporates your personal details is securely encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology prevents you from inadvertently revealing personal information using an insecure connection.

You will know when you are in secure mode as your browser will display a padlock symbol. This will happen as soon as youre required to login at the checkout page. i.e. before you enter any personal or payment details and also when accessing the My Profile section where you manage your account.

By clicking on the padlock symbol, you can check that the SSL certificate for the website is valid and in date.

Secure mode means that all of your details are encrypted to help keep them secure. Encryption creates billions of code combinations to protect each transaction made on our site, so your card details cannot be viewed by anyone else using the Internet. 

During payment, we also ask for your card billing address as an additional security check. New security checks like the card signature code protect your credit card details online. No credit or debit card details are stored once your order has been processed. 

**If you have any further concerns about security, please[email customer services](mailto:askdyson@dyson.co.uk) or call our customer service team on 0800 298 0298**

## Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode

Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode is a simple and secure way to shop online.

This service is offered by Visa and MasterCard, in association with the bank that has issued your credit / debit card.

This service provides additional security when shopping online by ensuring your card is not being used by someone else.

If the credit / debit card you're using to pay for your order qualifies for one of these services (not all cards do), you will be taken to a page hosted by your card issuer. This is a completely secure process, the information you provide will only be visible to you and your card issuer, and would never be shared with other parties.

Using this service is a matter of adding a quick extra step to your online checkout procedure. Enrolling takes moments and is secure. Each future purchase will require the password you set up when enrolling.

If you would like to learn more about these services, please contact your card issuer who should be able to assist you.
