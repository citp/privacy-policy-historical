###  Dyson privacy commitment 

“Dyson engineers are focused on making hardware and software work together to develop high performing technology which understands the environment it is in and how to improve it. Our machines are increasingly intelligent, but with knowledge comes great responsibility. We are deliberately lean with the data we capture and handle it with great respect. We treat as a priority the protection of your privacy and the protection and secure storage of your data.” 

Sir James Dyson

To make better technology and experiences, we collect information through Dyson websites, the Dyson Link app and through our connected machines. We protect that information carefully and handle it with discretion. We’re open about its use and will always make you aware of the information you’re sharing. For your peace of mind, we have explained precisely what information we collect, why we collect it, how we protect it, and the controls you have to change it or delete it. Your trust is important to us. And as our technology becomes more advanced, we’ll continue to put your privacy first.
