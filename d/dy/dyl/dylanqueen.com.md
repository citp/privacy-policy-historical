You can correct or update your personal information at any time.

By voluntarily providing us with personal information, you hereby represent that you are the owner of such personal information or are otherwise authorized to provide it to us. You acknowledge and agree that you are consenting to our collection, use, storage and/or disclosure of such personal information in accordance with this Policy.

## How does **DylanQueen.com** use and disclose information collected from me offline?

As we collect most information through our Site, this Privacy Policy applies only to online collection of personal information. We also protect all personal information that is collected from you offline, such as through phone calls. If we contact you by telephone regarding an order or payment, we will ask only for the personal information needed to place your order or resolve your issue. When we need to store information related to an order, we enter it into our database through SSL encryption (See the Data Security section above for more information).

This Policy does not attempt to cover all possible offline methods of collecting or using personal information, however, we will treat any offline collection, use, or disclosure of personal information in a manner consistent with our online practices.

## Data Security

The Site incorporates physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, including Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") for all financial transactions through the Site. We use SSL encryption to protect your personal information online, and we also take several steps to protect your personal information in our facilities. Access to your personal information is restricted. Only employees who need access to your personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to your personal information. Finally, we rely on third-party service providers for the physical security of some of our computer hardware. We believe that their security procedures are adequate. For example, when you visit the Site, you access servers that are kept in a secure physical environment, behind a locked cage and an electronic firewall.  
While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee complete security. 100% complete security does not presently exist anywhere online or offline.

## Where can I find updates to this policy?

To keep you informed of what information we collect, use, and disclose, we will post any changes or updates to this Privacy Policy on this Site and encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please contact us with any questions about the Privacy Policy.
