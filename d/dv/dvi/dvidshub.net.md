An example is provided after paragraph 8. in this figure] for statistical purposes. This U.S. Government computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.
  4. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, software programs are employed to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

### EXAMPLE

Information Collected from DVIDS for Statistical Purposes xxx.yyy.com -- [28/Jan/2008:00:00:01 -0500] "GET /Defense/news/nr012708.html HTTP/1.0" 200 16704 Mozilla 3.0/www.google.com

xxx.yyy.com (or 123.123.23.12)-- this is the host name (or Internet protocol (IP) address) associated with the requester (you as the visitor). In this case, the requester is coming from the xxx.yyy.net address. Depending on the requester's method of network connection, the host name (or IP address) may or may not identify the user's specific computer. Connections via many Internet Service Providers (ISP) assign different IP addresses for each session, or only connect to the Internet via proxy servers, so the host name may only identify the ISP. The host name (or IP address) may identify a specific computer if that computer has a fixed IP address. [28/Jan/2008:00:00:01 -0500] -- this is the date and time of the request "GET /Defense/news/nr012708.html HTTP/1.0" -- this is the location of the requested file 200 -- this is the status code - 200 is OK - the request was filled

16704 -- this is the size of the requested file in bytes Mozilla 3.0 -- this identifies the type of browser software used to access the page, which indicates what design parameters to use in constructing the pages www.google.com -- this indicates the last site the person visited, which indicates how people find the requested file. Requests for other types of documents use similar information. Unless otherwise stated, no personally identifiable information is collected.
