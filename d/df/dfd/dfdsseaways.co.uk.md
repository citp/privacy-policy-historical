# Privacy Policy - DFDS Seaways

**SECURITY**

 DFDS website is secure when you go through to the payment part of the online sales process. We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to protect your personal information.  SSL is currently the preferred method to securely transfer credit card and other sensitive data over the internet.

   **DFDS PRIVACY POLICY  
 **  
DFDS is committed to protecting your privacy. Below we explain how we use any passenger information and how we protect your privacy. 

 Data-protection.   Please note that as a carrier DFDS is obliged under the law to register the identity of our passengers and to inform governmental authorities hereof. Consequently, we need to register certain information when you book, including your name and identity. 

 The registration of this information is also a necessity for us to enable us to secure a smooth completion of the travel and to provide you with the services you have ordered.  We will delete the registered information soonest after the completion of the voyage or when the information is no longer needed in accordance with national law or your agreement with DFDS. 

 The register is kept by DFDS A/S, Sundkrogsgade 11, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.  You are always welcome to contact us to be informed of the registration.  If you have signed up for receiving our e-mail newsletter – or receive other kinds of unwanted marketing material - you can always unsubscribe by a link in the newsletters or by contacting DFDS.

 We use tracking software to monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site.  This software does not enable us to capture any personally identifying information.

  **WHY DO WE NEED PASSENGER INFORMATION/HOW DO WE USE IT?**

 In addition to our obligations under law we collect information about you for two reasons: firstly to process your order and second, to provide you with the best possible service.  When you book with DFDS, we need to know your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail address?, credit or debit card number and expiry date. We also need to know all the name(s) of the passenger(s) travelling. This information allows us to process your booking and to send through your travel itinerary by post. We ask for your telephone number so that we can contact you urgently if there is a problem with your reservation.

 If we offer you a subscription to our e-mail service, DFDS mail, we will ask for your name and e-mail address so that we can send you our e-mail newsletter. Your name is not required to subscribe to our e-mail service, and you will be able to opt out at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link on the e-mail newsletter.   When you enter a contest or other promotional offer, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

 If you find errors in the information please notify us thereof so that we may correct it.

 We may use the information we collect occasionally to notify you about new DFDS services, important functional changes to the web site and special offers we think you'll find valuable.  If you would prefer not to receive this information, please send an e-mail to [travel.sales@dfds.co.uk](mailto:travel.sales@dfds.co.uk)

  **HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?**

 When you book with us, we use secure server software which encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. This encryption ensures that the information is reasonably protected against unauthorised interception.

 In order to comply with our obligations under the Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998, we also follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access to that information.

   **OUR USE OF COOKIES**

 DFDS use cookies in the booking system, to ensure consistency in the flow of the booking.

 Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. These can be deleted by you from your hard drive if you so wish.

 Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to prevent that.  Without cookies you can use most of the features on the web site, but not the booking system.  So our advice is not to disable cookies in your browser. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. 

  **WILL DFDS DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?  
**    
We never disclose information about a passenger to any other person or organisation without your consent unless there is an emergency situation that requires it or we are legally required to do so.  DFDS reserves the right to pass your information on to trustworthy third parties that we use for the provision of certain services, for instance allowing DFDS customers to book hotels quickly and easily by, for example, transferring details from the DFDS booking form to our partners' booking forms.

 If you do not wish DFDS to pass on your information to these third parties, please send an e mail accordingly to [travel.sales@dfds.co.uk](mailto:travel.sales@dfds.co.uk)

 DFDS may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will contain no personally identifying information.
