We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in monitoring their children’s use of the Services.  In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from children under the age of 13, we will make efforts to promptly delete that information. 

##  **2.        _Types Of Information We Collect_**

Werequire certain information from you in order to provide the Services to you.  ·

**_Personal Information_**.  When you use our Services, we may collect and store personally identifiable information that you have directly provided on a voluntary basis. Personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.  An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his/her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.  For example, when you register with us, we may collect certain information from you, includingyour name, email address, username, nicknames and passwords, and social networking usernames and information.  Once registered, you may also have the option of completing a user profile.  Your user profile may include Personal and non-Personal Information, depending on how you complete the profile.  We do not require Personal Information from you in order to access our Sites or some aspects of our Services.  However, you will not be able to utilize certain features of our Services unless you create a profile and share with us some Personal Information.  For example, you will not be able to play some of our Games, receive materials such as newsletters, or make purchases without a profile being created.

**_Non-Personal Information_** : When you use the Service, we may collect information that will not be able to specifically identify you, such as demographic information (for example, gender or age) and information about your interests and preferences.  In many cases, such demographic and preferences information is optional.  In other cases, such as online surveys, we collect this information on an anonymous basis.  We may group any such information into aggregate user data in order to describe the use of the Services to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in response to a government request.  We may also group demographic and preferences information and responses to surveys that we collect from visitors into aggregate data for the same purposes.  However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to the Site.  Should we link any demographic or preferences information to any Personal Information, then such demographic information and preferences information will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Statement.

**_Technical and Usage Information._   **To enable your use of our Services, we collect technical and usage information such as your IP address, your browser type, browser language, referring and exit URLs, interactions with other users, usage statistics with the Services, and device identification information regarding the computers, the servers or other devices with which you use our Services.  

##  **3.        _Who Is Collecting Information_**

Information subject to this Statement is collected by Neople, a corporation formed under the laws of theRepublic of Korea,with offices located in theRepublic of Korea.  When you are asked for Personal Information while using the Service, you are sharing that Personal Information with Neople, its parent, its sister companies, and its affiliates, unless specifically stated otherwise.   **Please be aware that Neople and some of the other mentioned companies are located in the US and other countries outside of the European Economic Area and as such may have a data protection level that is not identical to that maintained in the EEA.**  As a result of this sharing, you may receive communications from any of the Neople entities.  

In addition, some Services are provided in conjunction with third party companies, and thus your Personal Information may be collected by a company that is not a part of or related to Neople.  This collection may occur by itself or occur simultaneously with Neople’s collection of the same information.  However, in such instance you will be notified at the time the Personal Information is collected.  Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Neople.  If you do not want your Personal Information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of Personal Information by not using that particular Service or by not providing any Personal Information at that time.

##  **4.        _When and How We Collect Information About You_**

We may collect information about you and your use of the Services in a number of ways:

_When Provided Directly from You_.  As mentioned above, we collect information about you directly from you in certain circumstances, including when you register for an account, you submit gameplay preferences, or you communicate directly with us through e-mail, web submission or other communication channel.

It is our policy not to share your Personal Informationwith third parties unaffiliated with Neople for their own use except in the following circumstances: 

**·          _With Your Consent._   From time to time we may ask for your consent to share Personal Information with third parties.  For example, from time to time we may make on behalf of third parties special offers to our users.  If you decide to respond to the offer, you would be sharing information with that third party, and may be sharing information with Neople simultaneously.  When we ask for your consent, it is your choice whether to grant it or not, though certain features, offers or functionalities of the Service may be impaired depending on your choice.  If you choose to not give your consent, we will not share your Personal Information with the third party at issue.**

**·          _Third Party Service Providers._** We may use third party service providers, such as payment gateway companies, platform service companies, and analytics companies, to help us provide or improve the Gameswe offer you.  We may share your Personal Information with these third party service providers so that they may provide their services to us.  In addition, some third party service providers may require the transmission and/or storage of information about you and your activities on services and devices not controlled by Neople (including Personal Information about you).  For example, use of Google Analytics, a web analytic service offered by Google Inc. ("Google"), requires that certain information about your activities be transmitted to and stored on Google servers based in the US.  Google will use this information in order to evaluate your usage of our Servicesandto make reports on Service activities.  Google may also match up this information with other data of Google (or the applicable third party) depending upon your current device and privacy settings.  As Neople does not control your device’s privacy settings or the privacy settings of third party tools and technologies that function alongside the Service, Neople encourages you to review your device’s privacy settings as well as your privacy settings of third party tools such as those offered by Google and the various online advertising networks.

**·          _Other NeopleUsers.   _Some of your Personal Information (including information in your profile such as your name, nickname(s), and country) **may be visible to other Neople **users as a normal part of the Service**.  Other Neopleusers (both those who are your social networking friends and those who are not your social networking friends) may be able to view information about your uses and interactions, such as your game results, scores, and profile information.

**·          _Legal Purposes._   **We may provide your Personal Information to third parties where we have a good faith belief that doing so is required by law or to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities.  We may also provide your Personal Information to third parties in order to protect the rights or property of a third party or Neople, including enforcingour Terms.

**·          _Health or Safety_.  **We may share your Personal Information when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health or safety of you, another person, or the public generally.

·         **_Sale or Merger._   **If Neopleis involved in a major business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of its assets, we may transfer your PersonalInformation to the successor organization in such transition.  If material changes to Neople’s privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, we will amend the Privacy Statement in accordance with Section 9 below.

·         **_Game Events._**   For some game related events, we may share information, including your profile and nicknames, with third parties or the general public.  For example, a Game-related tournament may include a description of the players, an overview of the Games played, etc.

·         _Licensors, Licensees, Developers and Co-Publishers._ We may share your Personal Information with our business partners such as our licensors, licensees, developers and co-publishers, during and upon termination of the contracted service in case the license agreement with the partner licensors and developers requires as such.  

With respect to your Non-Personal Information and Technical and Usage Information, we may share such information with third parties for various purposes, including for the purpose of explaining our user demographics or improving the quality or delivery of our services and the marketing materials available through the Games.  We may use third party advertisers and advertising networks to deliver advertising within the Services.  We may share your Non-Personal Information, including your operating system, country location, and Games usage information with these third party advertisers for the purposes of delivering these advertisements.  Moreover, these third parties may utilize technological means to deliver the advertisement, including use of their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from the Site.  If an advertiser on a third party advertising network asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or advertising network may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.  If you want to prevent a third party advertising network from sending and reading cookies on your computer, you must visit each third party advertising network's website individually and opt out (if they offer this capability).

Finally, some features may allow you to share information about you and your use of the Service with others.  For example, the Service may allow you to link your Service account with third party social networking sites.  When doing so, please understand that you are sharing information directly with third parties, not with Neople, and that those third parties have their own set of information practices.  When you engage in such sharing, you may be allowing others to view the content you Post, your name, and more.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content on the websites of third parties, nor for any sharing of your information (Personal Information or otherwise) with any third party.  We recommend careful consideration before you Post anything to such media, and we strongly recommend that you read their privacy policies and terms and conditionsof useto understand how they collect, use, and share information.

##  **7.        _Your Choices_**

You may at any time indicate that you wish us to stop processing your Personal Information (if such Personal Information is necessary for you to have an account, you will no longer be able to use the Game and may no longer be able to use other aspects of the Service).

You may also at any time "opt out" of receiving marketing materials described in this Privacy Statement from us and/or our affiliates and advertisers working on our behalf.  The marketing materials that we send you (e.g., e-mails) will indicate that such materials are from us and will always provide you with a method of "opting out" of receiving future materials of a similar nature.  To “opt out,” you may utilize the opt out functionality included in our e-mails, you may change your communication preferences within the Neople Launcher (as may be applicable to communications on that platform) and you may contact our customer support department by logging into the customer support portal and submitting a ticket, or you may edit your account information on our Service accordingly.  Keep in mind that, while Neople takes reasonable steps to require its affiliates, advertisers and business partners to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our users and otherwise to handle your Personal Information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from us or independently. 

Notwithstanding any request to opt out, Neople may continue to use your Personal Information to contact you with information that is important to our offering of the Service (e.g., a notice of an update to this Privacy Statement) and administrative or billing-related issues.  In addition, we may not delete Non-Personal Information or Technical or Usage Information in response to an “opt out” or deletion request.  Neople reserves the right to retain and use this information consistent with this Privacy Statement even after a request to delete your Personal Information is received provided that the information being retained is not Personal Information.  If you wish to never be contacted by Neople again, please submit a ticket to our customer service department asking them to delete your account.  This action is permanent, so please request this only if you are absolutely sure this is what you want.

Finally, please note that any information shared with a third party, whether through the Service or not, is subject to the control of that third party, and therefore a request made to Neople to “opt out” or to delete Personal Information will not have any impact on the third party’s use or storage of that information.

##  **8.        _Security of Your Information_**

Although we do not represent that we follow any particular, independent code of best practices, we maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your information. For example, we protect some of your Personal Information by using a firewall and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.

While we take reasonable precautions against possible security threats, there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet, so we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur.  We strongly recommend that you take steps to maximize the security of your Personal Information, such as not sharing your login information and logging out of your account after you are done using our Service.

We may store your Personal information in various countries andterritories.  You acknowledge such storage and the transfer of your Personal Information from one territory to another, even when these territories do not provide for the same personal data protection as the EU/EEA.

All users should be aware that, when they disclose Personal Information to others through or using the Service, the information being shared may be made publicly available and may be collected and used by others outside of the control of Neople.  When you disclose about you to others, you do so at your own risk and we are not responsible for protecting the information that you choose to communicate to other users on the Service, or for the actions of other users.

##  **9.        _Changes to Our Privacy Statement_**

We recommend that you return to the Site and/or Service periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of this Privacy Statement.
