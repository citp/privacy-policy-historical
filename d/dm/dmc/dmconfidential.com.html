<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><b>Why do you have a Privacy Policy?</b>&nbsp; 
To let you know how we treat identifiable, personal nonpublic information about 
you.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><b>Our Privacy Policy</b>.&nbsp; In providing 
services and products to you, we collect certain nonpublic personal information 
about you. Our policy is to keep this information confidential and strictly 
safeguarded, and to use or disclose it only as needed to provide services or 
products to you, as disclosed in this statement or as otherwise required by law. 
Protecting your privacy is important to us. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><b>What Types of Information About Me Do You 
Collect?&nbsp;</b> We gather various types of information about you when you use 
or inquire about our products or services, during the account sign up process 
and throughout your on-going relationship with us. This may include your name, 
email, address and Web site usage information. We also have records of our 
communications with you. The Web site usage information we deal with includes 
cookies, log file and affiliate statistical information. Like most standard Web 
site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, 
browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform 
type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the 
site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic 
information for aggregate use.<br><br>We use persistent session based cookies 
which are unique per user. These persistent session based cookies are used for 
site navigation, session state maintenance and tracking user's interests which 
enhance the experience on our site by providing targeted offers that the user 
may find more relevant. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to 
log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If 
users decline the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this 
is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.<br><br>Some of our 
affiliate partners use cookies on our site (for example, for tracking which 
affiliated programs users are clicking on). However, we have no access to or 
control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set 
cookies for advertising.<br><br>Cookie and log file information is not tied to 
personal information except for technical site maintenance problems and is not 
shared with third parties. You can remove cookies by following directions 
provided in your Internet browser's “help” file.<br><br>If a user elects to use 
our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the 
friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a 
one-time email inviting them to visit the site. We store this information. The 
emails are for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the 
success of our referral program.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><b>Information We Disclose</b>.&nbsp; We do not 
disclose your email address to any third party marketers. We do not sell your 
identifiable, personal information to anyone, except as described in this 
statement. We disclose tracking information, on an anonymous basis, only to our 
affiliates, to third parties that we hire to help us provide products and 
services to you, or as otherwise allowed or required by law. Keep in mind, that 
if you take advantage of an offer from a third party marketer, they may 
independently send you offers if you give them your personal information. In 
this case, you should determine such third party marketer’s privacy policy and 
inform them separately if you wish to decline receiving offers in the future. 
Keep in mind also, that we use a technology called framing that may place our 
website URL in your browser window even though you’ll be on another site in the 
framed page. We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this 
Web site. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><b>How Is Information About Me Used?&nbsp;</b> 
We use information about you to provide products and services to you, for 
tracking your purchases via anonymous identifier from affiliated sites so that 
we can provide the service.  We do not sell personal non-public information about our users to marketers. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><b>How can I update my information?</b>&nbsp; 
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, 
phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we 
provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally 
identifiable information. This can usually be done&nbsp;<span class="747052722-08092004">here <a href="http://www.dmconfidential.com/Contact-US.php">http://www.dmconfidential.com/Contact-US.php</a></span></font></p>
