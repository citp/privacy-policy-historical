## Sharing Information

DMI may share user’s Personal Information with third parties in the following scenarios:

  * When users provide Personal Information in connection with a job search, it is maintained in a database that is managed by a third party service provider. DMI’s service provider is authorized to use the information only in connection with hosting, managing, and maintaining DMI’s resume database.
  * DMI may provide users Personal Information to companies that provide services on DMI’s behalf. Such companies may include a payment processor or customer service provider. These companies are authorized to use Personal Information in order to provide such services to DMI. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients.
  * DMI shares users Personal Information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; and when DMI believes, in good faith, that disclosure is necessary to protect DMI’s rights, protect user’s safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

  * To any third party, with users prior consent to do so.
  * DMI shares users Personal Information within DMI’s family of companies. DMI has central sales functions that cross-sell different services to individual clients.
