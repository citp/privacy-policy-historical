It also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your information and how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns.

Where applicable, DMI indicates whether and why you must provide DMI with your Personal Data, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal Data when requested, you may not be able to benefit from the Services, if that information is necessary to provide you with the Services or if DMI is legally required to collect it.

## Personal Data Collected via Automated Means

DMI also collects Personal Data automatically from your use of the Services:

  * When you use our Services, DMI and our third party service providers may collect information from you through automated means, such as cookies, web beacons, and web server logs. By using the Services, you consent to the placement of cookies, beacons, and similar technologies in your browser and on emails in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The information collected in this manner includes IP address, browser characteristics, device IDs and characteristics, country code or approximate location, operating system version, language preferences, referring URLs, and information about the usage of our Services. We may use this information, for example, to ensure that the Services function properly, to determine how many users have visited certain pages or opened messages or newsletters, or to prevent fraud. We work with analytics providers such as Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends. These services may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/>, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.
  * We also work with third parties advertisers (collectively, “Advertisers”) who may also use cookies or other technologies to track your use of the Services. Advertisers also may use cookies to track your online activities across websites over time to provide interest-based advertising. Some of our Advertisers are members of the _[Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)_ or the _[Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)_. Please visit these organizations’ opt-out pages to learn about how you may opt out of receiving web-based personalized ads from member companies. Please visit your device’s settings or install an app blocker application (e.g., AppChoices) to learn more about how you may opt out of receiving personalized ads in mobile apps.
  * If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, most browsers allow you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html>. If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.
  * **Social Media Features** : The DMI website includes social media features such as the Facebook “Like” button, and other widgets, such as the “Share-This” button or interactive mini-programs that run on the site. These features may collect a User’s IP address, which page being visited on the site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the DMI site. A user’s interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
  * DMI uses Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as hypertext markup language (HTML) 5 to store content and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML 5 LSOs.

## Sharing Personal Data

DMI discloses information that we collect through the Services to third parties in the following circumstances:

  * To our third party service providers who provide services such as website hosting, data analysis, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, online advertising, auditing, and other services.

  * To a potential or actual acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in bankruptcy or similar proceedings). You may have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity’s planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.

## Accessing Other Sites via Links

The DMI website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by DMI. Users should be aware that DMI is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. DMI encourages users to be aware when leaving DMI’s site, and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects Personal Data.

## Security

DMI has global hosting centers that store and process Personal Data in various locations in Europe and the United States. DMI takes reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data in these centers and in other locations in the United States from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. DMI also makes reasonable efforts to keep Personal Data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current, and complete. When DMI collects Sensitive Personal Data on websites or through services, DMI encrypts the transmission of that information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and therefore, DMI cannot guarantee its absolute security.

DMI will retain any Personal Data collected, as described in this policy, for a maximum of 5 years or as long as necessary to provide users with required services. If users wish to request that DMI no longer use Personal Data to provide services, contact DMI at [privacy@dminc.com](mailto:privacy@dminc.com).

DMI will retain and use Personal Data as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. DMI will retain Personal Data processed on behalf of clients for as long as needed to provide services to the clients.  When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of Services provided to the User, the nature and length of our relationship with the User, possible re-enrolment with the Services, the impact on the services we provide to the User if we delete certain Personal Data, mandatory retention periods provided by law, and any applicable statute of limitations.

### International Cross-Border Data Transfer

DMI is based in the United States.
