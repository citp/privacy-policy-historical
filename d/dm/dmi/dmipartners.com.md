### Links to Other Sites:

If you click on a link to a third party site, (including on an advertisement), you will leave our Sites and go to the site you selected.

### Security:

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
