### EXPANDED DATA PROTECTION REGULATIONS

### Our data protection policy

To ensure that we can successfully provide expert services, we strive to collect as much information as possible on our customers and business partners. At the same time, the protection of personal data is something we take very seriously. Our customers, business partners and employees should all be aware of Koelnmesse’s policy with regard to personal data, and we give everyone the opportunity to influence how their data is collected, processed and used.

### Scope of the Data Protection Regulations

These Data Protection Regulations are valid for all personal data collected, processed or used by Koelnmesse or its subsidiaries. This includes information that we received as a result of your participation in a trade fair or other event and your business correspondence with our company as well as data that was passed on to us by third parties to use for international trade fair purposes.

Also included is data contained in your registration documents, information received from your visits to our websites (which is used for purposes of technical administration) and data obtained as a result of a security check to determine if you are authorized to access any protected Internet pages.

### Why should you provide Koelnmesse with personal information?

By providing us with your personal details, we can, in return, offer you several benefits. Specifically, it becomes easier and more convenient for you to

  * plan your visit to a trade fair, because we can provide you with specific information in the run-up to the event
  * register as a visitor for certain events, so that you can receive all the benefits to which you are entitled by purchasing a ticket online
  * receive personal messages and special offers from us or our exhibitors
  * smoothly plan and carry out your trade fair participation while benefiting from the Koelnmesse Group’s extensive range of services
  * save time so that you can devote yourself to topics that really interest you



By providing us with your data, you also enable us to conduct market research so that we can provide better services and customer care, and further optimize our offerings.

You can provide us with your personal details in a variety of ways, e.g. by creating an account for our e-shop, by faxing us a visitor or exhibitor registration form, by entering a competition, by registering in person at the exhibition centre or by taking part in a survey.

### What kind of personal data do we collect?

Whenever you visit one of our websites, our servers generally store not only the technical parameters needed for transferring web page data, but also the following information:

  * Date, time and length of your visit to one of our web pages
  * The IP number that has been assigned to you by your Internet provider
  * The web page you are currently visiting
  * The tool (i.e. web browser, operating system) you have used to access the site
  * The terms you use in the search engines and for the site search
  * Whether a site was successfully accessed or not
  * What information was called up (incl. downloads)
  * From which server you accessed the site



### Cookies and website logs

Some of our web pages transmit a cookie (a small text file) to your computer, which allows us to recognize your computer the next time you visit our website. If you do not want to receive any cookies, select your Internet browser’s “Help” function to find out how to either deactivate all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie can be saved. If you would like to learn more about cookies, visit:  [ www.cookiecentral.com ](http://www.cookiecentral.com/)

Whenever you visit our website to browse, read articles or download information, we collect and save data related to your visit: e.g. a clearly defined ID; the name of the host and the domain from which you have accessed the Internet, your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, the date and time at which you accessed the website, and the URL of the website from which you have directly accessed our website. We use this information to monitor visits to our websites and to recognize repeat visitors. This information helps us make our websites even more useful. However, we delete this information again after a certain amount of time has elapsed.

Additional data is saved only if it is needed to process a visit to a trade fair or other event staged at Koelnmesse or if you voluntarily provide us with such information.

However, Koelnmesse may from time to time also receive your personal data from third parties. This can happen, for example, when personal information is forwarded by associations, exhibitors, foreign representatives, chambers of commerce and industry, or commercial address brokers. If you do not want us to use personal data that you have not directly sent us, please contact the address in the legal notice and notify us of this fact.

If you send us any emails, we collect, process and use your personal data to help us provide our services and conduct any necessary correspondence. This is also the case when you send us contact forms, letters or faxes. You can of course stipulate at any time that your details should not be used for advertising purposes. You are regularly made aware of this right in all of our informational and advertising letters.

We have taken every technical and organizational step required to ensure that all of the data that is collected, processed or used is protected against loss, deletion, tampering, forgery, unauthorized access or unauthorized forwarding.

In addition, our employees are obliged to keep data confidential. They regularly receive training in data protection and data security.

### Which information do we forward?

Koelnmesse forwards your personal data to third parties if this is necessary to process your orders, organize your trade fair participation or invoice services.

However, our aims are more far-reaching. We wish to get to know you and bring you into contact with our partners and interesting exhibitors. What’s more, we want to be able to give you even more support for your next trade fair participation.

However, it is your choice if you wish to take advantage of additional services and provide us with data that we can forward to third parties.

For visitors to events organized by Koelnmesse, we forward trade visitor data to exhibitors, associations or other third parties only under the following conditions:

  * The trade visitor has not objected or, if necessary, has given permission to have his/her data forwarded to exhibitors, associations or third-party companies
  * Before forwarding data to exhibitors, associations or third-party companies based abroad, we always check to see if the data protection standards in the recipient’s home country are comparable to those in Germany. If not, the recipient is obliged to contractually assure Koelnmesse that corresponding data protection standards will be met



or

  * Koelnmesse sells a trade fair event to another company. As a result of such a sale, personal data that is directly related to the event may be forwarded to the buyer.  
Koelnmesse does not sell or otherwise transfer your personal data to third parties for any other reason.  
Our foreign representatives and our service partners in Germany and abroad are contractually obliged to fully comply with the pertinent data protection and data security regulations and guidelines. Koelnmesse checks to see that this obligation is met.
