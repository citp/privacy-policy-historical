#### INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU DIRECTLY

You may provide information directly to us in several situations, including when you create a user profile, subscribe to services or features, submit content on the Site, make online purchases, enter contests, or complete surveys. You are not required to provide information directly to us, but if you decide not to do so, you may limit the features that you are able to access through the Site.

The information that we may collect includes, but is not limited to:

\- contact information, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number; photographs;

\- financial payment information, such as credit card or other payment information; geo-location information; and

We also may collect certain information by other means when you use the Site, including information about your computer or device, hardware, software, connection information, Internet Service Provider (“ISP”), browser type and language, clickstream data, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, your interactions with email messages (such as whether a message was opened), and standard server log information.

The Site may use cookies, which are small data files that are stored on your computer’s hard drive, for a variety of purposes to personalize and improve your use of the Site. For example, we may use cookies to remember your username and password or collect information about your browsing activities in order to provide you with more relevant content and ads. Most Web browsers can be set to erase or block the acceptance of cookies or to inform you when a cookie has been sent so that you can refuse the cookie. However, please note that refusing a cookie may limit your access to certain areas and/or functions of the Site, such as your ability to view or post content, enter sweepstakes, and make purchases. By using the Site, you consent to our use of cookies in connection with this Site.

In addition, the Site may use Flash cookies, which are similar to the cookies discussed above but which cannot be managed via your browser settings, as with traditional cookies. Typically, users can manage Flash cookies through a Flash player if they have one installed on their computer. Like many companies, we also may use other technologies that are similar to or that work in conjunction with cookies to help us monitor your usage of the Site (e.g., Web beacons, site tags, clear GIFs, etc.). Without your express permission, we do not use such web beacons to collect personally identifiable information, such as names, email addresses and phone numbers, and we do not allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information through such web beacons.

#### USE OF INFORMATION

We may use information that we collect on the Site for a variety of purposes, including to:

\- Provide you with the products, promotions, services, and information you request; Process your orders or transactions;

\- Contact you via email and otherwise about products, services, and events that we think might be of interest to you;

\- Maintain or administer the Site, perform business analyses, or for other internal purposes to improve the quality of our business, the Site, and the products and services we offer;

\- Customize and personalize your use of the Site; and

\- As otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent. From time to time, we may match information collected from you through the Site (including both information that you provide directly and Site usage information), and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties.

#### SHARING OF INFORMATION

We may share information with other entities, including, but not limited to, the following:

**Select Business Partners**. With your permission, we may share your information with select business partners, including our authors or promotional partners so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional materials, advertisements, and other materials. Penguin is not responsible for the privacy practices of these business partners, which may use your information for their own purposes. If you opt in to this information sharing and later want us to stop sharing your information with our business partners, please follow the procedures outlined in the “Your Choices and Your Information” section below.

**Corporate Parents and Affiliates**. We may share your information with our corporate parent(s) and other affiliated entities for a variety of purposes, including business, operational, and marketing purposes.

**Service Providers**. We may share your information with service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf (such as to host the Site, manage databases, perform analyses, send communications for us, or provide certain other components of the Site).

\- protect our legal rights or the users of our Site;

\- protect the safety and security of our users;

Information may be transferred to one or more parties in connection with a transaction, including without limitation, a corporate acquisition, merger, restructuring, reorganization, sale, change of ownership or control, transfer of assets, bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event of such transfer, the company that acquires or controls your information may not have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Other Parties With Your Consent**. We may share information about you with other third parties when you consent to such sharing. This may include when you submit or post information to a user profile or a public area of the Site, such as a chat room, bulletin board, discussion, blog or other community tool.

In addition to the disclosures above, we may disclose non-personal information to third parties, such as aggregate website usage data or demographic reports that do not describe or identify individual users.

#### SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES

Penguin has worked with certain third-party social media services to offer you their services through the Site. For example, you can use third-party social media services, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, and others to share information about your experience on the Site with your friends and followers on those services. These social media services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on the Site. These other services also may notify your friends, both on the Site and on the services themselves, that you are a user of this Site or about your use of this Site, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies.

You also may be able to link an account from another website or service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to the Site. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign in to certain features on our Site. If you link your account from a third party site or service, we may collect information from those third party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.

#### YOUR CHOICES AND YOUR INFORMATION

**Commercial Email Messages and Third Party Marketing**

You may be able to opt in to receiving promotional emails from us. If you opt in, you may later opt out of receiving these promotional e-mails by clicking on an opt-out or “unsubscribe” link within the promotional e-mail you receive. Penguin also might offer you opportunities on the Site where you can opt out of receiving promotional emails or having your information shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Please note that if you use these Site-based opt-out methods, it may be necessary for you to opt out on more than one Penguin site in order to avoid receiving all promotional email messages from Penguin. Please note that opt-out requests may take up to 10 days to be effective. Your request not to receive unsolicited commercial emails from us will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature. For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial messages.
