# DKPSystem.com - Privacy Policy

**Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on every page on our site.

 **The Information We Collect:**

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on DKPSystem.com. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:   
Name   
Address   
Email address   
Phone number   
Credit/Debit Card Information   
(etc.) 

**The Way We Use Information:**

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

You can register with our website if you would like to receive our newsletter as well as updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to improve our website functionality or to share with partners. For example, we may tell a partner that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Email Addresses on Customer Sites**

Our customer sites typically require email addresses to register on their site. Those email addresses remain accessible only to the administrators of the customers' site and DKPSystem.com staff. While we **can** guarantee we will **not** share your email addresses with third parties, we cannot guarantee what customers' sites' administrators will do with the email addresses.

 **Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
