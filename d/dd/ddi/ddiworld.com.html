<p>This Privacy Statement covers only information that is
collected through the Web Sites ("Sites") covered by this Statement
and does not cover information that may be collected through software
downloaded from the Sites.</p>


<h2><a name="_Toc248733442">Information Collection</a></h2>

<p>DDI or our clients are the owners of the information
collected on the Sites covered by this Privacy Statement. DDI collects
information from our users at several different points on the Sites. </p>

<p>Clients use the Sites to collect candidate/applicant
information regarding a specific job posting or opening.&nbsp; There is no direct
relationship between the client’s site and the Sites, although at a client’s
request client sites may link to content on the Sites.</p>

<p>In order to use full functionality offered by the Sites, a
user may be required to provide certain Personal Information (PII) such as name
and email address.&nbsp; We do not automatically collect any personal data that can
identify you without your having prepared and submitted it.&nbsp; PII information
may be shared and used by DDI and the client for which the site is hosted as
well as any other 3rd party vendors secured by the client to facilitate
candidate or employee assessment or selection processes.</p>

<p>Information collected is never sold to third parties nor
shared without prior consent.</p>

<p>For sites where you have a user account, you are solely
responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password.
If you believe that confidentiality has been compromised, contact privacyofficer@ddiworld.com.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733443">Information Use</a></h2>

<p>DDI will not use individual records or other data in a
manner that identifies individuals or client organizations as the source of the
data, except for the purposes for which they are collected. </p>

<p>Data summaries aggregated across many participants and
client organizations may be prepared for broader system evaluation and
improvement, and for the development of assessment norms.&nbsp; Innovations and
improvements derived from these analyses are used to improve DDI's current and future
assessment systems and tools.</p>

<p>Summaries of these aggregated analyses may be presented to
public audiences (e.g., at scientific conferences).&nbsp; Review of our general
approaches and accumulated results with professional audiences ensures that
DDI's assessment methods remain up-to-date with best practices and
professional, technical, and legal standards.&nbsp; In these summaries, individual
client organizations and participant identities remain completely confidential,
and results (due to aggregation) cannot be linked to individuals or client
organizations.</p>

<p>Summaries of aggregated data may also be used to create normative
profiles for assessments.&nbsp; Normative profiles will not identify individuals but
may identify some or all of the client organizations that are contained within
the profile for the purpose of defining the characteristics of the norm sample.&nbsp;
Organization names will not be cited unless 5 or more organizations contribute
to the aggregated profile.&nbsp; At no time will normative profiles be used that
allow an individual's or contributing organization's data to be identified as
such. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733444">Cookies</a></h2>

<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer
tied to information about the user.&nbsp; Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to
any personally identifiable information while on our site except when personal
information is stored on a voluntary basis through the process of logging into
the Site with a user name and password, in which case the information can be
used to pre-populate user information into form fields presented by the Site.</p>

<p>The Sites use both session cookies and persistent cookies.</p>

<p>For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the
cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on
the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable
us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the users'
experience on the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following the
instruction outlined in the user's Internet browser Help. More information on
cookies and the use of cookies by Web Sites can be found at <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/">www.cookiecentral.com</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733445">Log Files</a></h2>

<p>Like most standard Web Site servers we use log files to
collect statistical information about how our Sites are used.&nbsp; This information
includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service
Provider (ISP), referring / exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and
number of clicks.</p>

<p>The information we collect is used to analyze trends,
administer the Sites, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad
demographic information for aggregate use. The data is not linked to personally
identifiable information.&nbsp; We may choose to track the above log file
information against individual user profiles only when the user has voluntarily
set a uniquely identifiable cookie by logging on with a user name and password
to the Sites.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733446">Service Announcements</a></h2>

<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly
service related announcement.&nbsp; For instance, if one or more of our Sites is
temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.&nbsp; Generally,
users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their
account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733447">Customer Service</a></h2>

<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide
requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply
via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733448">Sharing</a></h2>

<p>Though we make industry standard and reasonable effort to
preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when
required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary
to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process
served on the Sites.&nbsp; We do not share personal information with Third Parties
except as otherwise noted in this Statement.</p>


<h2><a name="_Toc248733449">Third Party Intermediaries and Service Providers</a></h2>

<p>In order to provide certain services to you, we may on
occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us with
information from third party sources such as for background checks.&nbsp; We also
partner with other third parties to provide specific services or functionality
to our Sites (ex: live chat). &nbsp;We only share the essential information
necessary for the third party to provide these services.&nbsp; These third parties
are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose
of providing these services.&nbsp; We do not share, sell, rent, or trade PII with
third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733450">Business Transitions</a></h2>

<p>In the event another company goes through a business
transition, such as a merger, acquiring DDI, or selling a portion of its
assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the
assets transferred.&nbsp; Data collected via some Sites, however, belong to our
client organizations and would not be considered an asset to be transferred
without prior consent.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733451">Choice/Opt-out</a></h2>

<p>Users who provide information requested by the Sites, or who
continue to use the Sites after having an opportunity to review this Privacy
Statement, thereby consent to the terms of this Privacy Statement and to DDI's
use of the information it collects as described in this Privacy Statement.
Those who do not agree to this Privacy Statement may not use the Site. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733452">Links</a></h2>

<p>Sites can contain links to other sites. Please be aware that
DDI is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.&nbsp; We
encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Sites and to read the
Privacy Statements of each and every Web Site that collects personally
identifiable information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by the Sites.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733453">Security</a></h2>

<p>The Sites take industry standard and reasonable precaution
to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via
the Sites, their information is protected both online and offline.&nbsp; When you
enter sensitive information on our Sites, we encrypt that information using
secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect
the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
receive it.&nbsp; No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.&nbsp; Therefore, while we strive to use
commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot
guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>The servers that store personally identifiable information
are in a secure environment in a locked facility.&nbsp; Only employees who need the
information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally
identifiable information. &nbsp;Those employees are required to respect the
confidentiality of our visitor's personal data.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733454">Acceptable Use</a></h2>

<p>This section applies to the software systems and all related
electronic or printed Help and documentation accessed via the Sites
("Software"). </p>

<p>Users are granted nonexclusive, nontransferable permission
to access and display the Software on their computer screens and to generate
outputs from the Software as designed and intended per descriptions in the Software's
relevant documentation.&nbsp; Users acknowledge that DDI will not be liable or held
at fault for any performance or operational problems resulting from
non-conformance to the published technical specifications necessary for access
to the Software. &nbsp;&nbsp;DDI shall not be liable or held to be in default of
performance or operational obligations due to any technical or design problem
within the electronic network which compromises users' access to the public
Internet.</p>

<p>Neither the Software nor the hard-copy outputs generated
from the Software may be used by or disclosed to third parties except as may be
required in connection with inquiries by government or regulatory authorities.</p>

<p>Except as expressly authorized herein, users shall not: (i)
copy the Software in whole or in part; (ii) reverse compile, reverse assemble,
or access with intent to "hack" all or any portion of the Software;
(iii) distribute, market, rent, lease, provide access to, or transfer the
Software to third parties; or (iv) modify the Software except as otherwise
provided. No license, right, or interest in any DDI trademark, trade name, or
service mark is granted hereunder. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733455">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating PII</a></h2>

<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes
(such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer
desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate
users' personally identifiable information as noted below. </p>

<p>Contact the technical support staff via eMail or phone as
designated on the site. We will respond to your request within 30 days of
receiving the request. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733456">Changes to the Privacy Statement</a></h2>

<p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement.&nbsp; When we
do, we will post those changes on the Sites, and other places we deem
appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how
we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. </p>

<p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally
identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of
collection we will notify users by posting a notice on the Sites for 30 days. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733457">Protection of Children's Information</a></h2>

<p>The Sites do not publish content or collect data that is
directed at children. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733458">Complaints Resolution</a></h2>

<p>If you are concerned about how your personal information is
being used, you have a right to complain and to expect your complaint to be handled
in a sensitive and effective manner.&nbsp; At any time, you can contact us to
inquire about the handling, use or disclosure of your personal information by
sending an email to the persons listed under Contact Information.&nbsp; We will
investigate your complaint and advise you of the outcome of the investigation
in a timely manner. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733460">Use Guidelines and Rules</a></h2>

<p>You agree not to use the Internet Sites to send or post in
the forums or any place on the Internet Sites any message or material that (a)
is unlawful, harassing, defamatory, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar,
obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, racially offensive,

such material from the Internet Sites.</p>

<p>You agree not to post or use the Internet Sites to

<h2><a name="_Toc248733464">Profiles</a></h2>

<p>Information provided by users of the Sites is stored in a
user profile.&nbsp; Subsequently collected information related to that user profile
that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or third parties is tied to the
profile to improve the content of the site for the user.&nbsp; This profile is used
to tailor a user’s visit to the Sites and to direct pertinent content to them.</p>

<p>We purchase third party marketing data and add it to our
existing user database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent
information we think our users would be interested in.&nbsp; We use this information
to enhance or overlay the `profile' of individual users.&nbsp; This aggregate
marketing data is therefore tied to the users' personally identifiable
information.</p>

<p>We do not share your profile with other third parties.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733465">Widgets</a></h2>

<p>Widgets support functions that require that you disclose
certain personally identifiable information given the user's choice of
participation. This information is collected in many different ways such as:
forms, surveys, contests, forums, subscribing or unsubscribing to mailings and
correcting or updating personally identifiable information and are only used
for the purpose in which they were collected. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733466">Blogs, Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public
Forums</a></h2>

<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose
personal information online - for example on blogs, message boards, through
email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.
In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible,
you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>

<p>We are not responsible for the personally identifiable
information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc248733467">Information Use</a></h2>

submitted by you.&nbsp; Once DDI receives such information, it is sent to the
particular office at DDI that is equipped to respond to your request or
comment. We do not rent, sell, or exchange information about you to third
parties, except as otherwise noted in this privacy statement.</p>

<p>DDI may also use such information to provide advance notice
