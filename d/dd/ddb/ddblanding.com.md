The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of your personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Article 6(1) of the GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of your personal data may be necessary to protect your vital interests or of another natural person, e.g., if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Such processing would be based on Article 6(1) of the GDPR.
