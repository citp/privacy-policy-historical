or both. If you do not wish to provide such information to the Site, you may be unable to use certain
features of the Site, register with the Site or obtain certain products from the Site.
Dorman may place Internet “cookies” on your hard drive. Internet cookies are small amounts of data that
contain a unique identifier that many web sites frequently send to your web browser to be stored on your
computer’s hard drive in order to save data about you, such as your name, password, user-name, screen
preferences, and the pages of a site you have viewed. When you revisit the Site, Dorman may recognize
you by your Internet cookies and customize your experience accordingly. You may decline Internet
cookies by using the appropriate feature of your Web browser software, if available.
Dorman may also use Web bugs to gather, store, and track certain information related to your visit to and
activity on the Site. A Web “bug” is a file object, which can be a graphic image such as a transparent one
pixel-by-one pixel graphics file, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user
activity. A Web bug can gather, for example, the IP address of your computer, the time the Web page
was viewed, and the type of browser used. When a user performs a search within the Site, Dorman may
record information identifying the user or linking the user or to the search performed and recording
information related to the search request.
Dorman may use Google Analytics or a similar service to gather, store, and track certain information
related to your visit to and activity on the Site. When a user performs a search within the Site, Dorman
may record information identifying the user or linking the user to the search performed and recording
information related to the search request.
2.        Use of Personal Information Collected. Personal information collected by Dorman may be
used by Dorman for many reasons, for example, for recordkeeping, editorial and feedback purposes,
marketing and promotional purposes, statistical analysis of users’ behavior, product development, content
improvement, or to customize the content and layout of the Site. Aggregate data on users’ home servers
may be used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-
mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which users voluntarily provide to
Dorman may be added to Dorman’s databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding Site
updates, new products and services, and upcoming events.


From time to time, we may need to contact you for customer-related activities. You agree that we may
use your personal information for such customer-related contacts with you. We may also desire to contact
you for market research purposes or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of
particular interest. You will have the option of not being contacted by Dorman and opting-out of such
contacts by setting the appropriate option in your profile or unsubscribing to such correspondence.
Without limiting the foregoing, Dorman has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any and all
communications posted to the Site, including through Distributor features and other general areas of the
Site. Such voluntary information posted by you may be collected and used by Company in accordance
with this Privacy Statement.

legal process, in response to a request by or on behalf of any local, state, federal, or other government
agency, department, or body, whether or not pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal
process, or if determined by Dorman in its sole judgment that such disclosure or distribution is appropriate
to protect the life, health, or property of Dorman or any other person or entity.
