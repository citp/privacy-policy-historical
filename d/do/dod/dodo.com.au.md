PRIVACY POLICY
The Dodo Group (Dodo, we us, our) comprises Dodo Australia Hold-
ings Pty Ltd, Dodo Group Services Pty Ltd, Dodo Insurance Pty Ltd, M2
Energy Pty Ltd (trading as Dodo Power & Gas) and Dodo Services Pty Ltd
and Secureway Pty Ltd. The Dodo companies are members of the M2
Group, being wholly owned subsidiaries of M2 Group Ltd.
Dodo provides internet, mobile, telephone, electricity and gas, insur-
ance products and services, and alarm monitoring, predominately to
residential customers. Dodo is committed to protecting the privacy and
personal information of its customers. This Privacy Policy describes the
practices and processes Dodo has in place to properly manage and safe-
guard that information.
PRIVACY LAWS THAT APPLY TO DODO
Dodo is required to comply with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and is bound
by the Australian Privacy Principles (‘APPs’) set out in that Act. The APPs
establish minimum standards for the collection, use, disclosure and
handling of personal information. They apply to personal information
in any form, including electronic and digital form. The APPs can be ac-
cessed at the website of the office of the Australian Information Com-
missioner: www.privacy.gov.au.
Dodo is also subject to other laws relating to the protection of personal
information. Where Dodo provides telecommunications carriage ser-
vices, it is subject to privacy obligations under the Telecommunications
Act 1997 (Cth). Where Dodo provides electricity and gas, Dodo may be
subject to requirements relating to the privacy of retail customer infor-
mation. Dodo’s direct marketing activities must also comply with the Do
Not Call Register Act 2006 (Cth) and the Spam Act 2010 (Cth). If Dodo
collects health information, it may be required to comply with statutory
requirements relating to health records.
In this Privacy Policy, unless the context otherwise requires:
•   ‘Privacy Law’ refers to any legislative or other legal requirement that
    applies to Dodo’s collection, use, disclosure or handling of personal
    information.
•   ‘Personal information’ means information or an opinion about an
    identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable,
    whether the information or opinion is true or not and whether the
    information or opinion is recorded in material form or not. Personal
    information includes sensitive information.
•   ‘Sensitive information’ means personal information about an indi-
    vidual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or memberships,
    religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, professional or
    trade association/union memberships, sexual preferences and prac-
    tices or criminal record.
WHY DOES DODO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Dodo collects personal information in order to:
•   manage and administer the products and services we provide,
    including for billing and credit control purposes;
•   inform customers about changes and improvements in Dodo prod-
    ucts and services;
1.


•   market Dodo products and services to current and prospective cus-
    tomers;
•   market third party products and services to current and prospective
    customers; and
•   comply with our legal obligations.
Dodo needs to be able to collect personal information for most of its
business activities, although the information we require depends on
the particular circumstances. If we are unable to collect the personal
information we need, we may be unable to meet the expectations of our
customers or provide the products and services they wish to receive.
WHOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES DODO
COLLECT?
Dodo collects or holds personal information about individuals who are:
•   Prospective customers. This includes people we think may be inter-
    ested in our products and services as well as people who have ex-
    pressed interest in obtaining or learning more about those products
    and services.
•   Current customers. This includes people who purchase Dodo prod-
    ucts or services or who hold an account with Dodo.
•   Past customers. These are people who have purchased Dodo prod-
    ucts or services but do not currently hold any active Dodo account.
Dodo may treat current and past customers as prospective customers
for other Dodo products and services.
Dodo may collect personal information about associates of its custom-
ers, such as family members, employees or agents. For example, Dodo
may collect personal information about nominated or authorised repre-
sentatives, the holder of a credit card that is used to pay a customer’s
account, a person who acts as a secondary account holder, a person
who acts as guarantor for a credit contract, the landlord of a tenanted
property or the nominated contact on a business account.
Dodo may in rare circumstances collect personal information from
people who are under the age of 18. If Dodo does this, Dodo may also
collect personal information about the parent or guardian of that
person.
Dodo also collects personal information about all the individuals who
are involved in providing Dodo products and services. This includes:
•   staff of Dodo Group entities and other companies in the M2 group;
    and
•   service providers and suppliers, agents and affiliates, and their staff.
CAN YOU DEAL WITH DODO WITHOUT IDENTIFYING
YOURSELF?
In some limited situations customers and other individuals may be able
to deal with Dodo anonymously or using a pseudonym. For example, if
you make a general inquiry to one of our call centres, or want to make a
complaint or log a service fault unless the inquiry or complaint relates
to a particular account.
However, if you do not wish to be identified we may not be able to
provide the information or assistance you require.
                                                                          2.


WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES DODO USUALLY
COLLECT?
Dodo collects a wide range of personal information about its custom-
ers, but the type and amount of information collected depends on the
particular business context. However, Dodo seeks at all times to ensure
that it only collects the personal information that is necessary for the
purposes of its business activities.
Dodo needs to collect basic identifying and contact information for all
customers, including prospective customers. This will usually include
name, date of birth, email address, telephone number(s) and residential
address. For corporate and business customers, Dodo collects infor-
mation about nominated contacts, including name and title or position,
date of birth, telephone number(s) and email and business addresses.
Dodo also collects information about purchasing patterns, consumer
preferences and attitudes from prospective and current customers for
marketing purposes, including to analyse markets, develop marketing
strategies and to identify and develop products and services that may
be of interest to its customers.
When you become, or apply to become, a Dodo customer, Dodo collects
a range of other information that that it needs to assess your application
and manage your account(s). This includes:
•   Proof of identity information, including passport number, driver
    licence number or other government identifiers. We need this infor-
    mation to ensure our customer records are accurate and up-to-date.
    We also may be required to obtain proof of identity information by
    law. For example, we are required under the Telecommunications Act
    1997 to obtain specified proof of identity information before provid-
    ing certain mobile telephone services.
•   Financial and credit information, including credit history, employ-
    ment history, remuneration details, bank account and credit card
    information, information about assets and income and details of rel-
    evant court judgments and bankruptcies. We need this information
    to assess creditworthiness and financial suitability of current and
    prospective customers.
•   Information about medical conditions and concession entitle-
    ment. We need this information to assess eligibility for concessional
    tariffs or other benefits that may be available with Dodo products or
    services. For example, in the case of electricity and gas, we may need
    information about medical conditions to ensure secure power supply
    for medical devices.
•   Information relating to occupancy. We may need information
    to establish that a customers has rights to occupy the property to
    which we provide services, and for this purpose may require copies
    of tenancy agreements, mortgage records or utility bills or supply
    records.
•   Information relating to change of name or status, which may
    include marriage certificates, death certificates and other official
    documentation. We may need this information where we are asked
    to close or transfer an account.
•   Employment information, including information about employ-
    ment history including current and past employers. We may need
    this information to assess the financial position of a person who
    applies to become a Dodo customer.
•   Insurance information. In providing insurance products and ser-
    vices, we may need to collect information we need to assess the risks
    of providing insurance, including information relating to pre-existing
    conditions, claims history and previous insurance.
3.


•   Integrated Public Number Database (IPND). In providing tele-
    communications services, Dodo is required by law to collect certain
    personal information about you, including your name, address, tele-
    phone service number and other public number customer details,
    and to provide it to the operator of the IPND) for inclusion in the
    IPND. Information in the IPND is used to develop directories and to
    assist emergency service organisations. If your phone number is un-
    listed, your information will be marked accordingly in the IPND and
    its use and disclosure will be strictly controlled.
We also collect information about the way our customers use Dodo
products and services. This includes information about:
•   service usage (including energy consumption patterns, use of com-
    munications services, internet usages);
•   responses to offers made and/or promotions run by Dodo or its affil-
    iates;
•   payment patterns and history; and
•   inquiries and complaints.
We collect information about our employees and prospective employ-
ees for the purpose of making employment decisions and managing our
staff. We also collect information about suppliers, service providers,
agents and affiliates, and their staff, for the purposes of conducting our
day-to-day business activities.
HOW DOES DODO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We collect personal information by various means and via various
media, depending on the particular business context.
We collect information about prospective customers both directly and
via our agents, service providers and affiliates. We may collect this in-
formation:
•   when you make an inquiry at a Dodo kiosk, Dodo dealer or Dodo
    event;
•   through our door to door sales activities;
•   through our call centres;
•   through Dodo websites, or websites operated by Dodo’s affiliates;
•   through social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook; and
•   through the purchase of marketing lists, databases and data aggre-
    gation services.
When you become or apply to become a Dodo customer, in addition to
collecting personal information directly from you, we may also collect
information about you from our agents and affiliates, credit reporting
agencies, your past and present employers, current service providers,
family members or associates and other third parties.
When you apply to become a Dodo customer, we will ask you to consent
to us collecting information from particular third parties. We will only
collect personal information from those parties if you consent. If you do
not consent, we may not be able to provide the service or product you
require. We are authorised to collect some personal information from
third parties under Privacy Law.
Dodo receives unsolicited personal information from time to time. In
accordance with its obligations under Privacy Law, Dodo will decide
whether it would have been permitted to solicit and collect that infor-
mation and if it would not have been, will destroy or de-identify the in-
formation (provided it is lawful to do so).
                                                                         4.


WHAT INFORMATION WILL DODO GIVE YOU WHEN IT
COLLECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Dodo is required by Privacy Law to take reasonable steps to ensure that
you are made aware of certain information when it collects personal
information about you. For example, we are required to:
•   tell you which Dodo entity you are dealing with and how to contact it;
•   make sure you are aware that we have collected the information (if
    we collect it from a third party without your knowledge);
•   identify any law that authorises or requires collection of the informa-
    tion;
•   let you know the purposes for which we collect the information, the
    entities that the information is likely to be disclosed to and whether
    the information will be transferred outside Australia; and
•   tell you how to access our Privacy Policy and complaint handling pro-
    cedures.
This Privacy Policy sets out this information in general terms. However,
where we collect personal information in relation to a particular product
or service, and the information we are required to provide is not likely
to be obvious from the circumstances, we usually provide the required
information in a ‘collection statement’. The way we do this will depend
on how you are dealing with us. For example:
•   When personal information is collected via the Dodo website or any
    affiliate website that Dodo may advertise on, a statement is displayed
    or a link provided to a statement that sets out the information we are
    required to provide.
•   A statement containing the required information is printed on the
    sign-up page of most of the standard forms we use to collect person-
    al information.
•   When you deal with us on the telephone, this information is given to
    you by the operator or via a recorded message.
If we collect personal information about you from a third party, we take
reasonable steps to ensure you receive the information we are required
to provide. However, we may do this by requiring the third party to
provide the information, rather than us providing the information to you
directly.
We may also include information about our collection of personal infor-
mation in welcome packs, customer account statements, update bulle-
tins, notices and other documents we give to our customers.
DODO’S USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL
INFORMATION
Where Dodo collects personal information for a particular purpose,
it may use and disclose the information for that purpose or another
purpose that is related to that purpose (or that is directly related to that
purpose in the case of sensitive information). For example:

    lishing or managing an account may be used and disclosed for related
    purposes such as identity verification, credit checking, assessing
    entitlement to concessions, supplying and servicing a product, con-
    necting and administering a service, billing and collection in relation
    to the service and investigating and rectifying complaints or faults.

•   Dodo will not use sensitive information for direct marketing purpos-
    es without your consent.

    obtain your consent, Dodo will not use your personal information for
    direct marketing purposes where we have obtained the personal in-
    formation from a third party, or we have collected it directly from you
    but believe that you would not reasonably expect the information to

    marketing communications from Dodo.

•   Database and webhosting services provided to Dodo involve per-
    sonal information being transferred to IT service providers based

HOW DOES DODO PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL
INFORMATION?
Dodo recognises the importance of protecting your personal informa-
tion and of ensuring that it is complete, accurate, up-to-date and rele-
vant.
When you call Dodo, we complete an ID check to verify your identity and
to check the details we hold about you are correct and to update them
if required. For some safety critical information, for example medical
information required to maintain secure power supply or ensure priority
assistance, we initiate checks on an annual basis.
We have documented processes for verifying personal information col-
lected for particular transactions, such as proof of occupancy, change of
occupier and priority assistance. Our staff are trained to properly handle
the different types of information they receive, particularly sensitive in-
formation. We have quality assurance measures in place to monitor calls
to ensure that our processes are being followed.
While some of the personal information we collect is held in hardcopy
form, most personal information is stored in electronic databases.
We have extensive processes in place to ensure that our information
systems and files are kept secure from unauthorised access and inter-
ference. These include:
•   System access is controlled by logins and different security levels.
    Access to customer information for all staff (including agents in our
    Manila call centre) is centrally controlled. Access requests must be
    supported by a request from senior management.
•   Access authorisation is layered and access authorisations are specif-
    ic to the job function of each staff member. For example, staff with
    responsibility for fault management have no access to credit card
    information. Staff are only trained in areas of the system specific to
    the function of their job.
•   Functional restrictions apply. Remote access is only available to se-
    lected senior staff members. Measures are taken to prevent printing,
    copying or recording of customer information that can be accessed
    electronically. For example, call centre team members work in a pa-
    perless environment, cannot print information and are not permit-
    ted to have mobile phones or cameras on the call centre floor.
                                                                          8.


•   Account and system access and modification is logged to enable
    access or modification of any customer record by any staff member
    to be identified. Audits of access logs are conducted periodically.
•   Our employees undergo privacy and information security training on
    induction and are required to sign acknowledgements of their obli-
    gations in relation information security and appropriate use of our IT
    systems.
•   We have contractual arrangements in place with our agents, service
    providers and affiliates that require them to have comply with ap-
    plicable privacy laws and Dodo privacy policies. Our contractual
    arrangements with third parties who are outside Australia are de-
    signed to ensure that personal information transferred to those
    parties is afforded the same level of protection as would apply to the
    information in Australia.
CAN YOU ACCESS OR CORRECT PERSONAL
INFORMATION DODO HOLDS ABOUT YOU?
You have a right to access personal information we hold about you.
If your request is particularly complex or requires detailed searching of
our records, there may be a cost to you in order for us to provide you
with this information.
If you believe there are errors in the information we hold about you, you
have a right to ask us to correct the information.
However, we are not required to provide access where we believe doing
so would:
•   prejudice law enforcement or crime prevention activities;
•   pose a serious threat to health or safety;
•   have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals;
•   prejudice Dodo in legal proceedings or negotiations with you;
•   reveal information connected with a commercially sensitive decision
    making process; or
•   be contrary to law.
If you wish to have access to information Dodo holds about you, you
should contact Dodo Customer Service.
