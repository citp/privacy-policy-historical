<p><span>DirectoryOfEzines.com </span><span>would like to assure you that we <strong>do not</strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span><span>collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us, or</span></li>

<p><span>We collect information from online visitors who ask to be on our newsletter mailing list and/or receive periodic email announcements. All online visitor data collected by DirectoryOfEzines.com is protected against unauthorized access.</span></p>
<p>Anyone who wishes can choose to be removed from our mailing list at any time.</p>
<p><span>In addition, online visitors who wish to purchase a membership through our Web site must provide their name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card number and expiration date.&nbsp; </span><span>The information collected is used only to process your request quickly and accurately. </span><span>All credit card transactions occur over a secure connection.&nbsp; We do not store credit card numbers on our servers and use third party services for payment processing and shopping cart services.&nbsp; T</span><span>o confirm that your connection is secure, look for the image of a lock or key on the bottom bar of your browser window.&nbsp; If the lock is closed or the key appears whole, then you are viewing a secure page.&nbsp; Otherwise, the lock may appear as open or the key appear as broken.</span></p>
<p>All personal and financial information submitted during the purchase process is encrypted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will not sell, trade, or give your personal information to other companies or organizations.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></span></p>
<p><span>DirectoryOfEzines.com </span><span>does not</span><span> </span><span>knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. DirectoryOfEzines.com encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:</span></p>
<p><span>Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.&nbsp; This includes name, address, phone, school, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.</span></p>
