practices and policies set forth in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby acknowledge and consent to our collection,
use, and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

to the following:
</p><ul>
<li>Your name, current address, age group, email address, telephone/cell phone number and fax number;</li>

<li>Any personal correspondence, which includes emails</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
Other information you provide is not required by us but may assist with responding to your request more effectively.
<p></p>
<h2>Why Do We Collect Personal Information?</h2>
<p>Dot &amp; Bo offers various products and services to our Customers and also strives to meet the needs of our
Customers. We use your Personal Information for internal purposes such as tracking your order, analyzing your
preferences, and noting trends and statistics. To do this effectively, we need to collect certain Personal
Information.</p>
<h2>The Personal Information We Collect From You</h2>
<p>All Personal Information we collect from you requires your consent, for example, opening an account, purchase
and delivery of products, special offers, etc. We may request your consent from time to time to take part in improved
product performance or for marketing purposes that we think will be useful to you. However, unless you are informed
otherwise, the Personal Information we hold is for establishing and managing our business and customer relationship
with you. Sensitive information is subject to greater restrictions and governed by law.</p>
<p>By communicating with Dot &amp; Bo, including by email and by completing online forms, you are giving your
consent to the collection of what Personal Information you provide.</p>
<p>You have the right to anonymity and do not have to supply us with information. However, if you choose not to
provide the information and we need to fulfill your request for a specific product, we may be unable to provide you
with that requested product.</p>
<h2>Keeping a Record of Personal Information</h2>
<p>Depending on the product you have acquired, it may be necessary to keep a record of the transaction for business
purposes or to enable us to respond to your concerns.</p>
<p>We may hold Personal Information for the following purposes:
</p><ul>
<li>Internal accounting and administration;</li>
<li>To supply you with information about your account including regular statements;</li>
<li>To respond to inquiries;</li>
<li>Enhancing customer service, product options and to improve product performance;</li>
<li>Promotions, competition entry forms, redemption vouchers, and special offers where you voluntarily supplied
your personal details;</li>
<li>To administer sales records;</li>
<li>To provide information about us, our products, services and special offers; and</li>
<li>To analyze our website usage.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Occasionally we require organizations outside Dot &amp; Bo to provide a service for purposes, which are
necessary for us to conduct our business, functions and activities (for example advertising names of competition
winners and delivering products). We take all steps to ensure these organizations both inside and outside of the
United States deal with Personal Information according to this Policy.</p>
<h2>Our Disclosure of Your Information/Security</h2>
<p>Although Dot &amp; Bo uses industry standard practices to protect your Personal Information, due to technical
limitations, WE DO NOT REPRESENT, WARRANT AND/OR GUARANTEE THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WILL REMAIN SECURE. Therefore, we

always remain private. Notwithstanding this, as a matter of policy, we NEVER sell or rent any Personal Information
about you to any third party.</p>
<p>The following describes some of the ways that your Personal Information may be disclosed and you expressly agree
that your Personal Information may be disclosed by Dot &amp; Bo in the following ways:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Advertisers</b>. We may internally gather data across all of our Website's visitors and keep a record of
your usage habits. As a result, we may disclose some limited, non-specific Personal Information to third parties for
marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any
information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, email address,
address and telephone number are NEVER disclosed to advertisers.</li>
<li><b>Cookies</b>. When you visit the Website, our server may attach a small data file known as a "cookie" to
your hard drive. This enables us to analyze usage patterns on our Website in order to tailor it to our users' needs.
Cookies are safe and cannot be used to deliver a virus. Cookies only identify your computer to our servers when you
visit our Website. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. If you do not wish to accept cookies, you can refuse
the transfer of cookies to your computer's hard drive by adjusting your Internet browser. Without accepting a Cookie,
you can browse through our site, but you will be unable to establish a shopping cart session and make a purchase
on-line.</li>
<li><b>Legal Requests</b>. Dot &amp; Bo may lawfully disclose your Personal Information for law enforcement or
regulatory purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>How We Manage Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>You may have contact with us personally, by telephone, mail, over the Internet or other electronic medium. We
take all reasonable steps to keep your Personal Information secure in a combination of secure computer storage, hard
copy files and other records. We take steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss,
unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. You have the right to access the Personal Information you have
provided to us. If you require details of your Personal Information held by us, we will need to verify your identity
before meeting your request, which we will process in a reasonable time. If you find that the information we hold
about you is inaccurate or out of date then we will promptly correct it upon receipt of the changes from you.</p>
<p>As far as permissible under law, Dot &amp; Bo accepts no responsibility for the unauthorized access of Personal
Information held by Dot &amp; Bo.</p>

under 13. The Dot &amp; Bo Network is not directed at children under 13, and does not knowingly collect any personal
information from children under 13.</p>
<h2>Changes to Our Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>
From time to time, it may be necessary for us to review and revise our privacy statement. We reserve the right to
change our privacy statement at any time and to notify you by publishing an updated version of the policy on the Dot
&amp; Bo website at <a href="http://www.dotandbo.com" style="color: red">www.dotandbo.com</a>.
