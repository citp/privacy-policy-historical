  <h2 class="Title">Dotster Privacy Policy</h2>

DOTSTER PRIVACY STATEMENT
<br>
This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Dotster, Inc. 
Dotster respects your privacy. Our purpose in collecting information from you is to help us provide you with better
service, such as notifications about special offers and promotions. We will not willfully disclose any individually
identifiable information about you to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this
privacy statement.  Dotster does not collect individually identifiable information from any end-user.  Furthermore, we
do not specifically target children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect, without parental consent,
individually identifiable information from such. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your
privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices available for review. 
<br><br>
Information Collection and Use
<br><br>
Dotster is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information
to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  Dotster collects information from our users at
several different points on our website.
<br><br>
Registration
<br>
In order to register a domain name on this website, a user must complete the registration process.  During registration
a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address).  This information is used to
contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.  It is optional for the user to
provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security
number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.  
<br><br>
Order
<br>
We request information from the user on our order form.  Here a user must provide contact information (like name and
shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for
billing purposes and to fill customer's orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is
used to get in touch with the user.
<br><br>
Cookies
<br><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is
in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  Once the user closes their browser, the
cookie simply terminates.  For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password
more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.  The
only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, the user will not be
able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that take place. Cookies can also enable us
to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
<br><br>
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or
control over these cookies.
<br><br>
Log Files
<br><br>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic
information for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
Sharing
<br><br>
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal
information that can identify any individual person.
<br><br>
We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share,
store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
<br><br>
We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share
names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.
These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these
services.
<br><br>
Links
<br><br>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we [DOTSTER] are not responsible for the privacy
practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy
statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies
solely to information collected by this Web site.
<br><br>
Newsletter
<br>
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. 
<br><br>
Surveys &amp; Contests
<br><br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or
contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information
(such as zip code, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey
information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
<br><br>
Tell-A-Friend
<br><br>
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's
name and email address. DOTSTER will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.
DOTSTER stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  The friend may contact [DOTSTER] at
csupport@dotster.com to request the removal of this information from their database.
<br><br>
Security
<br><br>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the
website, the information is protected both online and off-line.
<br><br>
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social
security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry -
SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.
<br><br>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect
user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is
restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing
clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Our employees
must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their
password to re-gain access to your information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and
privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or
reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is
protected.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment,
behind a locked cage.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to security@dotster.com.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Supplementation of Information
<br><br>
In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the
information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.
<br><br>
For example, to determine if our customers qualify for a dotPartner open account, we use their name and business
information to request a credit report.  Once we determine a user's credit-worthiness, this document is destroyed. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
Special Offers
<br><br>
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive
information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we
present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.
<br><br>
Site and Service Updates
<br><br>
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service
announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested
services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.
<br><br>
Correction/Updating Personal Information:
<br><br>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our
service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.  This
can usually be done under account management or by emailing our Customer Support.  
<br><br>
Choice/Opt-out
<br><br>
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to
our site at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users
who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.  
<br><br>
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials Dotster and its partners may opt-out of
receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at
dotnews@dotster.com.  
<br><br>
Notification of Changes
<br><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Home page so our users are always aware of
what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide
to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will
notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this
different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was
collected. 
<br><br>
-----------
<br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. Our third-party advertising company
also separately places or recognizes a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to this
Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about
your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
