Importantly, (i) where we use the term “client” we are referring to the entity in contract with us to use the dotmailer services; (ii) where we use the term “you” we are referring to visitors to our website [www.dotmailer.com](https://www.dotmailer.com/) or [www.dotdigitalgroup.com](https://www.dotdigitalgroup.com/) or clients using the dotmailer services; (iii) where we use the term “end-user” we are referring to a person contacted through your use of the dotmailer services, someone that you may contact in the future using the dotmailer services, or any individual whose information you provide to us in your use of the dotmailer service. 

### Contents

### Who we are

dotmailer (including dotmailer Limited (based in the UK), dotmailer, Inc. (based in the US) and dotmailer Pty Ltd (based in Australia)) collects, uses and is responsible for certain personal information about you. 

When we do so we are regulated under the General Data Protection Regulation which applies across the European Union (including in the United Kingdom) and we are responsible as ‘controller’ of that personal information for the purposes of those laws. 

In connection with personal data provided through your use of the dotmailer platform and other services that we provide, we are a ‘processor’ for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation. 

As some dotmailer affiliates are based outside of the European Economic Area, and these affiliates have appointed dotmailer Limited to be our representative within the EEA as necessary. Contact details are available 

### The personal information we collect and use

**Information you provide voluntarily**  
In the course of signing up for and using the dotmailer services, consulting with our support teams, sending us an email, connecting another account with the dotmailer services (e.g. using one of our connectors), or communicating with us in any way, you are voluntarily giving us information that we collect. That information may include either your or your end-users’ name, email address, IP address, phone number, postal address, in addition to other details that may include gender, location, occupation or other information of a demographic nature. In supplying this information, you consent to this information being collected, used, disclosed, transferred to dotmailer affiliates and stored by us, as described in our Terms and this Privacy Policy.

**Information we automatically collect**  
When you browse one of our websites, use the dotmailer platform or interact with an email that we send to you, we may collect information about your web browsing and use of the site or platform. This may include details of your operating system, location, IP address, browser ID, browsing activity, and other information about how you interacted with dotmailer’s services. We may collect this information as a part of log files as well as through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies. We use this information to help improve the website or monitor the performance of our campaigns.

Both dotmailer and our third party partners may use assorted technologies to collect and store information when you use the dotmailer platform or visit our website or interact with an email from us. This may include using cookies and similar tracking technologies (e.g. pixels and web beacons) to analyse behaviour, track movements around the website, provide targeted advertisements, and gather demographic information. We partner with third parties to display advertising on our website or to manage and supply our advertising on other sites. These partners may use cookies or other tracking methods in order to provide you content or advertisements based upon your browsing activities and interests. You are able to control the use of cookies at an individual browser level. Please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://www.dotmailer.com/terms/cookie-policy/) for more information.

**Information through the dotmailer platform**  
We also obtain personal information from your use of the dotmailer platform. When you upload end-user data in the dotmailer platform, we may have access to the data and content of your messages. We receive information about how you use the dotmailer platform and store it in log files or other types of files associated to your account and link it to other information we hold about you. This information might include the date and date of any activity, your browser and IP address as well as actions you have taken within the dotmailer platform. This information helps us to improve the dotmailer platform for you for all users of the platform. 

**Information from elsewhere**  
dotmailer may obtain information about you or end-users from third parties, such as public databases, social media platforms, third party data providers and our marketing partners. Examples of the information we may receive from other sources include device information (e.g. IP address and browser), location, behavioural data and demographic information. We may use this information, alone or in combination with other information described above, to develop or provide more relevant platform features or services (e.g. social media data of end-users allowing you to send more relevant content) or provide more relevant marketing and content to you. 

**Public information & third-party sites**  
dotmailer websites include social media features (either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website), which may collect information about your IP address and which page you are visiting. The feature may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. We also maintain presences on social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Your interactions with these platforms are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them. Anything you submit to dotmailer via a social media platform is done so at your own risk without any expectation of privacy. 

Further, any comments or information you supply on any blog that dotmailer operates can be read, used or collected by anyone. If your information appears in our blog pages and you want it removed, contact our Marketing team: [marketing@dotmailer.com.](mailto:marketing@dotmailer.com)

Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy policy. We accept no responsibility or liability for such other websites. You should exercise caution when entering personal information online and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

When using the dotmailer platform, you may import end-user or other personal information you have collected into our system.
