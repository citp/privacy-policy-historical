# Dots : Privacy Policy

At Dots.com, we believe that the best way to protect our customers on the Internet is to inform them about what we are doing. Consequently, we've tried here to answer a few of your questions and concerns as honestly as we can. This policy describes the personal information we collect about you, why we collect it, how we use it, and when we share it with third parties. Our policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information. If we missed a direct concern of yours or if you just want to talk to us, please feel free to call us at 1-877-874-2674 or e-mail us through our comment form. Please take a moment to read our Privacy Policy, and thank you for visiting our Web site. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post the change on this page or, in the case of children under the age of 13, seek to obtain parental consent. In the event that we make a material change in our privacy practices with respect to children, we will first obtain verifiable parental consent before using any previously collected personal information in the new manner.
