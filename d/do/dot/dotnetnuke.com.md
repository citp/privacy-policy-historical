5\.  Our Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, Web Analytics Services, and Links

  * Cookies. Many of our web pages use “cookies.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences.

Our Company cannot control these links and we are not responsible for any content appearing on these sites.

Privacy Shield Statement

The DNN Corp. (“DNN”) complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.  DNN has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>   

This Privacy Statement outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including the types of information we gather, how we use it and the notice and choice affected individuals have regarding our use of and their ability to correct that information.

A) Definitions

“Personal Data” means information that (1)is transferred from the EU/EEA or Switzerland to the United States; (2) is recorded in any form; (3) is about, or pertains to a specific individual; and (4) can be linked to that individual.

“Sensitive Personal Information” means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or that concerns an individual’s health.

B) Principles

DNN may receive Personal Data from its own personnel as well as from its affiliates and other parties located in the EU/EEA or Switzerland. Such information may contain, but is not limited to name (fist and last name), position,  address, email address, phone number, login credentials, human resources data and transaction information and may be about customers, clients of customers, business partners, acquisition targets, potential buyers consultants, employees, and candidates for employment and includes information recorded on various media as well as electronic data.

Other than its own human resources data, DNN generally does not collect Personal Data directly from individuals. DNN, however, acting as a data processor may receive Personal Data via its customers. DNN executes data processing agreements with such customers which set out the parties’ obligations and responsibilities to comply with the Principles. DNN will cooperate with its customers to enable them to comply with the Principles, to the extent a Principle is applicable to DNN

Whenever DNN processes Personal Data, DNN complies with the Principles (as each Principle is applicable to DNN’s role):

1\. Notice. We shall inform an individual of the purpose for which we collect and use their Personal Data and the types of third parties to which DNN discloses or may disclose that Personal Data. DNN shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Data.  Please refer to our main Privacy Policy Statement for more information regarding our data handling practices.  Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Data to DNN, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before DNN uses or discloses the Personal Data for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. DNN may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

2\. Choice. Individuals have the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Data is (1) to be disclosed to a non-Agent third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual by contacting our Data Protection Officer via email at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) For Sensitive Personal Information, DNN will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-Agent third party or for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. DNN shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information.  Agents, technology vendors and/or contractors of DNN or affiliated companies may have access to an individual’s Personal Data on a need to know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of DNN or providing or enabling elements of the services. All such agents, technology vendors and contractors who have access to such information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for DNN or as otherwise required by law.

3\. Accountability for Onward Transfer. Prior to disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we shall notify the individual of such disclosure and allow the individual the choice (opt out) of such disclosure. DNN shall ensure that any third party to which Personal Data may be disclosed agrees in writing to provide the same level of privacy protection as set forth in this policy. 

The DNN’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, DNN remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless DNN proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

5\. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation. We shall only process Personal Data in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, DNN shall take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

6\. Access. Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States.  Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you.  You may also may correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you.  An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under Privacy Shield, should direct their query to [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)  If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

7\. Enforcement and Dispute Resolution. With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, DNN is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, DNN commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact us at:

a. Human Resources Data. If your complaint involves human resources data transferred to the United States from the EU and/or Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship, and DNN does not address it satisfactorily, DNN commits to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPA Panel) and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, as applicable and to comply with the advice given by the DPA panel and/or Commissioner, as applicable with regard to such human resources data.  To pursue an unresolved human resources complaint, you should contact the state or national data protection or labor authority in the appropriate jurisdiction.

b. Non-Human Resources Data. DNN has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.

This service is provided free of charge to you.  

If your Privacy Shield complaint was not resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.  See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at <https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction>

C) Amendments

This Privacy Statement may be amended from time to time consistent with the requirements of the Shield Frameworks. We will post any revised policy on this website.
