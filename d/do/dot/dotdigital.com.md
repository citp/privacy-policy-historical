## Who we are  
  
dotdigital (including dotmailer Limited (based in the UK), dotmailer, Inc. (based in the US) and dotmailer Pty Ltd (based in Australia)) collects, uses and is responsible for certain personal information about you.  
When we do so we are regulated under the General Data Protection Regulation which applies across the European Union (including in the United Kingdom) and we are responsible as ‘controller’ of that personal information for the purposes of those laws.  
In connection with personal data provided through your use of the Engagement Cloud platform and other services that we provide, we are a ‘processor’ for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation.   
As some dotdigital affiliates are based outside of the European Economic Area, and these affiliates have appointed dotmailer Limited to be our representative within the EEA as necessary. Contact details are available
