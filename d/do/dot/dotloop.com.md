# Our Privacy Policy | Dotloop

## Our Commitment to Privacy

This Privacy Policy applies to [dotloop.wpengine.com](http://dotloop.wpengine.com/) operated by Dotloop, LLC (“Dotloop”, “We”, “Us”, or “Our”). Your privacy is important to us. In order to better protect your privacy, we provide this notice (the “Policy”) explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. By providing personal information to Dotloop through our website [dotloop.wpengine.com](http://dotloop.wpengine.com/), you consent to Dotloop collecting, using, and disclosing your personal information in accordance with this Policy. To make this Policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request).

### The Information We Collect

   
This Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on [dotloop.com](https://www.dotloop.com/). We consider “personal information” to mean information about an identifiable individual. The type of personal information collected on the website includes, but is not limited to: Name, Address, Email Address, Phone Number, and your involvement in a real estate transaction. We also collect billing information such as credit card numbers. Contact information of other people may also be collected from or submitted by you during the transaction process or for other communication purposes. When we need to collect credit card data from you in connection with a transaction, portions of pages on our website utilize framing technology that preserves the look and feel of our website but allows your credit card data to be sent securely and directly to our payment processor instead of to dotloop. 

### The Way We Use Information

   
We use the information you provide when processing or completing a transaction on dotloop to communicate to the other parties involved. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete a transaction, where required or permitted by law, or as set forth in this Policy (see Information Sharing section below). We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may share your personal information with third parties who may offer services that may be of interest (“Third Party Sharing”).

Similarly, we use the information you provide about someone else for communications required during the transaction process. If you provide personal information about your client(s) to us for the purpose of completing a transaction, you represent and warrant that you have obtained their consent to do so. Such information may be shared with outside parties to complete a transaction for Third Party Sharing.

If you wish to opt out of such Third Party Sharing, please email us with your request at [support@dotloop.com](mailto:support@dotloop.com). We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. dotloop may use the information collected from you to provide you with additional information about dotloop’s services, partners, promotions, and events. Every marketing email from dotloop contains instructions on how to opt out of receiving further marketing emails.

We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where [dotloop.com](https://www.dotloop.com/) is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our website to better suit our customers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as improving system performance or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

In the event that we enter into a business transaction, such as a merger with or an acquisition by another company, or a sale of some or all of our assets, your personal information may be among the assets that are transferred or disclosed in connection with such a transaction, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

Finally, we never use or share the personal information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described in this Policy without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

### Our Commitment to Data Security

   
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure the information we collect online. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). You should note, though, that the internet is not a 100% secure environment. There is no guarantee that information you provide or that we maintain may not be accessed, copied, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at [support@dotloop.com](mailto:support@dotloop.com).

### How You Can Access Your Information

Upon request, Dotloop will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You can retrieve, correct or update your personal information by accessing your account on [dotloop.com](https://www.dotloop.com/) or by contacting us at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, or as necessary to facilitate compliance with real estate transaction record retention requirements. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Opt out Preferences and Service Related Emails

   
We will also send you service related email announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. You do not have an option to opt out of these emails, which are not promotional in nature.

### Passive Collection

   
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate, and administer the site.

### Tracking Technologies

   
Dotloop and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.

### Behavioral Targeting

   
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our website or to manage advertising on other sites.

If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

### Information Sharing

   
Normally, we will not disclose personal information unless you have authorized the disclosure. There are some circumstances where we may disclose personal information without consent. Such circumstances include where we are required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of an identifiable person or group; or where the information is public. We will not disclose more information than required or permitted.

We endeavor to ensure that your personal information is as accurate as necessary and generally retain personal information as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.

We operate in the United States. Any information provided through [dotloop.com](https://www.dotloop.com/) will be processed and stored in the United States, where privacy laws may offer different levels of protection from those in Canada or other countries and personal information may be subject to access by and disclosure to law enforcement agencies in the United States. We may also share personal information with organizations that perform services on our behalf. We require those service providers to take the necessary precautions to protect the personal information.

In most cases and subject to legal or contractual restrictions, you are free to refuse or withdraw your consent at any time upon reasonable, advance notice.
