We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.

At times DotLoop.com may make certain non-identifying information available to strategic partners that work with DotLoop.com to provide products and services. Such information helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests and needs.

We may also share personal information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful.

In the event that we enter into a business transaction, such as a merger with or an acquisition by another company, or a sale of some or all of our assets, your personal information may be among the assets that are transferred or disclosed in connection with such a transaction.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described in this Policy without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
