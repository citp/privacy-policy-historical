We consider consent, data privacy, and transparency a top priority. Bringing the power to control personal information that we store into the hands of you, the user, is an important pillar in building a service and community like DOYOU. Here are a few of our privacy principles: 

  * Information you upload or post to DOYOU may be seen by others depending on your privacy settings.
  * We aggregate and de-identify certain information about our members to use for business purposes.
  * We give you ways to control the privacy of your personal information and are continuously working to enhance privacy options available to you.

This Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by DOYOU, the mobile or tablet versions thereof, any DOYOU software, and any applications created by Skyrocket whether available through a social networking site or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, the “Service”). Please note that the availability of any DOYOU applications on a social networking site, mobile or tablet device, internet television or other technology platform does not indicate any relationship or affiliation between DOYOU and such social networking site, mobile or tablet device, or internet television or other technology platform. 

If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to [contact us](https://help.doyouyoga.com/). 

By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Policy.

Through your continued use of the Website after changes are made to the Policy, you accept the Policy as modified. 

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**

Information you provide – When you sign up for a DOYOU account we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password and may require your date of birth, gender, mailing and billing address, and zip code). At the time you register as a member or during your free trial period, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.

We also use your name, email address and other information on our system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, events, and to solicit your feedback and input. We may also use your information, or a portion thereof, to send you marketing materials and/or DOYOU newsletters or other information Skyrocket thinks you may need, unless you notify us that you do not wish to receive such materials. Please [contact us](https://help.doyouyoga.com/) to request that you not be sent any or all of such information. 

**Cookies** – When you visit DOYOU, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

You can delete our cookie at any time by following the instructions contained in your browser’s help file, or by contacting that company providing your browser’s technical support. DOYOU does not use cookies to store information such as credit card numbers, telephone numbers, or any other sensitive information.

  * Providing our products and services to users, including the display of customized content and advertising; 
  * Sharing information to our business partners who perform core services (such as hosting, billing, data storage, security, and reporting services) related to the operation of the Website and Service; 
  * Collecting and processing information about your actual location to provide location aware products and services and other content; 
  * Verifying your identity;
  * Following up with transactions initiated on the Website;
  * Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;
  * Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and
  * Developing new services.



Skyrocket processes personal information on its servers around the world. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We provide personal and non-personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted third parties or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such personal information based on our instructions and in compliance with the appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 

We may also disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Skyrocket or its parent company, subsidiaries, or affiliates, (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Skyrocket or the users of the Website, or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or users of the Website. 

**Choices for personal information** – When you sign up for the Service, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. 

If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, and you decline, Skyrocket may not be able to provide its Service to you. 

**Maintenance of personal information** – You can access your information contained in the DOYOU database by following instructions on our [Data Protection & Security](https://web.archive.org/gdpr/) page. If you believe any of your information is incorrect or needs updating, please let us know at the email address help@doyouyoga.com. Skyrocket will use reasonable efforts to correct your information and our records upon verification of the requested change. If you no longer wish to receive email notifications from DOYOU, please let us know by [contacting us](https://help.doyouyoga.com/). In the text of your email or letter specify which notifications you no longer wish to receive and provide your exact name, email address and/or address so that we can do our best to ensure that you stop receiving the notifications that you no longer wish to receive. After such a request is received, Skyrocket will use reasonable efforts to refrain from including you when sending such notifications to DOYOU visitors/users/customers. 

We maintain procedures for you to review the information that we collect about you. Find out more on our [Data Protection & Security](https://web.archive.org/gdpr/) page. 

**Information Security** – We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. 

We restrict access to personal information to Skyrocket employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. 

However, please note that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so while Skyrocket strives to protect your information, Skyrocket cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you voluntarily give to the DOYOU platform. 

Accessing and updating personal information – When you use the Services, we provide you with access to your personal information and we allow you to either correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. You can do so via our [Data Protection & Security](https://web.archive.org/gdpr/) page. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. 

**Website Areas Beyond Skyrocket’s Control**

Third party links, co-brand relationships and public forums – In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, Skyrocket may choose various third party websites to link to, link from, and frame within, the Website. Skyrocket also may participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to its users. However, even if the third party is affiliated with Skyrocket, we have no control over these linked sites, each of who have separate privacy and data collection practices independent of Skyrocket. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such web sites. Please make sure you are comfortable with the privacy practices of every site you visit before providing the site with your personal information. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. 

We also may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to you on the Website. Please remember that we cannot control the information that is shared by members and that anything you voluntarily provide in any public area of the Internet will be publicly available to other visitors on that web site and potentially to other third parties. Thus, please note that you should always exercise caution when deciding to publicly disclose any of your personal information in these and similar areas. 

**Enforcement**

Skyrocket’s regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or Skyrocket’s treatment of personal information by contacting us. 

When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Skyrocket’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Skyrocket and an individual. 

**Users Under 18**

The DOYOU content is not directed at users under eighteen (18) years of age, and if you provide information about yourself as a user of DOYOU, you are representing that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under eighteen (18) years of age, but if we do become aware of having collected personally identifiable information from a user who is younger than eighteen (18) years of age, we will remove such information from our files. 

**EU Members’ Rights**

If you are habitually located in the European Union, you have the right to access, rectify, download or erase your information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited circumstances.
