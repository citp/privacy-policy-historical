**UNILEVER PRIVACY POLICY**

_Last Updated: December 2012_

Unilever is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is protected.  This Privacy Policy explains the types of personal information we collect and how we use, disclose and protect that information.

**What does this Privacy Policy apply to?**

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected by the Unilever Group of companies in connection with the services they offer. Find out more about the Unilever Group at <http://unilever.com/aboutus/>. This includes information collected offline through our Careline and consumer call centres, direct marketing campaigns, sweepstakes and competitions, and online through our websites, branded pages on third party platforms and applications accessed or used through such websites or third party platforms which are operated by or on behalf of the Unilever Group (“ **Unilever Sites** ”).    This Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into and forms part of the terms and conditions of use of the applicable Unilever Site.  For information about the Unilever Group company responsible for protecting your personal information, see [ **Your privacy rights and who to contact**](http://www.unileverprivacypolicy.com/en_gb/policy.aspx#rights) below.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to:    
•    information collected by third party websites, platforms and/or applications (“Third Party Sites”) which we do not control;    
•    information collected by Third Party Sites which you access via links on Unilever Sites; or    
•    banners, sweepstakes and other advertisements or promotions on Third Party Sites that we may sponsor or participate in.    
These Third Party Sites may have their own privacy policies and terms and conditions. We encourage you to read them before using those Third Party Sites. 

**Your consent**

Unilever will not collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent.    In most cases, we will ask for your consent explicitly but, in some cases, we may infer consent from your actions and behaviour.  By using a Unilever Site, you are consenting to the relevant Unilever Group company collecting, using and disclosing your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.    
We may ask you to provide additional consent if we need to use your personal information for purposes not covered by this Privacy Policy.  You are not obliged to provide such consent but if you decide not to then your participation in certain activities may be restricted.  If you provide additional consent, the terms of that consent shall prevail in the event of any conflict with the terms of this Privacy Policy.    
If you do not agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in this way, please do not use the Unilever Sites or otherwise provide Unilever with personal information.  

**Children**

The majority of Unilever Sites are designed and intended for use by adults.  Where a Unilever Site is intended for use by a younger audience, we will obtain consent from a parent or guardian before we collect personal information where we feel it is appropriate to do so or where it is required by applicable data protection laws and regulations (the age at which consent is necessary varies from country to country).  If you are a child over the age where parental consent is required in your country, you should review the terms of this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian to make sure you understand and accept them.     
If we discover that we have collected information without consent from a parent or guardian where such consent should have been obtained, we will delete that information as soon as possible.    
Access to certain parts of the Unilever Sites and/or eligibility to receive prizes, samples or other rewards may be limited to users over a certain age. We may use your personal information to carry out age verification checks and enforce any such age restrictions.

**What information do we collect?**

In this Privacy Policy, your "personal information" means information or pieces of information that could allow you to be identified. This typically includes information such as your name, address, screen name, profile picture, email address, and telephone number, but can also include other information such as IP address, shopping habits, preferences and information about your lifestyle or preferences such as your hobbies and interests.

We may make available a service through which you can receive text or other types of messages from Unilever (such as short message service, or SMS, enhanced message service, or EMS, and multimedia message service, or MMS) on your wireless or mobile device (“Mobile Message Service”). If you subscribe to one of our Mobile Message Services, you agree to receive such messages from Unilever at the address or mobile number you provide for that purpose (unless and until you have elected to opt out of receiving such messages by following the instructions in the [ **Your privacy rights and who to contact**](http://www.unileverprivacypolicy.com/en_gb/policy.aspx#rights) section below).    
You understand that your wireless carrier’s standard rates apply to these messages, and that you may change your mind at any time by following the instructions in the [ **Your privacy rights and who to contact**](http://www.unileverprivacypolicy.com/en_gb/policy.aspx#rights) section below. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, you agree that we may collect from you and provide your carrier with your applicable payment information in connection therewith. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device you use to sign up for the Mobile Message Service, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. In addition to meeting certain age restrictions and any other terms and conditions associated with each Mobile Message Service, you may be required to register personal information such as your name, text message, wireless address or mobile phone number. We may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your use of the Mobile Message Service. We will use the information we obtain in connection with our Mobile Message Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please note, however, that your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies.    
You acknowledge and agree that the Mobile Message Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We do not guarantee that your use of the Mobile Message Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience.

While your personal information is in another country, it may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in that country in accordance with its laws. Subject to such lawful access requests, we promise that anyone processing your personal information outside your country of origin is required to implement measures to protect it and is only entitled to process it in accordance with Unilever’s instructions.
