# Dovetail Games | Privacy

**Introduction**

Dovetail Games collect information as you use our products and services. This privacy policy tells you about the information we collect and how we use it. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

This privacy policy (along with our end-user licence agreement as set out at http://www.dovetailgames.com/terms/ (hereinafter, the “EULA”) and any additional terms of use incorporated by reference into the EULA, together “Our Terms of Use”) applies to your use of:

  * Any and all software we develop and publish (and any and all associated content including but not limited to add-on content, subsequent/future versions and updates) (individually, a “Product” or collectively the "Products"), once you have purchased or downloaded a copy of any of the Products onto your personal computer (“Device”); and
  *  Any of the services accessible through any of the Products or other services which we otherwise make available (the “ **Services** ”) on any of our websites including but not limited to Dovetailgames.com and railsimulator.com (our “Sites”), unless that Site (for example www.engine-driver.com) contains a separate privacy policy that applies to that particular Service, in which case that privacy policy only applies.



Our Sites and any of the Products may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates and services offered by third parties (including, but not limited to, websites on which any of the Products or the Services are advertised). If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites and any services that may be accessible through them have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or for any personal data that may be collected through these websites or services, such as contact and location data. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites or use these services. Some of these services are noted in section 2 below along with where you can find the related privacy policies for those websites and services.

For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, we are the data controller.

In this document:

            'you' refers to you, the user accessing a service owned or operated by us or playing any Product developed and published by us.

**1\. Information we collect and how we use it**

Depending on the type of Service or Product you use, we will collect different information. The information collected falls in to three broad categories:

  * Information collected while you play a Product;
  * Information collected when you contact us by email; and
  * Information collected when you access any of the Sites.



Each of these is considered separately.

**1.1 Information collected while you play a Product and how it is used**

Information we collect

We collect information about the features you use and how you use them. We do this to allow us to improve our Products and Services.

The information we may collect includes:

  * **Personal information** : We may collect personal information including but limited to name and contact details, although you are under no obligation to provide this. 


  * **Device information** : We may collect device-specific information about the Device you may use to access the Product (such as the hardware you are using, operating system version, browser type etc.). 


  * **Software configuration information** : We may collect information about your game configuration (including but not limited to choice of language and country of installation) and content you have installed to better understand how different users around the world access and engage with our Products. 


  * **Game playing information** : When you use our Products or Services, we may automatically collect and store certain information on our servers. This may include:
  *      details of how you used our Product or Services, such as your menu choices;
  *      details of how you have interacted with the Product, including but not limited to features you have engaged with, scenarios executed in the (and how they're completed) and progress you make within the Product; and
  *      event information including but not limited to crashes, system activity, hardware settings, operating systems and hardware configuration.


  * **Add-on content acquisitions** : To correctly display content that you have purchased, we keep a record of your acquisitions so that we can show the content you own in a different way from that which you have not yet purchased.
  *   **Web server statistics** : Images displayed while loading Product are held on a web server. This, like most web servers, will log the IP address of the machine running the Product along with other parameters describing the route and the language being used.



In gathering the information, we may store an encrypted version of your Steam_ID to allow us to uniquely identify your usage.

How we use the information we collect

We use the information we collect for system administration and Service updates and to provide, maintain, protect and improve our Products, including but not limited to the choice of add-on content. Furthermore, we may use such information we collect for the purposes of targeted marketing activity to notify you of new releases, special offers and provide you with retail discounts, as well as related news and promotions.

The web server statistics allow us to monitor traffic patterns to ensure appropriate servers are in place and also to prevent inappropriate use of these servers. This information is strictly for our own use. If, in the future, this is ever made public (for example to potential advertisers, publishers, distributors or licensing partners) it will only be made public in a summary or report form showing aggregated and anonymised information and it will not be possible to identify an individual to whom it may relate.

**1.2 Information collected when you contact us by email (such as for support questions)**

Information we collect

Submitted Information: We may ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by us and when you report a problem with any of our Sites.

**Additional information** :

  * If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence; 


  * We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them; 


  * If you subscribe to our newsletter, we will keep a record of your email address; and 


  * We may keep details of transactions you carry out through any of the Sites.



How we use the information we collect

We use this information to identify problems or potential problems with and opportunities for improving our Products. We may share the contents of your communication with selected third parties where these are relevant to the email that you have sent us (such as referring technical questions to partners such as Valve), but will not do this if the email clearly states NOT FOR PUBLICATION in the title or first line.

We may use your email address to:

  * Inform you about our Services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes, improvements, promotions or new products; and 


  * Carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.



If you do wish to stop receiving any marketing communications, please follow the 'unsubscribe' link which can be found at the bottom of each message.

**1.3 Information collected when you use web-based services we provide (including www.railsimulator.com and www.dovetailgames.com) Note that this section does NOT apply to Sites with their own privacy policy (such as www.engine-driver.com)**

Because we use commercially available web hosting services, they will collect certain information about your usage of the Sites.

These web-hosting services may:

a) log requests made to the server, this includes the kind of browser that you use to access the system; and

b) track your access any of the Sites in order to understand usage patterns and optimise the Sites so that they provide a better experience.

How we use the information collected

We use this information to:

  * Ensure that content displayed on our Sites is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer; and 


  * Gather information about topics that are of interest so that we can better plan future developments and optimise user features and experiences. 



This information is strictly for our own use but if this is ever made public (for example to potential advertisers, publishers, distributors or licensing partners) it will only be made public in a summary or report form showing aggregated and anonymised information and there will not be any possible way that it can be tracked back to an individual. For example, such a report might show how many hits our Sites have received each month.

**2\. Companies may collect data when using Products and Services provided by us**
