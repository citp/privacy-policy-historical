   </a><h1><a></a><a name="1a">Your California Privacy Rights</a></h1><a name="1a">
   <p> If you are a California resident and have shared Personal Information  with us, a California law gives you the right to request and obtain from us, once per calendar year, information about how we have shared your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  You may send such requests to us via postal mail at: Unilever Consumer Services, 920 Sylvan Avenue, 2nd Floor, Englewood Cliffs, NJ 07632, or call us at 1-866-204-9750.  If applicable, such information would include a list of the names and addresses of all third parties with whom Personal Information was shared during the prior calendar year for such third parties’ marketing purposes, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information shared during such prior calendar year.  For additional information, see the Sharing Personal Information with Third Parties for Marketing Purposes  section below.</p>
   </a><h1><a name="1a"></a><a name="1b">Your Consent to This Privacy Policy</a></h1>
   <p>By providing Unilever with <a href="#1d">Personal Information</a>, by visiting Unilever’s websites or by using various services and features offered by Unilever (whether online or offline), you agree with the terms of our current Privacy Policy as posted here, as such terms may be amended from time to time.</p>
   <h1><a name="1c">Collection of Personal Information</a></h1>
   <p>As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means personally identifiable information such as your name, street address, telephone number, credit card and other payment information, screen name, e-mail address, wireless e-mail address, short message service or text message address, demographic information and other information that may identify you or allow online or offline contact with you.  We may collect your Personal Information from you directly, or from third parties, and we may combine it with other information we collect about you from you or from third parties.</p>
   <p>We may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party. For example, you may be able to send an electronic "post card" to a friend, in which case we will need that person's name and e-mail address. Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose (e.g., to mail the post card) and we will not contact such third party again unless the third party contacts us.</p>
   <h1><a name="1d">How We Use Your Information</a></h1>
   <p><strong>Our Use of Your Personal Information</strong>.  When you provide your Personal Information to us, we will use it for the express purpose for which it was collected (e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes or to send you a sample). It may also be used by the brand responsible for the website or promotion, as well as by our other brands, to contact you regarding other products and services which may be of interest to you (including those we may offer jointly with other companies).  At any time, however, you may opt out of such contact (see <a href="#1l">Whom to Contact</a>).</p>
   <p><strong>Sharing Personal Information with Third Parties for Marketing Purposes</strong>.  We will not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes without obtaining your prior consent.  If you have granted us permission to share your Personal Information with such third party entities, such third parties’ use of your Personal Information will be subject to their privacy policies.  You should contact those entities directly regarding any communications you may receive from them, including if you later decide that you no longer want that third party to use your Personal Information.</p>
   <p><strong>Our Service Providers</strong>.  At times we may retain third parties to help us operate our business. (e.g., to notify potential winners of a sweepstakes or to analyze data to help us better tailor our sites to your needs). These Service Providers may have access to your Personal Information for the purpose of performing these services for Unilever but they are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any other way or for any other purpose.</p>
   <p><strong>Business Transfers.</strong>  Unilever does not sell Personal Information, except to an entity to which we divest all or a portion of our business (for example, in connection with our sale of a brand), or otherwise in connection with a merger, consolidation, change in control, reorganization or liquidation of all or a portion of our business.</p>
   <p><strong>Public Forums.</strong>  When you contribute to a public area or feature of our website, such as a chat room, blog, message board or other open forum, the information that you submit to these areas or features may be made available to the general public.  For this reason, we recommend that you do not use or submit any Personal Information, about yourself or others, on these areas of our website.</p>
   <p><strong>Legally Required Disclosures.</strong>  We will release your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or court order, and if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Unilever, its customers or the public.</p>
   <h1><a name="1e">Non-Personally-Identifiable Information We May Collect Online</a></h1>
   <p>We may use various technologies to collect non-personal information about your visits online so that we can tailor our sites and products to best suit your interests and needs.</p>
   <p><strong>Cookies.</strong>  You may have heard of "cookies," which are small data files or pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Unilever may use cookies to collect information during and about your visits to our websites, such as the particular site areas you visit and the products or services you buy through our websites. Cookies may also be used to recognize that you have provided Personal Information to us and refrain from requesting the same information a second time (e.g., a username and/or password, or an e-mail address or other contact information). </p>
   <p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but can easily be set to refuse cookies. Note, however, that refusal of cookies may limit your ability to take full advantage of all the site features.</p>
   <p><strong>IP Address and Clickstream Data</strong>.  Our servers collect information about your computer, such as your IP address, the type of Internet browser you are using and the type of computer operating system you are using. Such information may be used to personalize your web site experience, and to evaluate statistics about usage of our websites. Such information may be used anonymously and in the aggregate or may be linked to your Personal Information. Also, our server may record your activities as you navigate to, on and from our websites. </p>
   <p><strong>Clear GIFs</strong>. We may use pixel tags (also called clear gifs) or other similar tracking technologies in our websites and/or in our communications to collect information about your navigation on our websites, and to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message.  This information enables us to serve you and your interests better. </p>
   <p>Any or all of these activities with respect to website usage information (as described above in this section) may be performed on our behalf by our Service Providers. </p>
   <h1><a name="1f">Third Party Ad Servers</a></h1>
   <p>Advertisements on our site may be provided by third parties who manage them for us.  Those third parties may employ cookies and clear gifs to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement, and to measure advertising effectiveness.  We do not control these companies’ use of cookies and clear gifs.  Some of these companies (like the ad networks) are members of the industry group, the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of their cookies.  For more information, we encourage you to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer web site at http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/.</p>
   <h1><a name="1g">Third Party Linked To Sites</a></h1>
   <p>When you are on our websites you may be able to visit, or link to, other sites which may be operated by unaffiliated third parties or by Unilever, but which are not covered by this Privacy Policy. These sites may collect Personal Information about you, and you should check the privacy policies of the specific site you are visiting to understand your rights.</p>
   <h1><a name="1h">Mobile Message Services</a></h1>
   <p>We may make available a service through which you can receive text or other types of messages from Unilever (such as short message service, or SMS, enhanced message service, or EMS, and multimedia message service, or MMS) on your wireless or mobile device (“Mobile Message Service”).  If you subscribe to one of our Mobile Message Services, you agree to receive such messages from Unilever at the address you provide for that purpose  (unless and until you have elected to opt out of receiving such messages by following the instructions in the <a href="#1l">Whom to Contact section below</a>).</p>
   <p>You understand that your wireless carrier’s standard rates apply to these messages, and that you may change your mind at any time by following the instructions in the <a href="#1l">Whom to Contact</a> section below.  If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, you agree that we may collect from you and provide your carrier with your applicable payment information in connection therewith. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device you use to sign up for the Mobile Message Service, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.  In general, to use the Mobile Message Service, you must be 18 years of age or older and reside in the United States.  In addition to any other terms and conditions that may be presented in connection with each Mobile Message Service, you must first register and provide all required Personal Information, which may include, for example, your name, text message or other wireless address.  We may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your use of the Mobile Message Service.  We will use the information we obtain in connection with our Mobile Message Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Please note, however, that your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies. </p>
   <p>You acknowledge and agree that the Mobile Message Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks.  We do not guarantee that your use of the Mobile Message Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience.  You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the Mobile Message Service.  We may also access the content of your account and/or wireless account with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and resolving technical problems and/or service-related complaints.</p>
   <h1><a name="1i">Privacy of Children Online</a></h1>
   <p>Unilever is committed to protecting the online privacy of children and making the Internet safe for our users.  Some portions of our websites may be directed to kids under 13.  In these areas of our websites, our conduct is governed by the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (“CARU”).  The statements in this Policy generally about our collection and use of Personal Information also apply to our treatment of Personal Information collected from children under the age of 13, with the added protection of the special provisions that follow. For certain online activities on such child-directed sites, before collecting or using any Personal Information from children under the age of 13, we may require verifiable parental consent.  However, we may also collect Personal Information from children without first obtaining parental consent in some situations, such as:</p>
   <p> * We may collect the name or online contact information (e.g., an e-mail address) of a child or parent to use to send a notice to the parent or to ask for the parent’s consent for the child’s participation on our website.<br>
     * We may collect online contact information from a child to respond to the child’s request (e.g., to answer a question about one of our products or to send the child a periodic newsletter). <br>
     * We may collect the name and online contact information from a child to protect the safety of the child on our websites or to protect the security and integrity of the websites and to comply with other legal and investigatory requirements. </p>
   <p>Unilever will not require a child to provide unnecessary Personal Information to us in order to participate in an activity on our sites.</p>
   <h1><a name="1j">Security of Information</a></h1>
   <p>We endeavor to keep your sensitive Personal Information secure from unauthorized access, modification and misuse. For example, we have a policy to restrict access to all Personal Information provided to the websites.  Nevertheless, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.</p>
   <p>You may be able to create an account on our website with a username and password. In some cases, your username may be your e-mail address.  If so, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password. We recommend that you choose a unique password for your website account and that you do not use any password that you also use for any other accounts which may contain your sensitive information, such as financial accounts or e-mail accounts.  You agree to immediately notify Unilever of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.</p>
   <p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you.  If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.<strong>  You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.  If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at privacy.policy@unilever.com with the alternative contact information you wish to be used</strong>.</p>
