We respect your privacy. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

Therefore, the domain name registration information you provide us is, and must be, made available to the public. At times our customers may be included within searches of the Whois… database; however, any "spam" received through the use of Whois… does not originate from Domainsite.com.
