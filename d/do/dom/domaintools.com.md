# Privacy Policy | Company | DomainTools

_Last updated December 13, 2013_

Your privacy is important to DomainTools. This privacy policy is designed to tell you how we collect and use personal information so you can make an informed decision about using our websites, including domaintools.com, screenshots.com, and other sites on which this policy is posted. 

DomainTools may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, the changes will be posted on this page and the date indicated above will be updated. So please check this page periodically. In the case of material changes, we may also contact you using the email address you provided, if any, or post a notice on our website that the privacy policy has been modified. 

Please read this statement before using our websites or submitting any personal information to us and let us know if you have any questions. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not submit personal information or use our website or online services. 

### Collection and use of personal information

Personal information is information that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person. DomainTools collects personal information in several ways. 

When you register for a DomainTools account, we may ask you to provide certain personal information, including your name and email address. If you register for a paid account or make a purchase, we may ask you to provide your address, phone number, and credit-card or PayPal billing information. 

We also request information from you when you log in to your DomainTools account, where you will be required to provide your account name and password as a condition to accessing certain information, materials, or services. 

DomainTools may use personal information, either alone or in combination with other information, to provide and improve our services in several ways. For example, we use your email address to send registration reminders, to notify you of updates, and to send news and special offers. We use your credit card or other billing information to obtain payment for certain kinds of accounts or for other purchases you make. 

We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you register for an account but do not wish to receive additional marketing material from us, you can generally indicate your preference on the registration form. If you no longer wish to receive news or promotional materials, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each news release or communication. 

DomainTools may retain collected personal information indefinitely. 

### Collection and use of other information

DomainTools may also collect other, non-personal information, which does not permit identification or association with a particular individual. 

We may collect information about user activity on our websites. This includes the time, the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the referral source (if any), and the browser user agent. This information is not shared with third parties. It may be used by DomainTools to detect and monitor potential misuse of our services, to improve our services, and to provide customer support. DomainTools may retain this information indefinitely. 

If we do combine non-personal information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information for as long as it remains combined. 

### Cookies and other technologies

Cookies are small files that a website or its service provider transfers to your computer through your web browser that enables the website or service provider system to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. DomainTools uses cookies to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business. 

DomainTools may also collect information about your use of our website and services. For example, we may record your searches and uses of various services we provide. This is done in order to provide you with the results of those searches or services when you next visit our website. DomainTools may retain this information indefinitely. 

### Disclosure to third parties

DomainTools does not sell personal information to third parties. 

DomainTools may provide information, including personal information, to certain third-party service providers. For example, we may provide user email addresses to our third-party email service provider in order to contact our users by email. Also, we provide necessary billing information to our third-party credit-card processor for the purpose of completing user transactions. These companies are obligated to protect your information and are not permitted to use it for other purposes. 

We may also release your information when we believe release is reasonably necessary in order to comply with the law, enforce our terms of service, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party. 

### Security

DomainTools follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. But no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

Your information is stored on DomainTools' servers. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit-card billing information) on our registration or order forms, we undertake to encrypt that information using secure socket layer (SSL) or other similar technology. In order to benefit from those protections, you must use an SSL-enabled web browser. 

DomainTools personnel are trained appropriately regarding the application of privacy practices and the importance of protecting your information. 

### Children

DomainTools does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. Our website, products, and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. 

### Links to other sites

Our websites may contain links to third-party websites at which personal information may be collected. DomainTools has no control over the information you provide to third-party websites and the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy applicable to that site. 

### How you can access or correct your information

You can help ensure that your contact and billing information and other preferences are accurate, complete, and up-to-date by logging in to your DomainTools account.
