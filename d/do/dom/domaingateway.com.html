We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to enable us to personalize your experience with our Web Site. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze our Web Site usage and/or provide this information to third parties for the same purpose, as well as to offer you products or services. 
</p>
<p>
On occasion we may share your non-personally identifiable information that we collect and personal information that you provide to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Company's Terms and Conditions, in order to diagnose a problem with our server, to administer our Web Site or as we otherwise deem necessary in our sole and absolute discretion.

</p>
<h3>Security Measures </h3>

<h3>Special Notification for California Residents </h3>
<p>
Users of the Web Site that reside in California and have provided their personal information to the Web Site may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information (if any) to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

<h3>Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
<p>
We make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We will ask that you identify yourself and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. The initial procedure to access, correct or delete your personal information is to <a href="/contactus.php" title="Contact Domain Gateway" target="_blank">contact us</a>.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy without any notice whatsoever to you and for whatever reason we deem appropriate under the circumstances. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this Privacy Policy so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it.
