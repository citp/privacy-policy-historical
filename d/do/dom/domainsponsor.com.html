                    <p><strong>Information Retention &amp; Security</strong><br>
                      Rook stores your information for no less than one year from the time of initial submission, as well as automated personal information we collect about you and shall retain the information for as long as appropriate to carry out the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with applicable laws, contracts, rules and regulations.<br>
                      Rook takes appropriate security measures to protect our users' information against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or destruction. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as digital encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal information. We want you to feel confident using our Sites to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.  You transmit data, including personal information to us at your own risk.</p>
                    <p><strong>Control of Your Access Credentials</strong><br>

                      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We reserve the right to modify it at any time, so please check it frequently. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, all amended terms will automatically be effective 30 days after the initial changes have been posted to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Sites after we have posted any Privacy Policy changes indicates your agreement to the changes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights<br>
                      </strong>Under California's "Shine the Light" law SB-27, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2014 will receive information regarding 2013 sharing activities).</p>
                    <p>To obtain this information from Rook, please send an email message to privacy@domainsponsor.com with "Request for California Privacy Information" on the subject line and in the body of your message. We will provide the required information within thirty (30) days to you at your e-mail address in response. Not all information sharing is covered by the "Shine the Light" requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.</p>
