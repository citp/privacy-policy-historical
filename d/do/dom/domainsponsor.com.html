<p>
<em><u>Third Party List Information</u></em>.  We may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from third party data gathering sources.

</p>

<p>
<em><u>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection Technology</u></em>.  We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our Sites.  For example, we collect and store non-personally identifying information through log files, cookies, clear gifs ("web beacons"), and third parties to create a profile of our users that details the users' viewing preferences.
