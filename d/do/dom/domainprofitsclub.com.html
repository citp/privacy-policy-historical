  <strong>4. THE TYPE  OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU.</strong><br>
  Like most places on the  Internet, simply by visiting our website you automatically tell us certain  information. This includes basic information such as your IP address, when you  visited, the website from where you came prior to visiting us, the website  where you go when you leave our website, your computer's operating system, and  the type of web browser that you are using. Our website automatically records  this basic information about you.<br>
  And like many other  websites, we may use cookies. In plain English, this means information that our  website's server transfers to your computer.
