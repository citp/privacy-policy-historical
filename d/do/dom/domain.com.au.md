In this Privacy Policy, **Domain Group** , **us** , **we** or **our** means Domain and its related bodies corporate, partnerships and joint venture entities. Domain Group is the operator of the network (which includes our websites and apps) and the data controller for the personal information collected and processed via the network. 

This Privacy Policy sets out:

  * what is considered personal information;
  * what personal information we collect and hold;

  * what happens if we are not able to collect personal information;

We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth) ( **Privacy Act** ) (subject to exemptions that apply to us under that Act) and any other applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation ( **GDPR** ). However, due to the nature of some of our business activities, from time to time, we will handle personal information relying on the media exemption in the Privacy Act where appropriate. Where we do so, we will ensure that we comply with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards. We may also rely on related bodies corporate, employee records and other exemptions in the Privacy Act. If you require more information on the collection and use of personal information in the course of journalism, please visit the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards at [www.presscouncil.org.au/privacy-principles](http://www.presscouncil.org.au/privacy-principles?Embed=Y).

Your privacy matters to us, so whether you are new to Domain Group or are a long time user, please take the time to get to know our practices.

This may include (but is not limited to) your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card, direct debit or PayPal account information. If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.

**What personal information do we collect and hold**

We may collect the following types of personal information;

  * name;
  * business or residential address;

**Cookies**

When you visit our websites or use our mobile apps, we or our business partners may also collect information about your use of those websites or apps ( **usage data** ) through the use of cookies and other tracking software. This usage data enables us to provide you with an improved and more effective and personalised service, keep track of the products and services you use, analyse trends, measure transaction and search patterns, administer our website, diagnose problems, test and improve the quality of our products and services, gather broad demographic information and enable us to conduct targeted online advertising.  

You can manage the use of cookies on your computer or mobile device. If you do not wish to receive cookies you can set your browser so that your computer or device does not accept them.  You can also clear stored cookies from that browser or device at any time. Please note however that blocking cookies may affect your browsing experience and result in our services not operating as efficiently or effectively as they could.

The usage data we collect and use in cookies is not of itself personally identifiable information but if it is linked to personal information about an individual, it may become personally identifiable usage data.  In those circumstances we will treat that usage data as personal information and only use it in accordance with our Privacy Policy, the Privacy Act and any other applicable data protection legislation.

Your personal information will not be shared or disclosed other than as described in this Privacy Policy.

**What happens if we can’t collect your personal information**

The provision of your personal information is voluntary and is neither required by a statutory nor a contractual obligation. The provision of your personal information may, however, be necessary to receive our services/products as requested by you. If you do not provide us with the personal information described in this Privacy Policy, some or all of the following may happen:

  * as otherwise required or permitted by law (including the Privacy Act).



**Accessing and correcting your personal information**

You may request access to any personal information we hold about you by contacting us using the contact information provided below. We will not charge for simply making a request and will not charge for making any corrections to your personal information.  However, depending on the nature and scope of the personal information you have requested, we may charge you a reasonable fee to provide access to this information. 

If you make an access request, we will ask you to verify your identity. There may be instances where, for legal reasons, we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others, or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.

If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it. We will consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment, then we will add a note to the personal information stating that you disagree with it.

Members of our websites will generally be able to access and update their membership details online. We request that you keep your information as current as possible so that we may continue to improve our service to you.

**How you can complain about a breach of privacy**

If you believe your privacy has been breached by us or have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy or privacy practices, please contact us using the contact information below and provide details of the incident so that we can investigate it.

We have a process for investigating and dealing with privacy breaches. Once the Privacy Officer receives a complaint, the Privacy Officer will commence an investigation with the relevant business unit from which the alleged breach stemmed. The investigator will endeavour to determine the nature of the breach and how it occurred. We may contact you during the process to seek further clarification if necessary. If a breach is found, the Privacy Officer will work with senior management so that the process can be rectified to prevent any further breaches from taking place. We will also contact you to inform you of the outcome of the investigation. We will endeavour to resolve all investigations within a reasonable time.

We will treat your requests or complaints confidentially. Our representatives may contact you after receipt of your complaint to discuss your concerns and outline options regarding how they may be resolved. We will aim to ensure that your complaint is resolved in a timely and appropriate manner.

**Disclosure of personal information outside Australia**

We may disclose your personal information to entities located overseas for some or all of the purposes listed above.  This may include disclosure to the following entities:

  * our related bodies corporate, partnerships and joint venture entities; 
  * our data hosting and Cloud-based IT service providers; and
  * **other external service providers including those located in the U.K, U.S, Philippines and India.    **



We take reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipients of your personal information do not breach the privacy obligations relating to your personal information.

**GDPR**

If the European General Data Protection Regulation ( **GDPR** ) applies in respect of any of the personal information we collect, then the following sections apply to that personal information.  For the purposes of GDPR (as applicable), we are the ‘controller’.

In respect of residents of the European Economic Area ( **EEA** ), references to personal information in this Privacy Policy means any information that (either in isolation or in combination with other information) enables you to be identified directly or indirectly. 

In some instances, we may combine other information with personal information. If other information is combined with personal information or is used to build a profile of an individual (in a way which could be reasonably used to identify that individual), the combined information will be treated by us as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

If you are a resident in the EEA, you have the following rights in relation to your personal information (where applicable):

  1. **Access**. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not personal information concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, to request access to the personal information. This access information includes – inter alia – the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal information concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal information have been or will be disclosed. However, this is not an absolute right and the interests of other individuals may restrict your right of access. You may have the right to obtain a copy of the personal information undergoing processing free of charge. For further copies requested by you, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.
  2. **Rectification**. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to have incomplete or inaccurate personal information that we process about you rectified. 
  3. **Deletion**. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to request that we delete personal information that we process about you, except we are not obliged to do so if we need to retain such data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims or if other statutory restrictions apply. 
  4. **Restriction**. Depending on the circumstances and as provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information where you believe such data to be inaccurate; our processing is unlawful; or that we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose or where other legal grounds to request restriction apply unless we are not able to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not wish for us to delete it or because other statutory restrictions apply. 
  5. **Portability**. Depending on the circumstances and as provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to obtain personal information we hold about you, in a structured, electronic format, and to transmit such data to you or another data controller, where this is (i) personal information which you have provided to us, and (ii) if we are processing that data on the basis of your consent or to perform a contract with you. 
  6. **Objection**. Under certain circumstances, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal information by us and we are required to no longer process your personal information. Such right to object especially applies if we collect and process your personal information for profiling purposes in order to better understand your interests in our products and services or for certain types of direct marketing. If you have a right to object and if you exercise this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes by us. You may exercise this right by contacting the Privacy Officer. Such a right to object may, in particular, not exist if the processing of your personal information is necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already concluded.
  7. **Withdrawing Consent**. If you have consented to our processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, free of charge. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to your withdrawal of consent. You should note that the withdrawal of consent may not affect our right to use some or all of your personal information in circumstances where your consent was not required to use such data.  For example, if we need your personal information to manage a contractual relationship with you or we have legitimate interest in using your data to run our website or operate our business. 



You can make a request to exercise any of these rights in relation to your personal information by sending the request to the Privacy Officer at the contact details provided above. 

**Metadata**

You may use our website without providing any personal information about you. In this case, we will collect metadata that results from your usage of our website including: browser type and version, operating system and interface, website from which you are visiting us (referrer URL), webpage(s) you are visiting on our website, date and time of accessing our website, and internet protocol address. The metadata will be primarily used to improve the quality and services of our website and services by analysing the usage behaviour of our users in anonymised form and to prevent fraud, misuse of our IT systems, as well as to ensure physical, IT and network security. We may also use metadata for other purposes, including online advertising.  See our [Tracking and Targeting Policy](https://www.domain.com.au/group/tracking-and-targeting/) for further details.

**Retention**

Your personal information will only be retained for as long as it is reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected or as required for a legal, accounting or reporting purpose.  

**Security**

We will take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss or unauthorised access, including by means of firewalls, password access, secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.

If you suspect any misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal information, please let us know immediately.

Our website may contain links to other websites operated by third parties. We make no representations or warranties in relation to the privacy practices of any third party website and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of any third party website.
