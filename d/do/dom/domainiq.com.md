# Privacy Notice - moniker.com

Moniker.com and Moniker Marketplace are owned and operated by Moniker Online Services, LLC (“Moniker”).  At Moniker, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information about you as you utilize any Moniker services. Our Privacy Policy is subject to change, so we encourage you to visit this page frequently to review our practices. By using services provided by Moniker, you indicate that you agree to the collection and use of your information by Moniker as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

**Why We Collect Information**  
First and foremost, Moniker collects information to allow us to provide and improve our services and to present you with information and features that we believe will interest you. We also use your information to measure our success and performance. For example, aggregate information gives us an idea of the number of visitors we attract and how they navigate our site.

**Personal Information We Collect**  
Any personal information that is collected by us is provided by you strictly on a voluntary basis. We may receive personal information from you in a number of ways, depending on the Moniker service you are using and your choices while using our services. Depending upon the nature of the service being provided, we may ask you for, and you may choose to send to us, your name, e-mail address, physical address or other personal information necessary to complete a transaction, provide services to you, enter a contest or take a survey.  For example, personal information is requested when you register to be a user of our services. During registration, you are asked to provide your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal or zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests, etc. The more information you submit and the more accurate it is, the better we are able to tailor our services to your needs.  
Please note that when you purchase or use our services, you also represent to us that you have provided notice to, and obtained consent from, any third party individuals whose personal data you supply to us with regard to: (i) the purposes for which such third party's personal data have been collected, (ii) the intended recipients or categories of recipients of the third party's personal data, (iii) which of the third party's data are required to be provided to use our services and which data, if any, are voluntary, and (iv) how the third party can access and, if necessary, change the data held about them

**Use of Personal Information**  
As noted above, unless you voluntarily provide personal information for a specific purpose, we do not collect personal information from you. If you choose to provide personal information, we use your personal information to provide you with particular services that you request. For instance, we may use your personal information to contact you about services that you have requested and to provide you with data about the services.  More specifically, when you provide us with your email address, we will use your e-mail information to send you outbid offer notices and notices regarding the closing of transactions. In addition, we may use your e-mail for other features requiring e-mail notifications.   
We may also share your personal information with business partners who provide services you have requested. In these cases, we will provide only the information that is needed to perform the service. If you do not want Moniker to share your information in this way, you can simply choose not to sign up for the service in question. By providing your email address to Moniker, you expressly consent to receive emails from us.

In addition to the examples above, we may also use your personal information as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy or in any other manner in which you may consent, including any such consent granted by you under any Terms and Conditions that govern the services you use.  When your consent is required for use of personal information that is not otherwise authorized by this Privacy Policy or the applicable Terms and Conditions for a service, we will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending you an e-mail).

Moniker does not sell personal information to other companies. However, we will transfer personal information in connection with a sale or merger of Moniker or the division responsible for the services provided to you and we may share personal information with our corporate affiliates. We may also share your personal information with our technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who make our site available, enhance its functionality or provide associated services and/or who deal with you in processing your orders and/or delivering content, products, services and gifts and prizes.

In addition, you acknowledge and agree that, Moniker may make available and use personal information or other information you provide or that we otherwise maintain, to public or private third parties: (i) for inspection by law enforcement officials (including in the case of potential criminal activity); (ii) to respond to criminal and civil subpoenas and court orders that reasonably appear to be valid; (iii) to enforce or apply the terms of this Privacy Policy or any other agreement between us; and (iv) to protect the rights, property, or safety of Moniker, our users, or others, whether during or after the term of your use of our service.
