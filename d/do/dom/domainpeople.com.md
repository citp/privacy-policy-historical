DomainPeople, Inc. (“DomainPeople”) respects the privacy of its customers and visitors and is committed to protecting the personal information of its customers and visitors.

We want to ensure that you understand how we will and will not use the information you entrust to us. In order to fully understand your rights we encourage you to read this Policy.

For visitors, we've structured our websites so that, in general, you can visit us on Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.

While you are a DomainPeople customer, we manage information with regard to your account status, choice of services, and customer logs. In addition, we may store customers' electronic mail and other communications as a necessary incident to the transmission and delivery of those communications.

##  Surveys or Contests

From time-to-time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), to send participants an email newsletter.

While we may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests, DomainPeople will contractually ensure that said service provider will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

##  How do we use this information?

Our trusted affiliates are responsible for processing or handling some of the information we receive, such as order fulfillment for phone services. Those affiliates are not authorized to use such information for purposes beyond those specified by us including marketing and are required to preserve the confidentiality with which we treat such information.

We may disclose contact information with your permission when gathering and posting testimonials.

We will not otherwise disclose customer personal and account information unless we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of DomainPeople, our customers, or others.

##  Third Party Advertising and Cookies

The basic user information collected is used to help us analyze Web traffic, improve the content of our website and improve your experience on our website.

We do not trade, rent or sell your personal information to others, except as detailed in this Policy. We currently contract with several online partners who use the data only on our behalf to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Action Tags and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The information collected by the marketing company through the use of Action Tags and cookies is not personally identifiable. We have no access or control over these third party cookies or action tags. The information they collect and share with us helps us learn things like what kinds of customers our site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.

We use other third parties to provide credit card processing services on our site. When you purchase a service or product from us we will share contact and credit card information as necessary for the third party to provide that service.

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing services.

We may at times also use cookies, which are small pieces of information that a website can store in a designated file on your computer. Cookies allow a Web application to respond to you as an individual. Our cookies are tied to your personally identifiable informant for this purpose. By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the Web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes, and dislikes. Most Web browsers allow you to control this use of cookies. Please take a look at your particular browser for instructions on this function. If you elect to disable cookies, please keep in mind that you will not be able to take full advantage of a personalized experience on our website. It is possible that some portions of the site will not function properly or may perform more slowly if you choose to reject cookies.

Our website may allow for a chat function. Chat functions allow you to participate in “live” online conversations with us on our website. Although the transcripts from the chats may be stored internally on in-house servers for our records only, we collect no personally identifiable information about you when you participate unless you choose to provide that information to us.

##  How Can I access my personal information?

You can access your personal information, such as your address and contact information, at anytime to correct, change or delete any of the data shared with us when you became a customer of DomainPeople. As a customer of DomainPeople you can access your personal information by clicking on the “Customer Login” link at the top of any Web page. Your account information is secure and is accessible by using a password that you select. If you need assistance or have questions about correcting information you can contact us via email at [support@domainpeople.com](mailto:support@domainpeople.com). DomainPeople will respond to access requests within 30 days.

##  Security

DomainPeople has security measures in place to help prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. When you place an order online, your information, including your credit card number, is protected using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology. This encrypts order data and is designed to aid in ensuring the accuracy and security of that customer information.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our website, you can send email us at [support@domainpeople.com](mailto:support@domainpeople.com)

##  Links

Our website provides links to other websites, sites that may be maintained by companies that are not affiliates of ours. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites and we encourage you to use caution. In particular, we recommend that you view the privacy policy posted on each site to confirm the sites policies are acceptable to you. This Policy applies solely to information collected by this website.
