# Privacy Policy | Domestika

## General

Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.

Domestika LLC. (“Domestika”) is an online platform where creative professionals can showcase their work and discover the creative work of others and where creative professionals can learn from each other through online classes. **Domestika is hosted exclusively in the United States** and is operated from the Domestika offices in San Francisco, California. Domestika may be accessed directly on the web at [www.domestika.org](http://www.domestika.org/) (together with all linked pages, the “Site”).

By accessing any part of the Site, **you are agreeing to the terms** and conditions described below (this “Privacy Policy”) and to the Terms of Use (the “Terms of Use”). If you do not agree to any of these terms, you should not use the Site. This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both users who are simply viewing content available via the Service and users who have registered as members of Domestika.

The **text in the boxes** provides a brief explanation of the Privacy Policy and is not legally binding.

The **English version** of this agreement will be the version used when interpreting or construing this agreement.

You cannot use our Services unless you agree to our Terms and to our Privacy Policy, so please read both carefully.

## A Note to Users Outside of the United States

The **Service is hosted in the United States** and is intended for and directed to users in the United States. If you are accessing the Service from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Service, which is governed by United States law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Use, you are **transferring** your personal information to the United States and you expressly consent to that transfer.

If you do not want your personal data to be processed in the USA, please, do not use the Site.

## Information collected by Domestika

**We only collect personal information that is relevant** to the purpose of our Site. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We collect the following types of information from our users:

  1. ### Personal Information

**We receive and store any information you enter** on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.

In order for you to use Domestika Services **you must complete a registration form**. As part of this registration form, we will ask you for **personally identifiable information**. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you. This includes, but is not limited to, your email address, your name, and your birthday, but does not include your credit card number of billing information. Braintree processes all of the transactions on Domestika, and the information you provide to Braintree is subject to its privacy policy1. We do not receive any of the credit card information you provide to PayPal.

To allow you to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration, **we enable you to provide additional information in the user profile section** , such as a **bio** , your website address, your areas of interest, and your career preferences (location, type of job, etc.). In addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself in your profile.

Except for your birthday, e-mail address and phone, **all the information you decide to share with us will be published** under your profile. If you do not want that information to be published, do not fill in the relevant spaces of your profile or delete de information you have already submitted1.

We recommend that you **guard your sensitive information** and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.

In order to send you e-mail from Domestika, **we need your e-mail address**. To provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, geographical coordinates, and telephone number. We may give some or all of this information to the teachers for classes that you sign up for so that they can coordinate their classes. We will not give your name, email, or other personal information to unaffiliated third parties except with your consent or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.

  2. ### Other Information

We use your **IP address** to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Site, and to analyze traffic patterns on the Site. We use **__**cookies, ** _web beacons_** and similar technology to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit. We may also use _web beacons_ and similar technology in emails that we send to you in order to track whether the emails have been opened. In addition, our web servers track information about the visits to the Site. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to the Site, the daily requests we receive for particular files on the Service, and what geographical areas those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others.

  3. ### Third Party Websites

We may receive your personal data when you access or log-in to a third party website, e.g., Facebook, from our Site. This may include the text and/or images of your personal data available from the third party website.




We collect your registration and user profile data. Our servers also collect log information used to make the website faster and better. Also, to remember you, our system will give you a _cookie_. It's safe.

## Use and disclosure of your personal information

We may use and disclose your Personal Information only as follows:

  1. **To promote use of our Services**. For example, if you use any of our Services, and we think you might benefit from using another service we offer, we may send you an email telling you about it.
  2. **To send you System Alert Messages**. For example, we may let you know about temporary or permanent changes to our Services, like planned outages, new features, version updates, releases, abuse warnings, and changes to our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use.

  10. **To communicate with you about your account for informational** , not promotional, reasons.
  11. **To transfer your information in the case of a sale, merger, consolidation, or acquisition**. In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
  12. **To send you informational and promotional content that you may choose (or "opt in") to receive**. You can stop receiving our promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in every email.
