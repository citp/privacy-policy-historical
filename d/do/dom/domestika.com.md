## 2\. Legal basis for processing personal data

Collection and processing of your personal data is based primarily in the contractual and/or pre-contractual relationship you have with us.

When we send you newsletters and Services or when we use the email you have provided us to contact you individually or to recognize you when you return to visit our website, we are doing so under the informed consent.

To create your profile in the Platform you may include personal information such as your country or city of residence, a photograph, first and last names, education, work experience, and any other additional information you might want to share in your profile. The profile information helps you make the most out of our Services, like helping other professionals find you and finding business opportunities or projects you might be interested in. However, if you do not want this information to be published, you may leave the profile information fields blank or delete the information already provided.

To buy or subscribe to our courses, we will request your credit card or debit information, including expiration date and CVV. If you are paying with PayPal, we will request the email associated with it. If you are paying with PayU, we will redirect you to that payment platform.

We obtain information through other platforms, for example, when you register via Facebook or similar technologies. This might include personal texts or images available in the external website.

## 4\. Purpose

As the Data Controller, DOMESTIKA will process your personal data for the following purposes:

  1. Manage your registration as Platform user, identify and give you access to Services available to registered Platform users.

  2. The development, compliance and execution of the contract for the provision of services such as the sale of or subscription to Domestika PRO courses or any other contract We might have through the Platform. You will need to keep in mind that:

You expressly authorize us to process the data indicated as required for activation and payment processing. The card's security code (CVV or CVC) will only be used to process the purchase in course and will not be stored or processed afterwards, as part of your payment information. The consent for the activation of this feature allows your data to autofill in future purchases, so you do not need to re-enter payment information every time you make a purchase. The data entered will be assumed valid and current in future purchases. You will be able to modify or delete your credit cards or PayPal account at any time through the payment method in the purchase form or through the payment method setting in your Domestika PRO subscription. We store and release card information in accordance with international confidentiality and security standards for credit and debit cards. For security reasons, the use of this feature might require changing your password. Remember, the safety of the Platform also depends on the correct use and storage of confidential passwords.

  3. Recommending jobs that match your profile.

  4. Contacting you through email regarding updates or information related to features, products or services contracted, including Platform security updates, as long as they are needed or reasonable.

  5. Responding to any request or inquiry you make through the customer service channels available at our Platform.

  6. We also use your information to generate aggregated non-identifying data. For instance, generating statistics regarding our users, their jobs or areas of expertise, number of impressions or clicks in a specific course or project, or visitor demographics.




## 5\. Options

The provision of DOMESTIKA's Service might entail the use of your personal data, with your express consent, to make available to you personalized advertisement related to our products and services, through emails or other electronic communication means from us or third party collaborators.

Likewise, you may cancel your notifications by following the instructions in each notice you receive.
