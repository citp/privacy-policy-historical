# Domo Privacy Policy | Domo

## Scope of this Policy

Domo understands you care how information about you is collected and used. Domo is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who interact with us. This Domo Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes Domo, Inc. and its affiliated entities (collectively “Domo”) privacy practices for our websites, services, and apps that link to this policy. This policy also details our privacy practices related to Domo marketing, advertising, and company events.

The Domo Business Cloud is an online business management platform. We provide the Domo Business Cloud and related support, consulting, and other services to our customers. In this Privacy Policy, we will refer to the Domo Business Cloud and related services collectively as our "Services." We will refer to our emails, newsletters, and other marketing and advertising practices collectively as our “Communications.”

For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

### Domo Services

We provide Services to our customers. As part of the Services, customer data may be stored on our computer systems. As our customer, when you use our Services to process data you have collected, you control the data you collect, what data is uploaded to the Services, and how that data is used. The collection, use, transfer, and retention of customer data in our Services are governed by our customer’s privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy. As a data processor, we will cooperate with you in your efforts to control your data.
