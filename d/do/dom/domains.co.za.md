**General**  
When you visit our web site to read pages or download information, we automatically collect and store the following non-identifying information:  
The Internet protocol (IP) address from which you access our web site. An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to the computer you are using whenever you are surfing the web.  
The type of browser, such as Netscape or Internet Explorer, and operating system, such as Windows or Linux, used to access our sites.  
The date and time our site is accessed, for the purpose of monitoring demand.  
The pages visited, for the purpose of improving the usefulness of our web site by providing helpful links and removing pages that are not read.  
This information does not identify you personally. We maintain the above information in system logs. We use this information to make our site more useful to visitors by learning the number of visitors to our site, the number of pages served, and the level of demand for specific pages. We do not track or record information about identifiable individuals and their visits.

### Personally Identifiable Information

MegaWeb does not share, disclose or sell any personally-identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) collected online on any MegaWeb sites with other unaffiliated companies or organizations for non-MegaWeb marketing purposes. Should MegaWeb decide to share such data with third parties for marketing, it will provide notification and the opportunity for its users to indicate whether they would prefer that the MegaWeb not provide such information about them to third parties. Because this information is a critical part of our business, it would be treated like our other assets in the context of a merger, sale or other corporate reorganization or legal proceeding.   
  
If you register as a subscriber to any of our services, we do not make your personally-identifiable information available to anyone unless required by law to do so.[

### How We Use Information

MegaWeb uses the personally-identifiable information we collect online principally to provide you with the service(s) you have ordered and to let you know about other offerings which may be of interest to you. Postal and e-mail address information, for example, enables communication about services offered and ordered, as well as the proper provisioning and billing of those services.

Because MegaWeg may make special benefits available to you through relationships with other businesses , MegaWeb shares personally-identifiable online customer information with those businesses so that you receive the benefits to which you are entitled. We also sometimes use this information to extend special offers to you jointly with our partners.

Like most businesses today, MegaWeb uses vendors to carry out certain functions in marketing and delivering services to you (such as processing data files and sending you new order fulfillment information), and so shares online data with those vendors to the extent necessary for them to perform their work. Of course, such partners and vendors must use that personally-identifiable information only for the purpose(s) for which it was shared and protect it from any further use. MegaWeb also shares such information with other industry and credit-related organizations to improve operations and to protect against fraud, security and credit risks.

We also provide personally-identifiable online information in response to subpoenas and other legal demands, and where we believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against individuals who may be endangering public safety or interfering with MegaWeb property or services, or with our customers' or others' use of them.

### How We Collect Information

MegaWeb collects information online by asking you for it, for example, when you order a service, apply for a job, or respond to a survey,  or other promotion. A customer's name, address (postal and e-mail) and telephone number are the most important pieces of information, but we might request other information, based on, for example, the service(s) being ordered or promoted.

MegaWeb may also use "cookies" and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to our sites or your responses to e-mail from us - both individually and in aggregated data that does not identify you. These reporting tools tell us the parts of our web sites or e-mails in which you showed an interest or took some action, and help us improve the quality and usefulness of our sites. At MegaWeb, we primarily use cookies to determine what services or promotions you are interested in. While cookies help us improve your experience while visiting our sites and customize our communications to the services you may desire, you have the option to block them through your Internet browser or other commercially available software. However, doing so may make some of our sites' features unavailable to you.

Another way we collect information online is through our program partners who may provide us with information they already obtained from you online. For example when you are on a partner's site and click on a MegaWeb banner that takes you to a MegaWeb site, information that the partner has received from you already may be passed to MegaWeb.

**Security, Intrusion, and Detection:**  
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, our computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
