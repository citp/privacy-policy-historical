# Privacy Policy | domaindiscount24.com

On this page you find information about the handling of your data transmitted to us, based on the [ICANN Model Privacy Policy](http://www.icann.org/registrars/model-privacy-policy.htm).

On our website you are requested to transmit information

  * about the registration of a domain name,
  * about the update of a previously registered domain name,
  * about the provision of web/ and mail space or
  * in the context of other services.



In order to register domain names you have to indicate the name of the desired domain, your name and address (or the name and address of the people, for whom you apply the registration), the technical information about the computer where the domain shall be maintained and the name, address, email address, phone and - if provided - fax number for the technical, administration and billing contact of the domain. After the domain has been registered you are obligated to keep this data up to date. If you have questions we will ask you for information about the name, calling number and email address.

## Wherefore do we need this data?

The data you transmit to us upon registration (or data for correction respectively update of registrations) is required so that the domain name can be assigned to your computer on the internet, for establishing a contractual relationship between you and Key-Systems and for invoicing, so that we can manage your account properly and inform you about the expiration of the reservation of the domain and a necessary renewal, in order to make it possible for other internet user or operators with the purpose of clarifying issues related to the domain name in question to get in contact with you. Data information is also being filed in the context of a “data escrow” program in order to prolong the domain in case the registrar ceases its activity of registering and managing domain names. If you forward a question to us, we require contact information for the response.

## To whom do we forward these information?

We forward data for the registration or update respectively correction of domain names to

  * our staff and consultants,
  * the administrator of the central data base who operates the top level domain you have chosen (please see the TLD terms of registration in order to determine the registry in charge),
  * operators and user of the central internet whois data base regarding your domain registration,
  * the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) as a technical coordination authority,
  * escrow agents,
  * auditors,
  * Whois service provider and
  * as the circumstances require to registrars nominated by ICANN as an alternative.



Information you supply us with in the context of queries can be forwarded to our staff and consultants and – on demand – to ICANN.
