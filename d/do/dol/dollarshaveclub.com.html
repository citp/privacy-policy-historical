<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically.</strong>&nbsp; On our Site, we may use cookies, web beacons, and other automated devices to collect information about you when you visit our Site and register for the Site.&nbsp; Specifically, we may collect the following information about your use of the Site via these technologies:&nbsp; your domain name; your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; length of time you visit our Site; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our Site.&nbsp; Please see the section “What About Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms?” below for more information about our use of cookies and other tracking mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics and Facebook Insights, to track usage of our Site.&nbsp; We may use the information gathered through these methods in anonymous or aggregated form to analyze ways to improve our Site .&nbsp; This information may also be associated with your username or email address and may be combined with other information, including personally identifiable information that we collect about you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What About Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use cookies or other tracking mechanisms to track information, as described above, about your use of our Site.&nbsp; Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, while other cookies are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at the Site.&nbsp; There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. We also allow vendors to use cookies on our Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Session Cookies.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Session cookies exist only during an online session.&nbsp; They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.&nbsp; We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Site.&nbsp; This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.&nbsp;<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Persistent cookies.</span>&nbsp; Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.&nbsp; We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Cookies.</span>&nbsp;We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally and personally identifiable Site data.&nbsp; We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and to analyze Site usage.&nbsp; Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected.&nbsp; This Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Disabling Cookies</em>. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. &nbsp;The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site; however, some Site features may not function if you disable cookies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Local Storage Objects.</strong>&nbsp; We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) in order to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit.&nbsp; Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.&nbsp; In addition, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your browser.&nbsp; For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies, go to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">Adobe Flash Player Help Page</a>, choose “<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global Storage Settings Panel</a>“ and follow the instructions.&nbsp; To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>“ and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</strong>&nbsp; Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage.&nbsp; We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Site Analytics.</strong>&nbsp; As noted, we may use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site.&nbsp; We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Site.&nbsp; We use these tools to help us improve our Site, performance and user experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Ad Networks.</strong>&nbsp; We may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Site.&nbsp; Please see the section “What About Third-Party Ad Networks?” below for additional information about our practices and your choices with regard to receiving such advertisements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What About Third-Party Ad Networks?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may display advertisements on our Site, participate in third party ad networks and make available to our Site users specific offers from third-party companies.&nbsp; We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Sites.&nbsp; Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Sites and other websites you have visited.&nbsp; This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.&nbsp; Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.&nbsp; These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.&nbsp; We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.&nbsp; However, we will not disclose personally identifiable information to these network advertisers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks.&nbsp; The website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>&nbsp;provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by NAI members.&nbsp; You also may contact About Ads at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>&nbsp;for information about opting out of behavioral advertising and your choices regarding having information used by About Ads member companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by About Ads members.&nbsp; Opting out of one or more NAI members or About Ad members (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites.&nbsp; You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.&nbsp; Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or About Ad opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and About Ad’s websites accessible by the above links.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Use Your Information?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use the information that we gather about you for the following purposes:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>– To fulfill your orders or otherwise provide services related to your Membership to you, to communicate with you about your use of our Site, your Membership and/or products that we offer or make available through the Site, and for other customer service purposes.&nbsp;<br>–&nbsp;To respond to any inquiries you submit to us.&nbsp;<br>–&nbsp;To carry out or enforce a transaction or agreement with us.<br>–&nbsp;To operate and improve the Site.<br>–&nbsp;Where permitted by law, for marketing and promotional purposes; for example, we may use your information, such as your email address, to email you news and our newsletters, special offers, and promotions;.<br>–&nbsp;To better understand how users access and use our Site and Memberships, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, for the purposes of improving our Site and Memberships.<br>–&nbsp;We also may post to your Wall, access posts in your news feeds, and access your Facebook data when you are not logged into Facebook.&nbsp; We will use and access this information for the purposes described in this section and as discussed below.&nbsp;</p>
