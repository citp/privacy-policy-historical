DOLE.COM**

This website is owned and operated by Dole Food Company, Inc. At Dole, we recognize that many visitors to our Dole.com site are concerned about the information they provide to us and how we treat that information. In communicating directly with children over the Internet, we also recognize the unique issues raised about protecting your kids' privacy. Dole.com is designed to comply with the guidelines for web sites established by the Children's Advertising Review Unit, a division of the Better Business Bureau. We may update this Policy as new technology of the Internet becomes available.

**Privacy**  
Our overall policy is to use our best efforts to respect the privacy of all of our on-line guests. Our web server recognizes and records certain non-personal information about visitors; specifically, this information consists only of the type of browser used (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system (e.g., Windows 95, Windows 98, Macintosh) and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g., America On Line, Compuserve). This information is used only for internal review purposes such as tracking the total number of visitors to our site on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable information basis. We do not access any personally identifiable facts in this process

We do not collect personal information from visitors to our site unless it is provided to us voluntarily and knowingly. One section of our website is directed to children who are invited to visit pages devoted to BOBBY BANANA, a copyrighted fanciful banana character designed to appeal to children and to promote the consumption of bananas as a healthy food source. Visitors to these pages may receive educational information about bananas and nutrition, hear BOBBY BANANA's radio and television jingles, receive information about upcoming personal appearances by costumed BOBBY BANANA figures and participate in other non-commercial activities. These pages also include a BOBBY BANANA Fan Club which children may join by providing their first names and an e-mail address. In addition, if the registering guest is under 18 years of age, we require the child to provide his or her parent's e-mail address. The child's parent receives an e-mail alerting them to the registration and providing instructions on how the registration may be deleted, if so desired. Children are also specifically directed on this page to obtain their parents' permission before providing such personal information. Prospective Fan Club members are also advised that any personal information provided will be used solely to contact the sender about upcoming contests, Fan Club events and Fan Club related e-mail. On another page of the BOBBY BANANA section, children are invited to send an e-mail message to the character and receive a non-commercial message back. Again, this page contains an express advisory to children to obtain parental consent before providing their e-mail address and requires a parent's e-mail address. Notices are sent to the parent's e-mail address with instructions on how to remove the child from the mailing list, if so desired. Dole does not and will not use your child's e-mail address for any purpose other than responding to the message your child has sent or notifying him or her of Fan Club events of interest.

From time to time, we sponsor contests for children in the BOBBY BANANA pages. To enter, the child provides his or her first name, city and state of residence and an e-mail address. The child's first name and city and state are used solely to identify contest winners on the website and the e-mail address is used solely to enable Dole to notify contest winners. Any page in the site announcing a contest will contain an express advisory to children to obtain parental consent before providing any personal information and to include a parent e-mail address. Notices will be sent to the parents' e-mail address with instructions on how to remove the child from any contest, if the parent so wishes.

Dole does not give or sell to any one any information we may collect at our site.

**Links To Other Sites**  
The BOBBY BANANA pages of our site are not linked to other web sites except to the Dole 5 A Day web site. This link is provided for visitors who want more information about healthy and nutritious eating. We do not provide links to any other sites in these pages because we are concerned about sending any of our visitors, and especially children, to any place on the Internet where we can't be sure of its content.

**A Special Message for Parents**  
The Dole.com website is intended to be an information resource to consumers, our shareholders, and potential investors. The BOBBY BANANA pages are directed primarily to children and designed to provide activities and information for children while promoting awareness of the nutritional values associated with bananas.

In the BOBBY BANANA section of the website, plush toy dolls of two of our fruit and vegetable characters are offered for sale. The dolls may be ordered and purchased only by check through postal mail. There is no on-line ordering and children are specifically advised on this page that parental permission is necessary to make any purchases. Parents are referred to this Privacy Policy.

Dole is concerned about personal privacy and is committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit our site. We encourage children to consult with parents before furnishing any personal information and we incorporate special notices urging children to obtain parental permission on those pages of our site where children have an opportunity to provide an e-mail address. We strongly recommend parents supervise their children's Internet activities and consider using parental control tools available from on-line services and software. These tools help parents maintain an Internet environment appropriate for children. For additional information about parental control tools, we suggest you consult the Direct Marketing Association's (DMA) website at [www.the-dma.org](http://www.the-dma.org/).
