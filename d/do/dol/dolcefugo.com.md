**Our Privacy Policy**

Updated: July 1, 2008 

DolceFugo.com requests and maintains only the minimal amount of information about its clients in order to send you our goods and passes on information to our credit card processor to protect you and us against fraud. 

We do NOT retain your credit card numbers nor any checksums, codes etc. pertaining to credit cards. That information is directly communicated to our credit card processor who never shares it with us.

We will not, under any circumstances, divulge any information whatsoever to any other company or individual. (The only exception is if we are obliged to provide information by a law enforcement agency, a very remote possibility, given the innocuous nature of our products.) After we have established an affiliate program, we will also NOT share any of your information with our affiliates unless you explicitly request that we do so. 

We save e-mail and notes on correspondence with those who contact us. We also keep the contact information of those who buy our products and register with us. We do not and never will collect any other information pertaining to our clients.

When you buy one of our products, you get only the product as described. We have never and will never produce or use any spy ware or malware of any kind. 

We will send you e-mail only under the following conditions: 

  1. To provide you with the confirmation of your purchase and information pertaining to its delivery. 
  2. If you initiate the correspondence 
  3. If and only if you register and opt to receive notices, we will inform you of our sales and new products.



Under no circumstances will we send you an e-mail for any other purpose. 

Again, we will not deliberately provide of our clients' information to any other company or individual (with the exception of our credit card processor). We take reasonable steps to protect such information from hackers etc.
