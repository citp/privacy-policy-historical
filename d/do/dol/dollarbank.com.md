# Privacy Policy of Dollar Bank: Online banking in Pittsburgh and Cleveland

Dollar Bank Privacy Policy Disclosure

Effective 07/01/2007

At Dollar Bank, we take seriously our obligation to keep your information confidential. Dollar Bank will not sell or otherwise release customer information to third parties for their marketing purposes. You do not have to sign anything to get this protection. You get it automatically by being a customer of Dollar Bank.

As you know, banking requires the gathering of information about you, our customer. This information about you comes to us through applications or other forms, through your transactions with us, our affiliates and others, and from consumer reporting agencies. As a Dollar Bank customer, you expect this information to be protected. We honor this expectation with a privacy policy that provides even greater protection than is required by law and goes further than those of most other financial institutions.

Despite our commitment to protecting your information as much as we can, certain circumstances make it necessary to disclose information to others. We believe that you will agree that disclosure under the following circumstances is reasonable:

  * To make disclosures required by law, such as on receipt of a subpoena; 
  * To help prevent loss or fraud, for example by cooperating with law enforcement agencies investigating financial crimes; 
  * To meet the Bank’s obligations to credit bureaus and similar agencies, for example by reporting delinquent loans; 
  * To provide those who buy loans from the Bank with all relevant information on the loans being offered for sale; 
  * To perform services for you or the Bank, we may disclose information to parties who may or may not be affiliated with the Bank to provide those services, for example by providing your address to a check printer to print your checks; 
  * To facilitate your banking transactions, for example by authorizing a credit card purchase. 



In addition, we will protect your information. If we use others to help deliver our banking services to you, we use strict confidentiality agreements. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to protect all customer information. Dollar Bank restricts access to your information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. And we protect your information in the same way even if you stop being a customer.

On our website (dollarbank.com) we obtain information from visitors only through the use of customer initiated forms and e-mail. We do not gather data generated from "cookies" (a method for websites to recognize whether you have visited the site before) for any marketing purposes. Information is collected only when required to provide a service requested by the visitor. 

We hope you can see how much we care about protecting your privacy. This policy has not been significantly altered from its introduction in 2001, and material changes made in the future will be highlighted for you. If you have any questions regarding the use of your customer information, please contact us at 1-800-242-1616.
