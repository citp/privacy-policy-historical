      Overview</p>
    <p>The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available
      under the domain and subdomains of <a href="http://www.dollardays.com">www.dollardays.com</a> (the "Site").
      By visiting this website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions
      of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access
      our Site. <br>
      This Privacy Policy describes the information, as part of the normal operation
      of our services, we collect from you and what may happen to that information.
      Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy
      because we believe you should know as much as possible about DollarDays
  practices so that you can make informed decisions. </p>
    <p>By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration,
      you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information
      in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated
      into and subject to the terms of the DollarDays User Agreement. This Privacy
      Policy is effective upon acceptance in registration for new registering
      users, and is otherwise effective on June 6, 2005 for all users. </p>
    <p>1. A Special Note About Children.<br>
      Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use the Site
        unsupervised and we ask that children do not submit any personal information
        to us. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use this Site in
        conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians. </p>
    <p>2. Information We Collect.<br>
      Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you
        with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows
        us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs,
        and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier.
        We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary
        for achieving this purpose. </p>
    <p>In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or
      revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your
      personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use
      our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information,
      billing information, shipping information and other personal information
      as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate
      which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have
      the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular
      service or feature. </p>
    <p>Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial information,
      such as, but not limited to: if you are registering using an email account
      at a free email service. We use your financial information, including credit
      card information to verify the accuracy of your name, address, and other
      information prior to shipping your order.</p>
    <p>We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on
      the Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users'
      demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and
      serve you. This information may include the URL that you just came from
      (whether this URL is on the Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether
      this URL is on the Site or not), your computer browser information, and
      your IP address. </p>
    <p>We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain
      pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional
      effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small
      files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services.
      We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie".
      We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently
      during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is
      targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning
      that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of
      a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits,
      although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the
      Site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during
      a session. </p>
    <p>
      3. Our Use of Your Information.<br>
      We use your personal information to facilitate the services you request.
      We use your personal information in the file we maintain about you, and
      other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the
      Site to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; measure consumer interest
      in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers,
      products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and
      protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our
      User Agreement; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
      At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve
      disputes, and in particular we may examine your personal information to
      identify users using multiple User names or aliases. We may compare and
      review your personal information for errors, omissions and for accuracy. </p>
    <p>You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our
      marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content

      deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests,
      such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product
      offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting
      the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this
      information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage
      you to opt out of the receipt of certain communications on the notification
      (link to email preferences). You may make changes to your notification
      preferences at any time. </p>
    <p>4. Our Disclosure of Your Information.<br>
      As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal information
        to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.
        However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal
        information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide
        our services. </p>
    <p>Advertisers. We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal
      information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable
      manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional
      purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities
      any information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain
      information, such as your name, email address, password, credit card number,
      and bank account number, are not disclosed to these third parties in a
      personally identifiable manner without your explicit consent. </p>
    <p>Other Corporate Entities. We share much of our data, including personal
      information about you, with our subsidiaries and joint ventures that are
      related services. To the extent that these entities have access to your
      information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat
      information they obtain from their other users. Our subsidiaries and joint
      ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than
      our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable
      law. DollarDays, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, or any combination
      of such, will share some or all of your personal information with another
      business entity should we plan to, merge with, or be acquired by that business
      entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined
      entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information.
      If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you
      will receive prior notice in as provided in Section 7 ("Notice"). <br>
      Legal Requests. DollarDays cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as
      well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property
      rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you. Therefore, in response
      to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials
      relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can
      (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number,
      email address, User Name history, fraud complaints history without a subpoena.
      Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our
      ability to keep DollarDays free from bad elements we will not otherwise
      disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government
      officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal
      procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of
      information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial
      loss; or report suspected illegal activity</p>
    <p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all
      of your private communications and other personal information will never
      be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By
      way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose
      personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances,
      third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private
      communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information
      that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard
      practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not
      expect, that your personal information or private communications will always
      remain private. </p>
    <p>5. Control of Your Password.<br>
      You are responsible for all actions taken with your User Name and password.
        Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your DollarDays password
        to any third parties. If you choose to share your User Name and password
        or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible
        for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review
        that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password,
        you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may
        be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore,
        if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately
        change your password as detailed in Section 6. </p>
    <p>6. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information.<br>
      We offer you the ability to automatically review and change the information
        you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in the new information
        yourself. Generally, we will not modify your personal information based
        on your request because it is very difficult to authenticate your account
        manually. You can change your user Id, email address, contact information,
        shipping information and user preferences by going to the my account
        link You must promptly update your personal information if it changes
        or is inaccurate. </p>
    <p>Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information,
      shipping information, from our databases. To make this request, email service@dollardays.com
      Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based
      on your account activity and in accordance with our deactivation policy
      and applicable law. <br>
      We will retain in our files some personal information you have requested
      to remove to prevent fraud, collect any moneys owed, resolve disputes,
      troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User
      Agreement and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore,
      you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely
      removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such
      personal information will be deactivated and will only be available to
      select DollarDays personal. </p>
    <p>7. Notice.<br>
      We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend terms
        on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days
        after they are initially posted on the Site. In addition, we will notify
        you in accordance with your Notification Preferences. <br>
