	you to opt out of the receipt of certain communications on the notification

</div>
<div class="vs">
	<div class="un">4. Our Disclosure of Your Information.</div>
	As a matter of general policy, we do not sell but may rent some of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.
	We may send you offers from third parties in cases where we, at our sole discretion, believe the offer is both relevant and of substantive value to you.
	The following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services.
	<ul class="bullet">
		<li>
			<i>Advertisers.</i>
			We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal
			information and disclose such information to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional
			purposes. Certain information, such as your password, credit card number,
			and bank account number, are not disclosed to these third parties.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Other Corporate Entities.</i>
			We share much of our data, including personal
			information about you, with our subsidiaries and joint ventures that are
			related services. To the extent that these entities have access to your
			information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat
			information they obtain from their other users. Our subsidiaries and joint
			ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than
			our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable
			law. DollarDays, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, or any combination
			of such, will share some or all of your personal information with another
			business entity should we plan to, merge with, or be acquired by that business
			entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined
			entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information.
			If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you
			will receive prior notice in as provided in Section 7 ("Notice").
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Legal Requests.</i>
			DollarDays cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as
			well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property
			rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you. Therefore, in response
			to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials
			relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can
			(and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number,
			email address, User Name history, fraud complaints history without a subpoena.
			Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our
			ability to keep DollarDays free from bad elements we will not otherwise
			disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government
			officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal
			procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of
			information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial
			loss; or report suspected illegal activity
		</li>
	</ul>
	Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all
	of your private communications and other personal information will never
	be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By
	way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose
	personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances,
	third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private
	communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information
	that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard
	practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not
	expect, that your personal information or private communications will always
	remain private.
</div>
<div class="vs">
	<div class="un">5. Control of Your Password.</div>
	You are responsible for all actions taken with your User Name and password.
	Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your DollarDays password
	to any third parties. If you choose to share your User Name and password
	or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible
	for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review
	that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password,
	you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may
	be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore,
	if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately
	change your password as detailed in Section 6.
</div>
<div class="vs">
	<div class="un">6. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information.</div>
	We offer you the ability to automatically review and change the information
	you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in the new information
	yourself. Generally, we will not modify your personal information based
	on your request because it is very difficult to authenticate your account
	manually. You can change your user Id, email address, contact information,
	shipping information and user preferences by going to the my account
	link You must promptly update your personal information if it changes
	or is inaccurate.
	<br>
	Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information,
	shipping information, from our databases. To make this request, email service@dollardays.com
	Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based
	on your account activity and in accordance with our deactivation policy
	and applicable law.
	<br>
	We will retain in our files some personal information you have requested
	to remove to prevent fraud, collect any moneys owed, resolve disputes,
	troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User
	Agreement and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore,
	you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely
	removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such
	personal information will be deactivated and will only be available to
	select DollarDays personal.
</div>
<div class="vs">
	<div class="un">7. Notice.</div>
	We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend terms on the Site.
	All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site.
	In addition, we will notify you in accordance with your Notification Preferences.
