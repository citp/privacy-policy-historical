The games and other activities offered on the Website and Apps are referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "Services".

Please read this Policy carefully before accessing the Website, the Apps or using our Services as it provides important information about how we collect, store, use and disclose your personal and other information when providing our Services to you or when you access the Website or Apps. You should also review the [Terms of Use](http://www.doubledowninteractive.com/terms/index.html) for important information about your use of the Website or Apps and our Services.

### Types of Information We Collect

**Passive Information**  
Passive information refers to information that is automatically collected from your device(s) when you access the Website or Apps and use the Services. DoubleDown may collect passive information such as your IP address, referral data, browser type, browser language, platform type, type of mobile or other computing device, and geographical data, such as zip code and geographic location. Your browser or device typically sends passive information to our servers without your intervention whenever you visit our Website or Apps and use the Services. For example, your browser or device may tell us your IP address (which may tell us generally where you are located) and the type of browser and device you are using. When you visit our Website or Apps, your browser may also tell us information such as the page or link that led you to our Website or Apps and, if applicable, the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our Website or Apps.

**Cookies**  
While you are using the Services, we may seek to place a "cookie" (a small data file) or other tracking technology on your mobile device, computer or other participating device. If you access our Website, Apps or Services via a Partner Site, the Partner Site may also place cookies on your device as permitted by the terms of the agreement and your privacy settings with the Partner Site. Cookies placed by us are not used to obtain any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve the Services. If you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your web browser on your computer or device to reject them or to alert you before one is placed. Be advised, however, that some of our features and services may not function properly if you disable cookies.

**Personal Information**  
Personal information, which is sometimes referred to as personally identifiable information, means information that is specific to you and can be used to contact or identify you. Unless you are using the Services on a guest basis, you must have a valid, active Facebook account to use and access the Services. Accordingly, we receive from Facebook certain personal data about you that you authorize Facebook to disclose, such as your user name, date of birth, friend list, email address and profile picture, or you may voluntarily disclose information such as your gender or your play preferences to us through your use of the Services. Any information directly collected through your Facebook account and shared with us will be imported, used and stored in a manner consistent with the Facebook Platform Policy applicable to developers in effect at the time of collection (see <https://developers.facebook.com/policy/>) and in compliance with any specific privacy settings set by you of which we are aware.

We may also collect personal information from vendors that help us to operate the Website and Apps and provide services such as processing credit card payments and sending emails on our behalf. For example, we may receive confirmation that you have made a payment by credit card and other information related to any of your gaming transactions associated with your use of the Services. To help keep our databases current and to provide you the most relevant content and experiences, we may combine personal information from you with information from public sources and our trusted partners, in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy.

Please note that because a third party vendor manages your purchases of virtual currency for use the Services, we do not have access to your credit card or billing information. Be advised that this Privacy Policy does not apply to this and other third-party vendors.

### ONLINE ADVERTISING

**DoubleDown Online Advertising**  
DoubleDown utilizes online advertising, including displaying DoubleDown advertisements to you across the Internet on websites and in applications. We collect information about which of our advertisements are displayed, which advertisements are clicked on, and on which web page the advertisement was displayed.

**Third Party Advertising**  
DoubleDown permits third parties to place advertisements on our properties, including our Website, Apps and the Services. When advertisers or advertising networks place advertisements on DoubleDown properties, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our properties:

• performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);  
• aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (like players between the ages of 30 and 40 who also own a Lamborghini);  
• certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-permanent and anonymous device identifiers such as Apple Identifier For Advertisers (IDFAs), and Google Advertising ID);  
• your social network ID;  
• other contextual data about your game play (for example, games played and session length).   
After clicking on a third-party advertisement, you may no longer be on a website or other property hosted by DoubleDown or the social network through which you are playing our games. Be advised that any personal information that you disclose in connection with a third-party online advertisement is not governed by this Privacy Policy. See below for information on how to opt-out of being served online advertising by third parties.   


**Offer Walls**  
DoubleDown games or their purchase pages may display an "Offer Wall" that is hosted by a third-party provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency or other rewards to players in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These offers are not made by DoubleDown. These offers may be shown to you based on certain technical information, like your geographic area or de-identified demographic information. After clicking on one of these offers, you will no longer be on a site hosted by DoubleDown or the social network through which you are playing DoubleDown's games. To properly credit player accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your social network ID or DoubleDown player ID, will be shared with the Offer Wall provider.

These communications may also include offers from DoubleDown marketing partners, although such partners will not be provided with your personal information.

This information may also be shared with advertisers and our business partners on an aggregated anonymous basis.

**Use of Information Collected by Third Party Advertising**  
The information collected may be used to:  
• measure how effective advertisements are, to offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements for products and services that are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as behavioral advertising);  
• undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other player activity to improve your experience; and/or  
• engage in activities such as frequency capping, attribution, conversion events, estimating the number of unique users, advertising fraud detection, and debugging.  
Advertisers or advertising networks may collect the foregoing information through the use of tracking technologies like tracking pixels, browser cookies, and web beacons, and they may use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.  
If you are interested in more information about online behavioral advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering online behavioral web and mobile web advertising, you may visit the following websites:

• <http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/>

Be advised that these opt-out tools are provided by third parties, not DoubleDown, and may not be available with respect to all online advertising that is presented to you. DoubleDown does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.  
In addition, if you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in apps on your mobile device, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device. You can also reset the "Advertising Identifier" (like an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous "Advertising Identifier."

For residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), we advise that your personal information will be transferred to and processed in the United States, which has data protection laws that are different than those in your country and may not be as protective. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information or information is to do so with your consent; where we need the personal information for performance of a contract, or where the collection and use is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

We endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your Personal information and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We also take steps to minimize the risk to your rights and freedoms by not collecting or storing sensitive or special categories of Personal information about you.
