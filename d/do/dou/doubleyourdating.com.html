    	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Read very carefully:</p>
<h2>Who do we contact?</h2>
<p>David DeAngelo Marketing Inc (DDMI)
				only contacts individuals who specifically request that
				we do so or in the event that they have signed up to
				receive our free newsletters or have purchased one of our products.
				</p>
<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
<p>DDMI collects information in two categories:</p>
<p>
  <strong>1. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong>
</p>
<ul class="def">
  <li>name and e-mail address - provided by you for
				registration to receive our free newsletters.</li>
  <li>name, postal address, phone and credit card
				information -  provided by you when purchasing our
				products. </li>
  <li>demographic information - used to improve our
				marketing, products and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>All such information is strictly protected and used only for
			delivering the content and products the user has signed up for or
			purchased, or for finding other men and women who may find our
			information valuable. This information is NEVER used for other purposes and is
			NEVER shared with 3rd parties for their own use.</p>
<p>There is a single exception to this. Say you were subscribed to
			some newsletter such as "modern world fashion" and the editors ran
			a promotion of our site within it, and you followed over to our site,
			then subscribed to our newsletter, then at a later date you
			unsubscribed.</p>
<p>In that case, we have to provide back to "modern world fashion"
			your email address, so they can exclude you from our future mailings.
			No other information other than email address is provided and that
			email address is used ONLY to suppress our future emails to you.
			This scenario accounts for less than 1% of our newsletter subscribers.</p>
<p>A note about demographic information:</p>
<p>We contract with information providers that help us better understand
			people visiting our sites and advertise to those who find our content relevant. We may share
			PII with such companies provided that they have explicit policies to not share
			our data with any other parties and solely for the purpose of helping us understand
			our customers better. This technique is also called “database marketing”. It is
			practiced by virtually every US corporation. Every US consumer can
			assume that there is a fair amount of available data about them,
			including personal data such as buying preferences and education level.</p>
<p>There is no central “opt out” place that we are
			aware of. There are efforts underway to reach a standard that
			would apply automatically based on browser settings.</p>
<p>Regardless of the state of privacy as a whole, you can avoid
			us finding out extra demographic information about you by doing
			the following:</p>
<p> 1. email us using our <a href="../contact.html">
			contact page</a></p>
<p> 2. in the subject line write: “Privacy -
			opt out of demographic information”</p>
<p> 3. make sure you enter the same email that
			you provided as customer or subscriber	</p>
<p>
  <strong>2. Anonymous Usage History (non PII)</strong>
</p>
<p>This information is strictly limited to the  history of activities
			that the user engaged in while on our site.  it does NOT include any
			personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
<p>For example, the string "sub+customer" in a cookie (see below for
			what cookies are) might indicate that you are both a subscriber AND
			a customer.</p>
<p>The purpose of this information is to improve your experience.</p>
<p>For example, by storing the fact that you are already a subscriber,
			we do not need to bother you with an irrelevant  subscriber box.</p>
<p>Similarly, by noting that you are a customer, we can "bookmark"
			the last video frames you watched in our member area and remind you
			of this the next time you visit.</p>
<p>There is a small subset of this history that we use with 3rd
			parties, such as Google, for the purpose of measuring and improving
			the efficacy of advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Some of these third parties, aggregate such information across
			many websites. This allows them to identify users who are  more likely
			to be interested in specific offerings like fashion, sports, education
			and so on.</p>
<p>As an Internet user, you may experience the results of such
			aggregation by noticing how the ads displayed on Yahoo, for example,
			better match your  interests (the optimistic scenario), or at least
			more closely match a website that you recently visited.</p>
<p>Whether you find this annoying and spooky or helpful and relevant,
			or perhaps both, you are in good company. This area of Internet advertising
			is new and controversial. The tradeoff between privacy vs. commercial
			efficiency has a long history, for example the "Do not call" list.</p>
<p>In any event, it is likely that either the government or the industry
			will adopt some form of "opt out" capability in the future to address
			these concerns.</p>
<h2>What are cookies/clear GIFs and how
			do we use them?</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many other commercial sites, our site
			utilizes standard technologies called "cookies" and clear GIFs to collect
			information about how our Site is used. A cookie is a small data text file,
			which a website stores on your computer's hard drive (if your web browser
			permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies were
			designed to help a website recognize a user's browser as a previous visitor
			and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the
			user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than
			the one that set the cookie. A cookie cannot pass on a computer virus or
			capture any of the Personally Identifiable information.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Clear GIFs:</strong> At times, we work with third-party service
			partners that employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs,
			web beacons or action tags) for our benefit to help us measure advertising
			effectiveness. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar
			in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of our
			users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible
			on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of
			this sentence. Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information
			and only track the visitor traffic and behavior to and on our Site.</p>
<p>Clear GIFs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both
			from the same website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if
			a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear
			GIF, the website would match the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising
			company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer.
			This collected information can be shared with the advertising company. We do,
			at times, provide such information to our third-party advertising service partners,
			but that information never includes personally identifiable information.</p>
<h2>How do we store your email information?</h2>
<p>Your email information (email address, first name) is stored at the list
			server that delivers DDMI
			newsletters. Your information can only be accessed by those who help manage
			those lists in order to deliver e-mail to those who would like to receive
			DDMI's newsletters.</p>
<p>All of the newsletters that are sent to you by DDMI
			include an unsubscribe link in them. You can remove yourself at any time from
			our newsletters by <a href="../help/unsubscribe.html">unsubscribing here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have purchased any of my programs, you will continue to receive mailings related to
			your purchase. If you are an affiliate partner, then you will continue to receive mailings related to our affiliate program.
			If you would like to be removed from any of these mailings, please <a href="../contact.html">contact
			my support team</a> and they can assist you.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This policy may be changed at any time at DDMI's
			discretion. If we should update this policy, we will post the updates to this
			page on our Website. This policy was revised September 19, 2011.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy please
			send us your question by <a href="../contact.html">going here</a>.
