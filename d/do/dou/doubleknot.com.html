											<p><b>Privacy</b><br>
												We realize most organizations, especially those that include youth membership, 
												are very concerned about privacy.&nbsp; Keeping member information secure, and 
												using it only as our members would want us to, is a top priority. It is 
												Doubleknot's policy that all your membership information is confidential and 
												owned by your organization.&nbsp; Doubleknot does not rent, sell, or share 
												personal information about you or your organization with other people or other 
												companies except to fulfill products or services you've requested, comply with 
												law enforcement and to classify your organization in our list of member 
												organizations.&nbsp; Access by you to your Member Information is available 
												through a password and unique user ID.&nbsp; By default, from&nbsp; log in to 
												log out, all communication between our server and your browser is encrypted.
											</p>
											<p>Our list of member organizations is accessed from our home page at <a href="http://www.doubleknot.com">
													www.doubleknot.com</a>.&nbsp; If you wish to remove your organization from 
												appearing in our list of member organizations you may do so by contacting us 
												with a request to make your organization private.&nbsp; The request must come 
												from the primary contacted listed for the organization and include the 
												organization name.&nbsp; This request can also be specified in the comment 
												section of our enrollment form when enrolling your organization.</p>
											<p>We do not advertise to you, your members or anyone you choose to provide with 
												information about your organization other then to communicate to organization 
												administrator's significant changes to our service.&nbsp; When we make or plan 
												to make significant changes to our service we may inform and solicit feedback 
												from the administrator's about these changes.</p>
											<p><b>Use of cookies<br>
												</b>When you visit Doubleknot's site we use "cookies" to provide context to 
												your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your 
												browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. 
												It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.<br>
												<br>
												Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to 
												notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether 
												to accept it. Cookies are required to use Doubleknot.<br>
												<br>
												While Doubleknot uses cookies to provide context to your visit, and our Web 
												servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, Doubleknot 
												does not use this information other then to protect against ourselves and our 
												members against fraud and illegal activity.&nbsp; Doubleknot does use cookies 
												to "remember" the user ID and, if you consent, password you use to sign on to 
												the site.&nbsp; We store this information solely to make the sign on process 
												easier.&nbsp; Other cookies we use are "session only" cookies and are removed 
												then your visit to our site ends.</p>
											<p>
												<b>How We Secure Information</b>
												<br>
												Doubleknot protects information in several ways.</p>
											<p>
											When you send confidential personal information to us on our Web site, such as 
											a credit card information, member name or user ID and password, secure server 
											software which we have licensed encrypts all information you input before it is 
											sent to us. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches 
											our Web site.&nbsp; By default, when signed on or making a payment, all 
											communication with&nbsp;us is encrypted.&nbsp; Our secure communication can be 
											verified when clicking on the secure communications seal on our payment screen 
											and at sign on.</p><p>
											We also use encrypted communications to transmit information between us and our 
											service providers.&nbsp; For example, to process credit card payments we have a 
											secure connection to our payment processor.</p><p>
											For software, secure communications and service providers we only use well 
											known and established companies generally recognized a leader in their 
											field.&nbsp; For example, we use GeoTrust, Inc. technology for secure 
											communications and VeriSign, Inc. for payment processing.</p><p>
												We do not store or maintain highly sensitive information.&nbsp; This 
												information includes social security and credit card numbers.&nbsp; Where we 
												are required to collect this information to fulfill a product or service, we 
												immediately pass it on to the service provider.</p>
											<p>To safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from 
												unauthorized access or disclosure our servers are housed behind a firewall in 
												secure, restricted access&nbsp;facilities with 24 hour surveillance.&nbsp; Only 
												named and authorized representatives of Doubleknot or our facility management 
												companies can physically access our servers.&nbsp; To secure data from 
												accidental loss, alteration or destruction we back up data on our servers every 
												four hours.&nbsp; In addition, a record of all our commerce transactions are 
												also kept by our payment processor.</p>
											<p>
												All settlements for online payment taken on behalf of our member organizations 
												are securely transmitted to our bank account via Electronic Funds 
												Transfer.&nbsp; This account, with CitiBank F.S.B.,&nbsp; has specifically been 
												established to house funds from our member organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdraws 
												on this account require the signature of two company officers and internal 
												policy requires a documented funds remittance request.&nbsp; For organizations 
												that have provided us with proof&nbsp;they have a federally recognized&nbsp; 
												tax exempt status in the United States, funds collected on your behalf are 
												deposited into an interest earning escrow account in your organization's name 
												with Citibank, F.S.B.&nbsp; CitiBank F.S.B. is a part of CitiGroup, Inc.</p>
