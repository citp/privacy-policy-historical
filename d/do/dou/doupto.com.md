At DoUpTo Ltd. ("DoUpTo", "We" and "Us") user information is always kept private and secure. Our users can choose to remain anonymous even when paying or getting paid. DoUpTo provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of services, web site at: www.doupto.com ("the site"), feeds, features, content, applications or widgets, application program interfaces, application for third-party web sites and services, and any other web or mobile services or applications owned, controlled or offered by DoUpTo (collectively with the site: "The Service"). This privacy policy explains which information is collected by us when you use the service and how it is processed, used, protected and stored. We will not share your information with anyone, except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means, including offline, or from other sources. We expect users to use the service strictly for harmless and legal uses. 

2\. What Personal Information We Collect?  
Personal Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Service or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, phone number, birthday, Twitter and/or Facebook usernames, use information regarding your use of our Service, and browser information. We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the Services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and Services, and to develop new tools for the community.   
Information Collected Automatically: When you use the Service, DoUpTo automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your location, IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. We treat this data as non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. DoUpTo only uses this data in aggregate form.  
Information from other websites: We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share information with us: (1) we may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who didn't see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing, commonly known as "conversion tracking" helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see. (2) We may receive information about whether or not you've seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads. If we receive from the advertiser information we don’t already have, we will "anonimize" it for 180 days, meaning we will stop associating that information with any particular user. 

3\. How We Share Your Information?  
Personally identifiable information   
DoUpTo may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of DoUpTo (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).  
DoUpTo does not share your personally identifiable information with other, third-party companies, for their commercial or marketing use without your express consent or unless you have opted-in to be part of a specific program or feature. We cannot control third parties’ use of your information. As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.  
Sharing information in order to prevent harm and comply with the law   
Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, DoUpTo will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to:   
a) Conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities.   
b) To enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our service.   
c) To exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of DoUpTo, our Users or others.  
d) We may respect requests to disclose information from jurisdictions outside Israel, if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with the generally accepted international standards.   
e) If we have a good faith belief it is needed to prevent fraud or other illegal activity or to prevent imminent bodily harm.

DoUpTo does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent.
