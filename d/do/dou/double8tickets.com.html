			<br><b>Thank you!</b><br>
			Thank you for using Double8Tickets.com, London's favourite ticket broker. Please check your tickets immediately on receipt, as queries should be dealt with within 48 hours. <br>
			<br><b>About us</b><br>
			We are the UK's leading established ticket broker and have been trading from Charing Cross Road, London WC2 for over 15 years. We specialise in obtaining exclusive 'first 10 rows' and 'impossible to get' tickets for sold out shows, concerts and sporting events. Please not that you are often purchasing tickets above face value. This price includes service charges reflecting our costs and efforts in obtaining your premium seats. Please be aware that the ticket market is a very volatile and fluctuating market, and therefore ticket prices may vary wildly at different points in time. <br><br>
			Please also note, although we specialise in the 'First 10 rows' it does not mean all our tickets are in the 'First 10 rows'. We have different options to cater for different budgets. The option for 'First 10 rows' is always clearly shown. 'Block A' does not mean 'First 10 rows', 'Block B' does not mean 'First 10 rows'. Block behind 'VIP' does not mean 'First 10 rows' and 'General reserved' seats <strong>definitely</strong> does not mean 'First 10 rows'. If you are not sure about what option you are buying do not use this site, or telephone for clarification.<br>
			<br><b>All sales are final</b><br>
			Once an order is placed and paid for, it cannot be cancelled or refunded. Upon request we will try to resell unwanted tickets and, if successful, refund your money less a 25% handling fee. We are not responsible for lost or stolen tickets, and we regret that <span style="color:red;"><strong>WE CANNOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ISSUE DUPLICATE TICKETS. PLEASE TREAT YOUR TICKETS LIKE CASH!</strong></span>
			<p>The client should note that the right to cancel or "cooling off period" provided by the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 does not apply to the sale of event tickets. All sales are final.</p>
			<b>In the event of cancellation/rescheduling</b><br>
			If an event is cancelled by the artist or promoter, we will refund the <b>face value</b> of the ticket only. If an event is rescheduled by the artist or promoter and you cannot attend we will refund the <b>face value</b> of the tickets only. We do not have any control over these events. We will not be liable for costs of travel fares, hotels, or any other expenses that may be incurred if a concert is cancelled/rescheduled. It is your responsibility to ensure the concert is going ahead before travelling. We will do our best to inform you if the date has been changed but we do not accept liability if we are unable to contact you. We strongly advise that you check before making arrangements. <br>
			<br><b>Delivery of tickets</b><br>
			We will endeavour to deliver your tickets as soon as possible. Usually, tickets will be despatched within 7 days from the time of booking. In some cases, due to the nature of the business, tickets do not arrive with us until shortly before the concert date. This is especially common where the tickets in question are general admission (standing) tickets, or specially printed souvenir tickets. These tickets are held back by the promoter as a prevention measure against loss of tickets, fraud or counterfeiting of the tickets. In extreme circumstances, tickets do not arrive with us until the date of the show. If the tickets arrive with us too late to be posted, we will arrange for you to collect your tickets either from our London shop or from a representative at the venue.<br>
			<br><strong>Other notes</strong><br>
			If your first choice of tickets is not available we reserve the right to upgrade your seats at no extra cost, downgrade with a partial refund or offer you a ticket for the same venue/artist on a different date. If we are unable to offer you any of these alternatives we will cancel your order with a <span style="color: #FCA000;"><strong>Golden refund</strong></span>. A <span style="color: #FCA000;"><strong>Golden refund</strong></span> entitles you to a full refund of the price you paid for the tickets, plus an additional 25% on top, as our way of saying "sorry we let you down". We will also give you a free upgrade (if you choose to use us again!!) the next time you book. Odd numbers of tickets cannot be guaranteed to be together in the same row, but we will do our best. We will not be liable for any expenses. Please also note by purchasing a ticket from Double8tickets.com you are consenting to having your email address added to our mailing list. We will <strong>NOT</strong> share this information with any third parties. This information is for our use only. All prices are in UK Pounds Sterling and include VAT. (VAT no. 882 3824 01). <strong><span style="color:red; text-transform: uppercase;">Once again Lost or stolen tickets cannot be duplicated or refunded. Please treat your tickets like cash!</span></strong>
