# Double Fine™ - What is Double Fine?

Double Fine values and respects its users' privacy, and we pledge always to treat our users fairly and to manage all data responsibly. 

On some parts of our website, such as our store and our forums, we may voluntarily collect payment information in order to fulfill merchandise orders you have placed, and require registration in order to participate in community discussion. 

Some of our games and some parts of our website may collect anonymous usage information to help improve your experience. If directly relevant to the game experience, and only with your explicit permission, some games may also access personal information for purposes you have specifically allowed. No information we collect will ever be sold to a third party or used for any purpose you have not authorized. 

More detailed information about our website and games is available below: 

## DOUBLE FINE GAMES

Some games developed by Double Fine may collect anonymous usage information in order to improve performance, game design, and other parts of the gameplay experience. Any usage statistics collected by our games will always be anonymized before they are sent back to Double Fine. They will never contain personally-sensitive information, and they will never be personally identifiable. 

Some games may, only when prompted by you, access personal information such as contacts, photographs, or music, to enhance the game experience. This will never occur without your explicit permission. Such functionality is purely opt-in. 

**What anonymous information is collected?**

Double Fine games may collect gameplay data, such as how long a user plays a given game in total or in a single session, how much of a game the player has completed, what equipment the player prefers, which in-app purchases are the most popular, and so on. They may also collect technical data such as hardware specifications, error logs, and crash data. 

**What do you do with that information?**

This information will be anonymized and aggregated for analysis, and used to improve the game experience. It will never be sold to a third party. It may, however, be shared in aggregated and summarized form for use only in educational materials or trade publications. No personal information will ever be used in this way. 

**What about games that access personal information?**

Some Double Fine games might, with your direct permission, access personal data such as contacts, photos, and music, only if directly relevant to the game experience. This information will never be accessed without your explicit request. If a game does not clearly ask for permission, it will never access any such information. This is a purely opt-in process.
