# Product Privacy Policy > DoubleVerify

_Last updated – October 11th, 2011_

The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you of the type of information we may gather about you when you visit a site or see an advertisement that is verified by DoubleVerify, how we may use that information, and the choices you have regarding whether and how we gather and use information related to you.

## Collection and Use of Internet Consumer Data

We utilize tracking pixel technology, which is embedded within an advertisement, to provide our services. When an advertisement containing our tracking pixel is served on a website, the pixel will enable us to identify (i) the page URL where the ad was served and (ii) the IP address of the browser to which the advertisement was served. This information is aggregated in our system and is not combined with any other external data. This function is usually performed in approximately one tenth of one second and our pixel does not place a cookie or any other similar mechanism on your computer. Further, we do not utilize any consumer data tracking technologies and does not link to, attempt to link to, collect or maintain any personally identifiable information. We does not share any information collected with anyone except as is necessary to perform the services for which we had been contracted or in an aggregated manner without identifying any of the parties involved.

We do not directly collect personally identifiable information (“PII”). PII generally includes information that could be used by us to determine the identity of an online consumer, such as name, address, phone number and email address. We use the information we collect for the sole purpose of helping our clients verify the proper delivery of their advertisements and improve their online advertising efforts. None of the Non-PII data is linked to the IP addresses and we make no attempt to link IP addresses to the individuals who visit sites or see advertisements that are verified by us.

## We use web beacons in our services

We employ Web beacons in order to provide our clients with verification services. A Web beacon, or action tag, is a piece of HTML code that can be placed on a Web page. When your Internet browser loads that page, a request is made to a server and the server sends a response back to the page.

## Policy Changes

DoubleVerify may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time without the consent of users by providing advance notice on our Web site before implementing such modifications.
