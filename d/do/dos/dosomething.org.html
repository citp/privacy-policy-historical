  <div class="content">    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>Do Something is a not-for-profit organization for teens that want to change our world. This site is designed to offer resources to help teens change our world and has established online security measures to ensure the safety of every user.</p>
<p> Do Something has a privacy policy. It was created by the Do Something Board of Directors in Summer 2003 to protect one of our greatest assets: your trust. We’ve created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy. The following discloses our online information gathering and dissemination practices.</p>
<p> Our promise about your personal information: If we collect information from you, we use it only for the purposes for which it was collected, and the other limited purposes outlined below. We will not sell or share your personally identifiable information with any third party.</p>
<p>  Here are the details of our privacy  policies. This statement may change over time -- please review it periodically. </p>
<h2>Types of Information Collected; Uses of Information</h2>
<p>We collect some non-personally identifiable information automatically and some in our registration forms and online surveys. Certain, non-personally identifiable information  (including, but not limited to, your IP address, the type of browser  and operating system you are using, the domain name from which you linked to our site) might be collected by our web servers to help diagnose technical problems and to help administer our website. We may share this information with our other business partners on an aggregated basis or for the expressed purposes of web site functionality.</p>
<p> Our site's registration form and online surveys may request or require users to give us personally identifiable information (like their name, telephone number, home address and e-mail address). </p>
<p>We may use the information from our registration forms and surveys to contact the user, but users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). We will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable data to any third party unless we first obtain explicit permission from you. For instance: sometimes journalists want to talk with our BRICK Award winners (and other all-stars). Even that info we don’t hand out without express written permission.</p>
<p> </p><hr>   <p></p>
<p><a name="cookies" title="cookies"></a><br>
</p><h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>We may use "cookies" to determine whether you have visited our site previously and to save and remember any preferences that you set while using our site. Our cookies cannot retrieve any other data from a hard drive or obtain an e-mail address. Although a user has the ability to modify most browsers to either accept all cookies, notify the user when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize certain services at dosomething.org if cookies are rejected.</p>
<p>   <a name="links" title="links"></a></p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p> Do Something only links to other non-profit or for-profit organizations that qualify as strategic partners. This site contains links to other sites. Do Something is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. </p>
<p>  <a name="usergenerated" title="usergenerated"></a><br>
</p><h2>User Generated Content</h2>
<p> The views, opinions, and comments expressed on our message boards DO NOT reflect the views and opinions of Do Something as an organization. Do Something is a not-for-profit and does not directly support or push any political, social, or religious agendas. We love all of our users equally.<br>
</p><h3>Message Boards </h3>
<p><strong>Message Board  Do’s</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use message boards to discuss causes you care about</li>
<li>Have open, honest debates about issues that matter</li>
<li>Post opinions, information and news summaries  relevant to making the world a better place</li>
<li>Report messages that violate our policy</li>
<li>Use message boards to give Do Something feedback on  its completely flawless website</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message Board  Don’ts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Share personal or private info</li>
<li>Threaten fellow message boarders</li>
<li>Offend any specific race,  religion, sexual orientation, or culture</li>
<li>Post or distribute sexually  explicit, vulgar, or obscene content</li>
<li>Impersonate another message  boarder, Do Something Staff Member, or anyone else you are not</li>
<li>Post copyrighted material or  material created by others with out direct permission</li>
<li>Post direct solicitations for  funds or advertisements for any goods or services</li>
<li>Post offensive material of any  kind</li>
<li>Post links to external websites </li>
</ul>
<p>Do Something can decide, in its sole discretion, what is inappropriate for our message boards and can send users to the Sin Bin (restrict your access) or delete your account at any time. </p>
<p><strong>Message Board Link Policy = Do not directly link to  external sites</strong></p>
<p>2 Reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not want our message boards to become a junkyard of random links. Over time news articles and other web links on any service change, by properly quoting or summarizing articles, posts will be clearer and will last longer as a resource for other members.  </li>
<li>Safety, we only want to link to approved       (partnered) organizations that have passed our partnership criteria. </li>
</ul>
<p>Direct site addresses will  be edited, or rephrased on a case by case basis by Do Something moderators.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Consequences –the Sin Bin</h3>
<p>Users that post 3 or more messages that violate the ‘Do’s and Don’ts’ of the message board will be emailed and then get their accounts suspended for 2 weeks. Further violations of message board policy will result in permanent suspension of the user’s account and blocking of user’s IP address.</p>
<h3>Moderation</h3>
<p>Every member of the Do Something community acts as a moderator through the abuse-reporting system. Members are asked to ‘if they see something, do something’ about message board abuse. </p>
<p>There is one full time (super sweet) Do Something staff member who moderates users, content and content policy. This staff member oversees a network of volunteer youth moderators that monitor every post for content and edit/hide/delete messages where appropriate. </p>
<p>In the case of a message that suggests a user may be in danger (either from themselves or someone else), they will be referred to a Do Something approved emergency help line or appropriate organization. This information will be publicly available and all moderators are authorized to refer users to these pre-approved services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Childhelp</li>
<li>National Alcohol Hotline</li>
<li>Alcoholism Council of New York</li>
<li>National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug       Abuse Information</li>
<li>National Eating Disorders Association</li>
<li>Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network</li>
<li>The Trevor Project</li>
<li>America’s Pregnancy Helpline</li>
<li>National Runaway Switchboard</li>
<li>National Suicide Hotline</li>
<li>National Alliance       for the Mentally Ill</li>
<li>KIDS Helpline</li>
<li>Covenant House</li>
<li>Girls and Boys Town</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comment Fields</h3>
<p>These are the areas for users to add input to causes and say something to people who post projects. These areas all have the same rules that apply for the message boards and will also be monitored to maintain relevant content and foster a positive community. </p>
<p><a name="security" title="security"></a></p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p> While there is no such thing as "perfect" security on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of your personally identifiable information. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. However, we do not assume any liability for third-party usage of your personal information, whether obtained legally or illegally from our system.</p>

</p><h2>Parents/Teachers/Old people/other?</h2>
<p> Do Something.org is not really for you. But we still care about you, so please check out the “Old People” on the bottom of every page. Do Something seeks to collect information from children over the age of 13. With respect to minors between the ages of 13 and 18, it is our hope that children participate in Do Something with the blessings of parents and guardians, but also that these parents and guardians become involved with Do Something too! If any child (13-18) provides us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian may notify us and such information will be deleted from our records. <br>   <a name="optout" title="optout"></a><br>
</p><h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>
<p>Users have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor. To opt-out, please email <a href="mailto:help@dosomething.org">help@dosomething.org</a>.</p>
