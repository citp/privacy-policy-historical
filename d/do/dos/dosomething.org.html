    <p>DoSomething.org is a not-for-profit organization for teens that want to change our world. This site is designed to offer resources to help teens change our world and has established online security measures to ensure the safety of every user.</p>
<p> DoSomething.org has a privacy policy. It was created by the Do Something Board of Directors in Summer 2003 to protect one of our greatest assets: your trust. We’ve created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy. The following discloses our online information gathering and dissemination practices.</p>
<p> Our promise about your personal information: If we collect information from you, we use it only for the purposes for which it was collected, and the other limited purposes outlined below. We will not sell or share your personally identifiable information with any third party.</p>
<p>  Here are the details of our privacy  policies. This statement may change over time -- please review it periodically. </p>
<h3>Types of Information Collected; Uses of Information</h3>
<p>We collect some non-personally identifiable information automatically and some in our registration forms and online surveys. Certain, non-personally identifiable information  (including, but not limited to, your IP address, the type of browser  and operating system you are using, the domain name from which you linked to our site) might be collected by our web servers to help diagnose technical problems and to help administer our website. We may share this information with our other business partners on an aggregated basis or for the expressed purposes of web site functionality.</p>
<p> Our site's registration form and online surveys may request or require users to give us personally identifiable information (like their name, telephone number, home address and e-mail address). </p>
<p>We may use the information from our registration forms and surveys to contact the user, but users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). We will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable data to any third party unless we first obtain explicit permission from you. For instance: sometimes journalists want to talk with our BRICK Award winners (and other all-stars). Even that info we don’t hand out without express written permission.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="cookies" title="cookies"></a><br>
</p><h3>Cookies</h3>
<p></p><p>We may use "cookies" to determine whether you have visited our site previously and to save and remember any preferences that you set while using our site. Our cookies cannot retrieve any other data from a hard drive or obtain an e-mail address. Although a user has the ability to modify most browsers to either accept all cookies, notify the user when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize certain services at dosomething.org if cookies are rejected.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p> DoSomething.org only links to other non-profit or for-profit organizations that qualify as strategic partners. This site contains links to other sites. DoSomething.org is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. </p>
<p>  <a name="usergenerated" title="usergenerated"></a><br>
</p><h3>User Generated Content</h3>
<p></p><p>The views, opinions, and comments expressed on our message boards DO NOT reflect the views and opinions of DoSomething.org as an organization. DoSomething.org is a not-for-profit and does not directly support or push any political, social, or religious agendas. We love all of our users equally.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</strong></p>
<p>A. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in<br>
writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):</p>
<ul>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</li>
<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;</li>
<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;</li>
<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
<li>DoSomething.org's designated Copyright Agent to<br>
receive notifications of claimed infringement is Peter Weinberg, 200 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10166, email: <a href="mailto:copyright@dosomething.org">copyright@dosomething.org</a>, fax: 212-254-2391. For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright<br>
Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to DoSomething.org user relations through <a href="mailto:user@dosomething.org">user@dosomething.org</a>. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 5(D),<br>
your DMCA notice may not be valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>B. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following<br>
information to the Copyright Agent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
<li>Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and</li>
<li>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in New York, New York, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, DoSomething.org may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the<br>
Content provider, member or user, the removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at DoSomething.org's sole discretion.</p>
<p>Content and pictures posted on DoSomething.org may be reused across the site and in promotional materials. DoSomething reserves the right to use photographs uploaded to the site in order to promote and publicize itself and its mission. If you have questions email <a href="mailto:help@dosomething.org">help@dosomething.org</a></p>
<h3>Message Boards </h3>
<p><strong>Message Board  Do’s</strong></p>
<ul class="logolist">
<li>Use message boards to discuss causes you care about</li>
<li>Have open, honest debates about issues that matter</li>
<li>Post opinions, information and news summaries  relevant to making the world a better place</li>
<li>Report messages that violate our policy</li>
<li>Use message boards to give DoSomething.org feedback on  its completely flawless website</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message Board  Don’ts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Share personal or private info</li>
<li>Threaten fellow message boarders</li>
<li>Offend any specific race,  religion, sexual orientation, or culture</li>
<li>Post or distribute sexually  explicit, vulgar, or obscene content</li>
<li>Impersonate another message  boarder, DoSomething.org Staff Member, or anyone else you are not</li>
<li>Post copyrighted material or  material created by others with out direct permission</li>
<li>Post direct solicitations for  funds or advertisements for any goods or services</li>
<li>Post offensive material of any  kind</li>
<li>Post links to external websites </li>
</ul>
<p>DoSomething.org can decide, in its sole discretion, what is inappropriate for our message boards and can send users to the Sin Bin (restrict your access) or delete your account at any time. </p>
<p><strong>Message Board Link Policy = Do not directly link to  external sites</strong></p>
<p>2 Reasons why:</p>
<ul class="logolist">
<li>We do not want our message boards to become a junkyard of random links. Over time news articles and other web links on any service change, by properly quoting or summarizing articles, posts will be clearer and will last longer as a resource for other members.  </li>
<li>Safety, we only want to link to approved       (partnered) organizations that have passed our partnership criteria. </li>
</ul>
<p>Direct site addresses will  be edited, or rephrased on a case by case basis by DoSomething.org moderators.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Consequences –the Sin Bin</h3>
<p>Users that post 3 or more messages that violate the ‘Do’s and Don’ts’ of the message board will be emailed and then get their accounts suspended for 2 weeks. Further violations of message board policy will result in permanent suspension of the user’s account and blocking of user’s IP address.</p>
<h3>Moderation</h3>
<p>Every member of the DoSomething.org community acts as a moderator through the abuse-reporting system. Members are asked to ‘if they see something, do something’ about inappropriate content. When inappropriate user generated content is found the owner is contacted and the post is edited or removed as needed.</p>
<p>There is one full time DoSomething.org staff member who moderates users, content and content policy. This staff member oversees a network of volunteer youth moderators that monitor every post for content and edit/hide/delete messages where appropriate. </p>
<p>In the case of a message that suggests a user may be in danger (either from themselves or someone else), they will be referred to a DoSomething.org approved emergency help line or appropriate organization. This information is publicly available and all moderators are authorized to refer users to these pre-approved services: <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/hotlines" title="http://www.dosomething.org/hotlines">http://www.dosomething.org/hotlines</a></p>
<ul class="logolist">
<li>Childhelp</li>
<li>National Alcohol Hotline</li>
<li>Alcoholism Council of New York</li>
<li>National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug       Abuse Information</li>
<li>National Eating Disorders Association</li>
<li>Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network</li>
<li>The Trevor Project</li>
<li>America’s Pregnancy Helpline</li>

<li>National Alliance       for the Mentally Ill</li>
<li>KIDS Helpline</li>
<li>Covenant House</li>
<li>Girls and Boys Town</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comment Fields</h3>
<p>These are the areas for users to add input to causes and say something to people who post projects. These areas all have the same rules that apply for the message boards and will also be monitored to maintain relevant content and foster a positive community. </p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p> While there is no such thing as "perfect" security on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of your personally identifiable information. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These measures include dedicated fire walled servers, password encrypted SQL databases, and restrictions on user-to-user data visibility. However, we do not assume any liability for third-party usage of your personal information, whether obtained legally or illegally from our system.</p>

</p><h2>Parents/Teachers/Old people/other?</h2>
<p></p><p>DoSomething.org is not really for you. But we still care about you, so please check out the “Old People” on the bottom of every page. DoSomething.org seeks to collect information from children over the age of 13. With respect to minors between the ages of 13 and 18, it is our hope that children participate in DoSomething.org with the blessings of parents and guardians, but also that these parents and guardians become involved with DoSomething.org too! If any child (13-18) provides us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian may notify us and such information will be deleted from our records. <br>   <a name="optout" title="optout"></a><br>
</p><h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>
<p></p><p>Users have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor. To opt-out, please email <a href="mailto:help@dosomething.org">help@dosomething.org</a>.</p>
