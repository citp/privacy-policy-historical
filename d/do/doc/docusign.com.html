											<p><strong>1. Information We Collect.</strong><br>
											  Our primary purpose in collecting
										    personal information is to provide
										    you with a safe, secure online application
										    which will assist you in sending
											    and signing contracts. In order
											    to do so, DocuSign must collect information to identify users,
										    and to allow our users to identify
											    each other. We only collect information
											    about you that we consider
										    necessary for achieving this purpose.</p>
											<p>In
											    general, you can browse the Site
											  without telling us who you are or
										    revealing any personal information
										    about yourself. Once you give us
										    your personal information, you are
											    not anonymous to us. If you choose
										    to use our services, we may require
										    you to provide contact and
										    identity information, billing
										    information, shipping information
										    and other personal information as
										    indicated on the forms throughout
										    the Site. Where possible, we indicate
											    which fields are required and
											  which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide
										    information by choosing
										    not to use a particular service or
										    feature.<br>
										    Under some circumstances or users
										    may require some additional information
										    in order to authenticate you such
										    as, but not limited to: your name,
										    your address, or the last 4 digits
										    of your social security number. We
										    may also use financial information, including credit card
										    information to verify the accuracy
										    of your name, address, and other
										    information, as well as to bill you
										    for your use of our services.
										    Under no circumstances will any
										    of this information be used to generate
										    a credit scoring report that will
										    show up against your credit.</p>
											<p>We automatically
										    track certain information to increase
											  security such as IP addresses,
										  email addresses, and other information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
											<p>We may use data collection
											  devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site
											  to help analyze our web page flow,
											  measure effectiveness, and promote trust
										    and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your
										    hard drive that assist us in providing
										    our services. We offer certain features
										    that are only available through the use of a "cookie".
										    We also use cookies to allow you
										    to enter your password less frequently
										    during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information
										    that is targeted to your interests.
										    Most cookies are "session
										    cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from
										    your hard drive at the end of a session.
										    You are always free to decline our
										    cookies if your browser permits, although in that case
										    you may not be able to use certain
										    features on the Site and you may
										    be required to reenter your password more frequently during
										    a session.</p>
											<p>Additionally, the DocuSign
										    Express™ client is loaded on your
										    computer if you wish to send documents
										    for signature. This client is also governed by this Privacy policy.<br>
										    If you establish a credit account
										    with us to pay the fees we charge,
										    we collect some additional information,
										    such as a billing address, a credit
										    card number and a credit card expiration
										    date and tracking information from
										    checks or money orders.</p>
											<p>If you use
										    DocuSign to send documents we will
											  encrypt and store these documents in an account and make the contents
										    available only to those whom you
										    invite to view or sign these files.
										    DocuSign employees do not have access
										    to this information, nor can they
										    access your signature file or other
										    data, but it is stored in our system.<br>
										    If you send us personal correspondence,
										    such as emails or letters, we may
										    collect such information into a file
										    specific to you.</p>
											<p>If you register for
										    DocuSign on another web site or use
											  a web site providing a service
											  for DocuSign or a web site that helps facilitate your activity
										    on DocuSign, that web site may provide
										    personal information about you and
										    your transactions back to DocuSign.</p>
											<p><strong>2.
											  Our Use of Your Information.</strong><br>
											  We use your personal information
										    to facilitate the services you request.
										    We use your personal information
										    in the file we maintain about you,
										    and other information we obtain from
										    your current and past activities
										    on the Site to: resolve disputes;
										    troubleshoot problems; help promote
										    safe exchange of documents for signature
										    and delivery; collect fees owed;
										    authenticate users, inform you about
											  online and offline offers, products,
											  services, and updates; customize your experience;
										    detect and protect us against error,
										    fraud and other criminal activity;
										    enforce our User Agreement; and as
										    otherwise described to you
										    at the time of collection. At times,
										    we may look across multiple users
										    to identify problems or resolve disputes,
										    and in particular we may examine
										    your personal information
										    to identify users using multiple
										    User IDs or aliases. We may compare
										    and review your personal information
										    for errors, omissions and for accuracy.</p>
											<p>If
											  you choose to use our service and
											  pay with credit card or corporate
											  invoice, we use your address and billing information to bill you
											  and
										    provide associated support.</p>

											  Disclosure of Your Information.</strong><br>
											  As a matter of policy, we do not
										    sell or rent any of your personal
										    information to third parties for
										    their marketing purposes without
										    your explicit consent. However, the
										    following describes some of the
										    ways that your personal information
										    may be disclosed in the normal
										    scope of business to provide our
										    services.</p>
											<p>Internal Service Providers
											  for Our Operations. We may use
											  third parties that we refer to
											  as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource
										    one or more aspects of the business,
										    product and service operations that
										    we provide to you (e.g., search technology,
										    authentication systems, bill collection,
										    and fraud detection) and therefore
										    we may provide some of your personal
										    information directly to these internal
										    service providers. These internal
										    service providers' are subject to
										    confidentiality agreements with us
											  and other legal restrictions that
											  prohibit their use of the information
											  we provide them for any other purpose except
											  to facilitate the specific outsourced
											  DocuSign related operation, unless
											  you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to
										    them for additional uses.</p>
											<p>Legal Requests.<strong> </strong>DocuSign cooperates with law enforcement
											  inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce
										    laws, such as: intellectual property
										    rights, fraud and other rights, to
										    help protect you and the DocuSign
										    community from bad actors. Therefore,
										    in response to a verified request
										    by law enforcement or other government
										    officials relating to a criminal
										    investigation or alleged illegal
										    activity, we can (and you authorize
										    us to) disclose your name, city,
										    state, telephone number, email address,
										    UserID history, fraud complaints,
											  usage history without a subpoena.
											  Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your
										    privacy and our ability to keep the
										    community free from bad actors, we
										    will not otherwise disclose your
										    personal information to law
										    enforcement or other government officials
										    without a subpoena, court order or
										    substantially similar legal procedure,
										    except when we believe in good faith
										    that the disclosure of information
										    is necessary to: prevent imminent
										    physical harm or financial loss;
										    or report suspected illegal activity.
										    Further, we can (and you authorize
										    us to) disclose your name,
										    street address, city, state, zip
										    code, country, phone number, email,
										    and company name to DocuSign Internal
										    Service Providers under confidentiality
										    agreement,
										    as we in our sole discretion believe
										    necessary or appropriate in connection
										    with an investigation of fraud, intellectual
										    property infringement, piracy, or
										    other unlawful activity.<br>
										    Due to the existing regulatory environment,
										    we cannot ensure that all of your
										    private communications and other
										    personal information will never be
										    disclosed in ways not otherwise described
										    in this Privacy Policy. Therefore,
										    although we use industry standard
										    practices to protect your privacy,
										    we do not promise, and you should
										    not expect, that your personal information
										    or private communications will always
										    remain private, but you should know
										    that we will take all reasonable
										    steps to provide you a highly secure
										    environment.</p>
											<p><strong>4. Your Use of Other
										    Users' Information.</strong><br>
										    In order to facilitate interaction
										    among all DocuSign Express™ members, our Product may allow
										    you limited access other users' contact
										    and authentication status information.</p>
											<p>By entering into our User
										    Agreement,
										    you agree that, with respect to other
										    users' information that you obtain
										    through the Site or through an DocuSign-
										    related communication or DocuSign-facilitated
										    transaction, DocuSign hereby grants
										    to you a license to use such information
										    only for: (a) DocuSign- related communications
										    that are not unsolicited commercial
										    messages, (b) using services offered
										    through DocuSign (e.g. document sending,
										    signing, notarizing, etc), and (c)
										    any other purpose that a user expressly
										    agrees to after you tell them the
										    purpose you would like to use it
										    for. In all cases, you must give
										    users an opportunity to
										    withdraw consent to sign electronically.
										    In addition, under no circumstances,
										    except as defined in this Section,
										    can you disclose personal information
										    about another
										    user to any third party without our
										    consent and the consent of that
										    user. You agree that other users
										    may use your personal information
										    to communicate with you
										    in accordance with this Section.</p>
											<p>DocuSign
											  and our users do not tolerate spam.
											  Therefore, without limiting the
											  foregoing, you are not licensed to send any message to another DocuSign
										    user, (email or physical mail) without
										    their express consent. To report
										    DocuSign related spam to DocuSign,
										    please contact us at <a href="mailto:%20info@docusign.com">info@docusign.com</a>.</p>
											<p><strong>5.
											  Control of Your Password.</strong><br>
											  You are responsible for all actions
										    taken with your User ID and password,
										    including fees charged to your account,
										    and all actions taken with your account.
										    Therefore we do not recommend that
										    you disclose your DocuSign password
										    to any third parties. If you lose
										    control of your password, you may
										    lose substantial control over your
										    personal information and may be subject
										    to legally binding actions taken
										    on your behalf. Therefore, if your
										    password has been compromised for
										    any reason, you should immediately
										    change your password.</p>
											<p><strong>6. Accessing,
											  Reviewing and Changing Your Personal
											  Information.</strong><br>
											  We offer you the ability to automatically
										    review and change the information
										    you submit to us by logging into
										    the Site and entering in the new
										    information yourself. Generally,
										    we will not modify your personal
										    information based on your request
										    because it is difficult to authenticate
										    your account manually. You can change
										    your password, contact information,
										    financial information, and user preferences
										    by going the profile area. You must
										    promptly update your personal information
										    if it changes or is inaccurate. Changing
										    your personal information
										    will not impact any completed
										    transactions.</p>
											<p>Upon your request, we
											  will deactivate your account, contact
											  information, billing information,
											  shipping information, and financial information from our
										    active databases. To make this request,
										    email sales@DocuSign.com. Such information
										    will be deactivated as soon as reasonably
										    possible based on your
										    account activity and in accordance
										    with our deactivation policy and
										    applicable law.</p>
											<p>We will retain in
											  our files some personal information,
											  and past document transactions
											  to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes,
										    troubleshoot problems, assist with
										    any investigations, enforce our User
										    Agreement and comply with legal requirements
										    as is permitted by law. Therefore,
										    you should not expect that all of
										    your personal information will be
										    completely removed from our databases
										    in response to your requests. However,
										    such personal information will be
										    deactivated from member viewing and
										    will only be available to select
										    DocuSign personal.</p>
											<p><strong>7. Other Information
											  Collectors.</strong><br>
											  Except as otherwise expressly included
										    in this Privacy Policy, this document
										    only addresses the use and disclosure
										    of information we collect from you.
										    To the extent that you disclose your
										    information to other parties using
										    our system, different rules may apply
										    to their use or disclosure of the
										    information you disclose to them.
										    Since DocuSign does not control the
										    privacy policies of third parties,
										    or other individuals actions, you
										    are subject to the privacy policies
										    of that third party or individuals.
										    We encourage you to be sure the recipients
										    are authenticated to your satisfaction
										    before you send them any documents.</p>
											<p><strong>8.
											  Security.</strong><br>
											  Your information is stored on DocuSign
										    Inc.'s servers located in the United
										    States. We use procedural and technical
										    safeguards to protect your personal
										    information against loss or theft
										    as well as unauthorized access and
										    disclosure to protect your privacy,
										    including encryption, "firewalls" and
										    Secure Socket Layers. We treat data
										    as an asset that must be protected
										    against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different
										    security techniques to protect such
										    data from unauthorized access by
										    users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect
										    security" does not exist on the Internet.</p>
											<p><strong>9. Notice.</strong><br>
										      We may amend this Privacy Policy
										      at any time by posting the amend
										      terms on the Site. All amended
											      terms shall automatically be effective
										      30 days after they are initially
										      posted on the Site. In addition,
										      we will notify you in accordance
										      with the law.</p>
