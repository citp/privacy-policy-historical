We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a timestamp for the request.

We ask you to log in and provide certain personal information (such as your name and email address) in order to be able to save your profile and the documents and comments associated with it.  In order to enable these or any other login based features, we use cookies to store session information for your convenience. You can block or delete cookies and still be able to use Docracy, although if you do you will then be asked for your username and password every time you log in to the Website. In order to take advantage of certain features of the Website, you may also choose to provide us with other personal information, such as your picture or personal website, but your decision to utilize these features and provide such data will always be voluntary.

With respect to any documents you may choose to upload to Docracy, , we take the privacy and confidentiality of such documents seriously. We encrypt all documents, and permanently delete any redacted edits you make to documents. If you choose to make a document public, we recommend you redact any and all references to people and addresses, as we can't protect public data and we are not responsible for any violation of privacy law you may be liable for.

We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including personal information. 

**We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent** , unless:

  * doing so is appropriate to carry out a user’s request;
  * we believe it's needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;

  * otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.

Docracy may contact you, by email or other means.

Docracy may also use technology to alert us via a confirmation email when you open an email from us.

Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
