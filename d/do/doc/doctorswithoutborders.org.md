# MSF-USA: Website Privacy Policy

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) USA, Inc. ("Doctors Without Borders") has created this statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy during your visits to our sites, including doctorswithoutborders.org and refugeecamp.org. Doctors Without Borders does not collect any personally identifying information from you when you visit our sites unless you choose to provide such information to us. 

**Normal Browsing**

You can browse the Doctors Without Borders sites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. The information we gather during normal browsing comes from two sources: standard server logs collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address, domain name, browser type, operating system, and information such as the site that referred you to us, the files you downloaded, the pages you visited, and the dates/times of those visits. 

Additionally, if you have come into the site from one of our newsletters or from a site that has requested a link to us, we will ask your browser to accept a cookie that carries a general marketing source code with you as you browse through the site, in order to help us match referring sites to donations made. This cookie does not capture or hold any personally identifying information about you, and is deleted when you end your session by leaving our site or closing your browser. 

**Online Forms**

When you send personal information to us (for example, your name, address, telephone number, email address, and financial/banking information) by submitting an online form on our site, the information you transmit to us travels by high grade encryption using the https protocol. The companies we work with to process your online donation payments also use high grade encryption and security protocols. Whenever Doctors Without Borders hires other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and allow us to audit them for compliance. The information you provide is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by designated employees trained in the proper handling of customer information, and is used only for the stated purpose for which the information was collected. 

The information you send us will be used to facilitate your donations and to enable us to communicate with you about them. In addition, we may use such information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and offerings, and customize our site's content, layout and services. Doctors Without Borders does not sell, share, or rent your information to others for their use. We will only release personal information to another person or company with your consent, or to the extent required by law. 

We work to process and maintain accurately the information that you share with us. If you have donated to us, you are invited to use this form to contact us to let us know of any errors or changes in your information. 

**Cookies**

Cookies are small text files that a site transfers to a site visitor's hard disk or browser for added functionality, or for tracking site usage. Doctors Without Borders uses cookies in a limited capacity. Doctors Without Borders' cookies "expire" at the end of your user session. Our cookies do not capture or store any personally identifying information about you, or any data about your past usage of our site. We use information captured by cookies only for blind statistical analysis, and to tailor our communications with the public. 

**External Links**

This site contains links to other sites. Unless we expressly state otherwise, Doctors Without Borders makes no representations whatsoever concerning the content of those sites. The fact that Doctors Without Borders has provided a link to a site is not an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation with respect to such site, its owners, or its providers. There are risks associated with using any information, software, or products found on the Internet, and Doctors Without Borders cautions you to make sure that you understand these risks before retrieving, using, relying upon, or purchasing anything via the Internet. 

In addition, we encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information. These other sites may collect or solicit personal data or send their own cookies to your computer. Please be aware that Doctors Without Borders is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. Our privacy policy applies to all web pages under our domains, and not to any web pages not under our domains, irregardless of any hyperlinks from a web page under our domains to a webpage not under our domains. Please check the privacy statements of these other sites for more information about their policies on collection and use of personal information. 

**NOTE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN**

Doctors Without Borders welcomes children to learn more about our organization and about the humanitarian and medical issues presented on the Doctors Without Borders sites, and we are particularly respectful of the privacy of our young users. We encourage parents to monitor their children's use of the Internet and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without permission. We will never attempt to extract unnecessary information from our users, regardless of age. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with such information without consent, we will use our best efforts to remove such information from our files. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided such information to us, he or she should contact us at [webmaster@doctorswithoutborders.org](mailto:webmaster@doctorswithoutborders.org). 

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

Doctors Without Borders may amend this privacy policy from time to time. If we make any significant changes in the way we use your personal information, we will alert you by posting a prominent notice on our site.
