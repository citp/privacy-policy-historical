# Our Privacy Policy & Terms of Use

**Privacy Policy**

We at Doctors Health Press have a strict anti-spam, anti-spyware, and anti-adware policy. Your privacy is important to us! We realize how important your privacy is to you, and that is why we will never sell your e-mail address.

Some sections of this web site may require you to submit information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as the free Doctors Health Press e-Bulletin subscriptions, health tips, order processing, etc.) or to participate in a particular activity (such as a contest or other sales promotions). Your e-mail address may be added to our Doctors Health Press e-Bulletin subscription.

When you subscribe to the Doctors Health Press e-Bulletin, we will send you a welcome e-mail introducing you to the Doctors Health Press e-Bulletin. Subscribers will occasionally receive information on health topics, products, services, and special deals. We may enter into marketing relationships or joint ventures with third-party advertisers or other companies that provide products or services that we believe may be of interest to Doctors Health Press e-Bulletin subscribers. They may periodically send information to newsletter subscribers.

**Information Collection:**

We may gather general information about our web site users and their usage of the web site. This information includes IP address, pages viewed, number of visitors, purchases made, etc. Cookies are used to help provide us with this information regarding the user interaction with the web site.

**1) Types of Information We Collect:**

We collect personal information from you and any devices (including mobile devices) you use when you purchase products, subscribe to the e-mail list, or use our services. Some of this personal information, such as a way to identify you, is necessary to complete orders or provide requested information. The provision of all other personal information is voluntary, but may be necessary in order to use our services.

Examples of ways in which we may collect such information from you include the following:

Registration and ordering: Before ordering products through our site, you must complete a registration form and/or create an account. This will require you to provide certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, shipping and billing addresses, phone number, e-mail address, and payment information. In addition, you may also be asked to provide your country of residence so we can comply with applicable laws and regulations. These kinds of personal information are used for billing purposes, to fulfill your orders, to communicate with you about your order and this site, and for internal or third-party marketing and promotional purposes. If we encounter a problem when processing your order, we will use the personal information to contact you.

E-mail address: Some areas of the site allow you to enter your e-mail address for purposes including, but not limited to, registering for the Doctors Health Press newsletter, promotional e-mails, and e-mails from approved partners. You may unsubscribe at any time from these messages by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link contained in any promotional e-mail. (Please note that despite unsubscribing from such marketing communications, we may still contact you in relation to your order(s) or any issues relating to any business you conduct with us.) 

Additional details on the information we collect: 

1.1 We collect general types of information about you when you visit and use our web site; examples include personal information, demographic information, behavioral information, and indirect information. Sometimes we collect combinations of these types of information.

1.2 “Personal information” is information that can be used to identify you or any other individual to whom the information may relate. This is information that you are prompted to provide to us.

We may collect this same information about all other persons when you provide it to us. 

1.3 “Demographic information” is information that may or may not be unique to you in the sense that it refers to selected population characteristics. Such information may include, but is not limited to, zip code, mobile phone carrier, age, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, and personal and online interests.

1.5 “Third-party information” is information about you that we acquire from a third party that may include personal, demographic, behavioral, and indirect information. This collection may include, but is not limited to, first-party cookies, third-party cookies, anonymous cookies, persistent identifiers, e-mail opt-ins, and search engine keywords.

If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from its database.

We will use the credit card information or bank account information for purposes of processing and completing the transaction you requested. Such information will be disclosed to third parties as necessary to complete the requested purchase transaction.

**2) Collection of Information Through Web Beacons**

2.1 Generally, we, as well as third-party vendors and supporting advertisers, use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and JavaScript. These technologies collect Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. This information is used to analyze trends, administer our web site, track users’ movements through our web site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on these technologies on an individual or aggregated basis.

2.2 Third-Party Cookies. We allow third-party vendors and advertisers to set their own cookies on and through our web site. We have no control over the practices of those third parties and are not responsible for their technology or tracking. We encourage you to review the policies of such persons or entities on their web sites. We use AdWords Remarketing through Google, which is a Remarketing and Behavioral Targeting service provided by Google LLC that connects the activity on our web site with the AdWords advertising network and the DoubleClick cookie. That cookie collects information regarding certain patterns in your browsing history. To opt-out of this tracking, please see <https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en>. We also participate in all of Google Analytics Advertising. This includes (i) Remarketing with Google Analytics; (ii) Google Display Network Impression Reporting; (iii) DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration; and (iv) Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Google uses cookies to track activity performed by Google Analytics and its AdWords or DoubleClick cookie. To opt out, please see <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>. We also use Google Analytics, which is an analysis service also provided by Google LLC. Google utilizes the data collected through its cookies to track and examine the use of this site, to prepare reports on its activities, and to share them with other Google services. You may opt-out of the Google Analytics service using Google’s Opt-out Browser Add-on available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>.

2.3 Web Beacons. We use electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs, or action tags), which allow us to collect information about your visit to our web site, measure and improve the effectiveness of advertisements, and track delivery of advertising. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a cookie number, time and date of page view, as well as a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. We may also use web beacons in e-mail messages sent to you. This allows us to determine if you opened or acted upon the e-mail messages. Because web beacons are the same as any other content request, you cannot opt out of or refuse them. However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser.

**3) Security**

We employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information you provide to us. We endeavor to safeguard and protect your information. When you submit information on our web site, such information is protected both online and offline. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. The servers in which we store your information are kept in a secure physical environment. The servers have industry-standard firewalls. Access to such servers is password protected and access by our employees is limited. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer software (“SSL”) to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information including credit card number(s) and names and addresses as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although we take commercially reasonable technological precautions to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure; therefore, we cannot and do not warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through our web site is at your own risk. However, access to your information is strictly limited and not accessible to the public.

**4) How We Use Information Collected**

4.1 How We Use Your Personal Information: 

We use the personal information we collect from you for a range of different business purposes and according to different legal bases of processing. The following is a summary of how and according to which legal bases we use your personal information.

We use your personal information to fulfill a contract with you and provide you with our services, to comply with our legal obligation, to protect your vital interest, or as may be required for the public good. This includes:

  * To provide payment processing and account management; operate, measure, and improve our services; keep our services safe, secure, and operational; and customize site content that includes items and services that you may like in response to actions that you take.
  * To contact you regarding your account, to troubleshoot problems with your account or order, to resolve a dispute, to collect fees or monies owed, or as otherwise necessary to provide you with customer service.
  * When contacting you for such purposes as outlined above, we may contact you via e-mail, telephone, SMS/text messages, postal mail, and via mobile push notifications.
  * To provide other services requested by you as described when we collect the information.
  * We use general location information to provide you with location-based services (such as advertising and other personalized content).
  * To prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraud; security breaches; or other potentially prohibited or illegal activities.



We use your personal information to pursue our legitimate interests where your rights and freedoms do not outweigh these interests. We have implemented controls to balance our interests with your rights. This includes:

  * Contacting you via e-mail or postal mail in order to offer you coupons, discounts and special promotions, third-party offers, poll your opinions through surveys or questionnaires, and inform you about our services, as authorized by applicable law.
  * Delivering targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences.
  * Measuring the performance of our e-mail marketing campaigns (e.g. by analyzing open and click rates).
  * Monitoring and improving the information security of our site.



With your consent, we may use your personal information to:

  * Provide you with marketing via telephone calls, e-mail, or SMS/text messages.
  * Provide you with marketing from third parties.
  * Customize third-party advertising you might see on third-party web sites.



**You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.**

We will not make automated decisions about you that would significantly affect you, unless such a decision is necessary as part of a contract we have with you, we have your consent, or we are required by law to use such technology.

4.2 Ways You Can Access, Control, and Correct Your Personal Information:

You can see, review, and change most of your personal information by requesting it by contacting the Privacy Officer below. Please update your personal information immediately if it changes or is inaccurate. 

We will honor any statutory right you might have to access, modify, or erase your personal information. To request access and to find out whether any fees may apply, if permitted by applicable national laws, please contact us using the information below. Where you have a statutory right to request access to or request the modification or erasure of your personal information, we can still withhold that access or decline to modify or erase your personal information in some cases, in accordance with applicable national laws.

If you request that we stop processing some or all of your personal information or you withdraw (where applicable) your consent for our use or disclosure of your personal information for purposes set out in this privacy notice, we might not be able to provide you with all of the services and customer support offered and authorized under this privacy notice and our Terms of Use.

Upon your request, we will remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable national laws.

4.3 How Long We Keep Your Personal Information:

We retain personal information regarding you or your use of our services for as long as your account is subscribed to our services or for as long as needed to provide you with our services and warranties. We also retain personal information for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy—for example, to comply with our legal obligations, to protect us in the event of disputes, and to enforce our agreements and to protect our and others’ interests. 

The precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending on the nature of the information and why we need it. Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, contractual agreements, warranties, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter, whether the personal information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, the period we keep your e-mail address is connected to how long your e-mail is subscribed to our mailing list. 

After it is no longer necessary for us to retain your personal information, we will dispose of it in a secure manner, according to our data retention and deletion policies.

You may delete your personal information by contacting us at privacyofficer@doctorshealthpress.com and we will delete the personal information we hold about you (unless we need to retain it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy).

Please note that in the course of providing our services, we collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized, or de-personalized information, which we may retain indefinitely.

**Law Enforcement, Legal Proceedings, and as Authorized by Law:**

To law enforcement or governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in response to a verified request or legal process relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that exposes us, you, or any other of our users to legal liability.

To third parties involved in a legal proceeding, if they provide us with a subpoena, court order, or substantially similar legal basis, or we otherwise believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.

**Change of Ownership:**

In the unlikely event that our company or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, customer information may be one of the transferred assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information provided through the services in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

**Mail Solicitation:**

We may also provide your name, customer history, and mailing address to third parties, such as service providers, contractors, and third-party publishers and advertisers, for a variety of purposes unless you choose to opt out by mailing [customersupport@doctorshealthpress.com](mailto:customersupport@doctorshealthpress.com) stating you wish to be removed from third-party direct mailing offers, along with your name and mailing address.

We disclose your information if legally required to do so, or at our discretion, pursuant to a request from a governmental entity, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property, or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.
