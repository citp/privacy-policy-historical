     which will form part of your account data. We will also link the information you provide via


your account with your One Key ID (a unique identifier allocated to doctors), which we obtain
from Iqvia and will form part of your account data.

includes:
•     Whether you are a doctor or medical student
•     Your title
•     First name
•     Surname

•     If you are a doctor:
      o     GMC number
      o     Specialty
      o     Sub-specialty
      o     Seniority

and medical students. We will also use the name you provide for the purpose of creating a
doctors.net.uk email address for you. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate
interests, namely the proper administration of Doctors.net membership.
The data required in order to create an account (“account set up data”) includes:
•     Username
•     Password
•     Alternative email address
•     Mobile number


•     Place of birth
•     Mother’s maiden name
We will use this data for the purposes of creating an account for you, authenticating access to
your account, identifying you as the account holder, controlling and enabling you to access
areas of our website and services that are restricted to members and enabling you to reset
your password and gain access to your account if you forget your username or password.
The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely ensuring the security of
our network, IT systems and information and providing Doctors.net members with a means of
accessing our website and services.
Use of your account data for market research purposes: If you have indicated that you
want to receive invitations to participate in market research, we will use your mandatory
account data for the purposes of:
•     inviting you to take part in market research activities relevant to your specialty and
      seniority
•     monitoring and enabling your participation in market research activities via our website,
      to ensure that you can only participate in the same activity once and that any incentives
      offered for taking part in such activities are correctly credited to you
This use of your data involves an element of profiling and automated decision making, in that
we screen our members (using automated means) on the basis of their specialty and
seniority so that only members falling within the specialty and seniority criteria specified by
our clients for specific market research activities are invited to participate in those activities.
This screening process is necessary in order to ensure that our clients are able to comply
with their legal obligations under the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry
(ABPI) code to target market research activities at medical professionals for whom the market
research is relevant/suitable according to their specialty and seniority.
We may invite you to participate in relevant market research activities by email to your
doctors.net.uk email address, by using messages delivered to your homepage when you
login to your doctors.net account, or (if you have so requested) by text or telephone call.
You can opt-out of receiving these email invitations at any time and indicate whether you
would like to receive invitations via text or telephone call by changing your communications
preferences at https://www.doctors.net.uk/updateyourprofile/default.aspx.
The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely providing market
research services to our clients, and the legitimate interests of our clients in obtaining market
research data about their products or businesses in compliance with legal obligations to
which they are subject. Where incentives are offered in return for taking part, the legal basis
for our processing of your account data for the purposes of crediting you with those
incentives will be performance of a contract.


Use of your account data for marketing and communications purposes: We will use
your mandatory account data to send the following marketing and communications to your
@doctors.net.uk email address:
•    Clinical Bulletin: we will only send this to you if you have indicated that you want to
     receive them, as it contains promotional material on behalf of our clients. The content of
     the Clinical Bulletin is tailored to be relevant to your specialty and seniority and is
     targeted at you based on those criteria. Our delivery of the Clinical Bulletin to you
     therefore involves an element of profiling and automated decision making. This is
     necessary in order to ensure that our clients are able to comply with their legal
     obligations under the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) code to
     ensure that any promotional material sent to medical professionals is suitable and
     relevant according to their specialty and seniority.
•    Occasional promotional content from our clients: we will only send such emails to you
     if you have indicated that you want to receive them, as they contain promotional material
     on behalf of our clients. These emails are targeted at you based on your specialty and
     seniority. Our delivery of these emails to you therefore involves an element of profiling
     and automated decision making. This is necessary in order to ensure that our clients
     are able to comply with their legal obligations under the ABPI code to ensure that any
     promotional material sent to medical professionals is suitable and relevant according to
     their specialty and seniority.

     element of profiling and automated decision making.
•    Occasional client-specific recruitment-related emails: we will send you these unless
     you tell us that you don’t want to receive them. They do not contain any promotional
     material and enable you to be informed of job opportunities that may of interest to you.
     These emails will be targeted at you based on your specialty and seniority. Our delivery
     of the Jobs Bulletin to you therefore involves an element of profiling and automated

      candidates for jobs with them.

     Member Directory. The legal basis for this processing is that it is our legitimate interests in
     providing a networking and communications platform for our members and making your
     profile available to other members at your request.
2.4. Data collected as a result of your participation in market research activities: If you take
     part in any market research activities, we will process some of your account data as
     necessary to enable you to participate in the research. Except in the limited circumstances
     explained below, we do not disclose your account data to the client for whom we are
     conducting the research.
     We will also process the information given by you in response to the survey questions
     (“market research data”).
     We may disclose certain personal data about you to the client for whom we are conducting
     the research in the following circumstances: if your responses include any information


     pertaining to the safety of, or an adverse event connected with, a pharmaceutical product (an
     “adverse event”), we are required by law and under our contract with the client to report such
     adverse event to the client. The client will then be required by law to take certain actions in
     respect of the adverse event. This may include contacting you to obtain further information
     about the adverse event. In these circumstances we would provide your name, title and
     contact details to the client to enable them to do this. The legal basis for this disclosure is
     that it is [necessary for compliance with a legal obligation].
2.5. Publication data: If you post any content for publication on our website or through our
     services when you are logged into Doctors.net, such as forum posts and the submission of
     clinical cases and images, we will process your username and any personal data contained
     in the content you post. The publication data will be processed for the purposes of enabling
     such publication and identifying you as the source of the content. The legal basis for this

     to their products and services. We will process your enquiry data for the purposes of
     responding to your enquiry, and if you request to be contacted directly by a relevant third
     party organisation, we will pass the contact details you used to make your enquiry to the
     relevant third-party organisation for this purpose. The legal basis for this processing is our
     legitimate interests in communicating with our members and our clients’ legitimate interests in
     contacting our members where requested by an individual member.
2.7. Transaction data: We may process information relating to transactions, including purchases
     of goods and services that you enter into with us and/or through our website, such as the
     conversion of eSR (electronic Surfing Reward) points to cash to buy merchandise or
     vouchers or donate to charity. The transaction data may include your email address, name
     and home address, and the transaction details. The transaction data may be processed for
     the purpose of supplying the purchased goods and services, the legal basis for this being the
     performance of a contract between you and us. We will also keep records of those
     transactions, the legal basis for this being our legitimate interests in the proper administration
     of our business.

     •     protecting your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person

     •     the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or
           in an administrative or out-of-court procedure. (The legal basis for this processing is our

           rights and the legal rights of others.)

     unless we prompt you to do so.

3.1 We will use your relevant account data for the purposes of automated decision-making in
     relation to deciding what content you will see on the site, what content will be delivered to
     you, and which market research surveys will be offered to you. This will usually require an
     element of screening against your specialty and seniority for the purposes of delivering
     relevant and suitable content and invitations. This is described in more detail in section 2.

6.1 This Section 6 sets out our data retention policies and procedure, which are designed to help
    ensure that we comply with our legal obligations in relation to the retention and deletion of
    personal data.
6.2 Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than
    is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
6.3 We will retain and delete your personal data as follows:
     (a)    Your account data, transaction data and correspondence data will be retained for three
            years from the date on which your account has become inactive. (For the definition of
            ‘inactive’, see Terms and Conditions, section 2.7 for details) After this period, this data
            will be deleted from our systems, and we will instruct our other offices and Networks in
            Health partners to also delete this data if they hold it.
     (b)    Your usage data and market research data are anonymised, and will be retained.
     (c)      Your publication data and correspondence data will be retained, but only your
            username will be retained for reference, and all other personal details will be
            anonymised.

     where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are

7.   Security of personal data
7.1  We will take appropriate technical and organisational precautions to secure your personal
     data and to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal data.
7.2  We will store all your personal data on secure servers, personal computers and mobile
     devices, and in secure manual record-keeping systems.
7.3  All of your personal data will be stored by us in encrypted form.
7.4  Data relating to your enquiries and financial transactions that is sent from your web browser
     to our web server, or from our web server to your web browser, will be protected using
     encryption technology.
7.5  You acknowledge that the transmission of unencrypted (or inadequately encrypted) data
     over the internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent


    over the internet. GMC and BMA guidance states that doctors should not send any patient
    identifiable data across the internet. You should not post patient identifiable information on
    the website (including the forum). The email service that we provide as part of your
    membership is not encrypted, so it is especially important that you do not use it for the
    transfer of patient identifiable data. If you choose to use the Doctors.net.uk email service to
    transfer such data that you have yourself encrypted, then you do so at your own risk.
7.6 You should ensure that your password is not susceptible to being guessed, whether by a
    person or a computer program. You are responsible for keeping the password you use for
    accessing our website confidential and your password will only be used when you log in to
    our website. We will never ask you for your password.
8.  Amendments
8.1 We may update this policy from time to time by publishing a new version on our website.
8.3 We may notify you of changes to this policy by email or through the website.

    Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities
    for a full explanation of these rights.
9.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are:
    (a)    the right to access;
    (b)    the right to rectification;

    where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That
    additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of
    personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and
    freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data, after
    you supplied appropriate evidence of your identity (this will require you to log in). The first
    copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable
    fee. You can access your account data by visiting https://personal-data.doctors.net.uk/ when
    logged into the website.


9.4  You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into
     account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you
     completed. You have the ability to update and complete your account data yourself on the
     Update Your Profile page on the website.

     based processing; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data
     have been unlawfully processed. However, there are certain general exclusions of the right
     to erasure. Those general exclusions include where processing is necessary for exercising
     the right of freedom of expression and information and for compliance with a legal obligation;
     or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
9.6  In some circumstances, you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data.
     Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is
     unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of
     our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of
     legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection.
     Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal
     data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment,
     exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal
     person; or for reasons of important public interest.
9.7  You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to
     your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that
     the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or
     in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate
     interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to
     process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds
     for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for
     the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. If you object specifically to the
     processing of your account data, then fulfilment of this request will require the termination of
     your membership of Doctors.net.uk.

     purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection,

     research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation,

     However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of

     laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for

     you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the
     lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
