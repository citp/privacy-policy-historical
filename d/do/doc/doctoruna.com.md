**1\. Introduction**

DoctorUna FZ-LLC (“us,” “we” or “DoctorUna”) is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, visitors, and other users of the DoctorUna services (“Services”) provided via the DoctorUna website (collectively, "Site") . Our goal is to provide you with a secure online experience and to ensure that any information you submit to us is private and used/disclosed only for the purposes and in the means described below.

Your use of the Site is governed by this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use. If you are registering an account or using the Site on behalf of an individual or entity other than yourself, you represent that you are authorized by such individual or entity to accept this Privacy Policy on such individual's or entity's behalf.

As a doctor/dentist search site, DoctorUna will ask practitioners to submit any information relevant to the patients search in order to conduct/optimize the search functionality. All information is submitted exclusively on a voluntary basis. Please find below details of our member privacy practices.

Doctors and dentists will need to create a DoctorUna Public Profile and they fully understand that by opting to do so their profile becomes in the public domain and can be accessed by search engines. Doctors and dentists need to bear in mind that once a Public Profile gets activated, search engines and others may obtain permanent copies of it and even if the user disables their profile, DoctorUna cannot restrict views of the copies of the Public Profile obtained by these search engines and other crawlers.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you enter sensitive information on our Site, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law.

If we do, then we will notify you here, as well as by posting a notice on our Site and, where appropriate, a link to the modified policy so that you can review it. In all cases, use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
