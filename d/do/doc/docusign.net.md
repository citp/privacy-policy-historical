# Privacy Policy | DocuSign

**Effective Date:**   October 1, 2019

At DocuSign, privacy is a priority. This Privacy Policy sets out how DocuSign, Inc. and its group of companies (“us,” “our,” or “we”) collect and use information from customers and other individuals who access or use our websites, including docusign.com and docusign.net, our mobile applications, our web client or professional client, and/or any of our other sites, products, or services that link to this Privacy Policy (the “Services”). By using our Services, you understand that we will collect and use your information as described in this Privacy Policy (collectively “you”).

If you or your organization has an individual agreement with us, that agreement may have privacy terms that also apply to the information you provide to us under that agreement. Please review the terms in that agreement as they may be different or more restrictive than the terms in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites and apps that you may use, including any linked to in our Services. You should review the terms and policies for third-party websites and apps before clicking on any links.

DocuSign’s core product and Services help users create, complete, and show the validity of digital or electronic transactions, such as electronically signing a contract for mobile phone services or placing a digital signature on a loan application. As part of our Services, users want us to collect and record information that helps the parties prove the validity of the transactions. This information includes the persons who are involved in the transactions and the devices those persons use.

We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy in full to ensure you are fully informed. However, if you want to access a particular section of this Privacy Policy, please refer to the below table.

## **1\. How We Collect  Information**

To provide and improve our Services and to support advertising and marketing, we collect information about visitors to our sites, users of our Services, the devices they use, and sometimes their locations.

We collect certain information directly from you, such as when you fill out forms with a name or email address. We collect other information, usually about devices, browsers, or locations, automatically (without you typing it into a form). We may also collect information about you from other sources, such as if we purchase a list of contact information of people who may be interested in our Services.

You have choices about whether you visit our sites, install our apps, or provide information to us. However, if you do not provide us with certain information, you may not be able to use some parts of our Services. For example, if you do not adopt an electronic signature, then you will not be able to sign certain electronic documents on our Service. For choices you may have, please see Section 5 of this Privacy Policy.

**Information We Collect from You**.  You provide us with information about yourself when you:

  * Register or log in to your account
  * Start, sign, or review an electronic document
  * Create or edit your user profile
  * Contact customer support
  * Comment on our blogs or in community forums



Examples of the information you provide are: name, email address, mailing address, phone number, billing information, or electronic signature.

  * Start or participate in an electronic transaction, such as an envelope within DocuSign Signature
  * Share information in a Room
  * Add others as a member to an existing account
  * Leave comments
  * Refer friends



Your main choice for this type of information is simply not providing it, such as by not creating a profile or not leaving a comment in a blog. For other choices you may have, please see Section 5 of this Privacy Policy.  

**Information We Collect Automatically.** We automatically collect information from you and your devices when you use our Services, even when you visit our sites or apps without logging in. For choices you may have on what information we automatically collect, please see Section ­­5 of this Privacy Policy.  

The information we automatically collect includes:

  * **Device, Usage Information, and Transactional Data.** We collect information about how you use our Services and the computers or other devices, such as mobile phones or tablets, you use to access our Services. Some examples include: 
    * IP address
    * Precise geolocation information that you allow our apps to access (usually from your mobile device)
    * Unique device identifiers and device attributes, like operating system and browser type
    * Usage data, such as: web log data, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used our Services, the frequency of your use of our Services, error logs, and other similar information
    * Transactional data, such as: names and email addresses of parties to a transaction, subject line, history of actions that individuals take on a transaction(e.g. review, sign, enable features) and information about those individuals or their devices, such as name, email address, IP address, and authentication methods
  * **Cookies and Related Technologies**. We may use cookies, which are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded on your device (“Cookies”), or related technologies, such as web beacons, local shared objects and tracking pixels to store or collect information. We also allow others to use Cookies within the Services as described below. Cookies can store your preferences, your username, and help tailor advertisements. 
    * **Analytics.** We use services like Google Analytics and Mixpanel. They use Cookies to gather usage data and help us learn how people use our Services, such as the pages they visit and for how long and the website or page they were on before coming to a DocuSign website. 
    * **Tailored Advertising.  **
      * **Ads for Other Products & Services**. Third parties whose products or services are marketed on our Services may place or read from Cookies on your computer or other device to collect information. They do this to (i) tailor and serve advertising based on information like past visits to our Services and other sites; and (ii) report the number of ads served and the responses to those ads;
      * **Ads for our Products and Services**. We may also use services, like Google, AdRoll, and Appnexus, to serve tailored ads about our products and Services to you on our Services and elsewhere. We allow these third parties to use and access their own cookies on your computer or other device(s) you use to access our Services. We do not have access to these cookies or related technologies, and this Privacy Policy does not govern the use of those cookies and related technologies.



For choices you have on Cookies and related technologies, please see Section 5 of this Policy. For additional information about cookies and related technologies, please go to our [Cookies Notice](https://www.docusign.com/company/cookie-policy) (<https://www.docusign.com/company/cookie-policy>).

**Information We Collect from Other Sources.** We may collect information about you from others, such as: 

  * **Third-Party Sources.** Examples of third-party sources include marketers, partners, researchers, affiliates (like companies connected to DocuSign), service providers, and others where they are legally allowed to share your information with us. For example, if you register for our Services on another website, the website may provide your information to us.
  * **Other Customers.** Other customers may give us your information. For example, if a customer wants you to sign an electronic document in our Services, he or she will give us your email address and name.
  * **Combining Information from Different Sources.** We may combine the information we receive from other sources with information we collect from you (or your device) and use it as described in this Privacy Policy.



**Information We Collect & Process on Behalf of Customers**. When our customers use our Services, we process and store certain information on their behalf as a data processor. For example, in DocuSign Signature when a customer (or the customer’s Authorized Users) uploads contracts or other documents for review or signature, we act as a data processor and process the documents on the customer's behalf and in accordance with their instructions. In those instances, the customer is the data controller and is responsible for most aspects of the processing of the information. If you have any questions or concerns about how information is processed in these cases, including how to exercise your rights as a data subject, we recommend contacting the customer.

## **2\. Use of Information**

In general, we collect, use, store, and process your information to provide our Services, to fix and improve them, to develop new Services, and to market our companies and their products and Services. Here are some examples of how we use the information we process:

  * Provide you with the Services and products you request and collect payments
  * Send you records of our relationship, including for purchases or other events
  * Market features, products, or special events using email or phone or send you marketing communications about third party products and services we think may be of interest to you
  * Record details about what happens with electronic documents, such as who viewed or signed, the devices used and when these events occur
  * Run sweepstakes, contests, and refer-a-friend programs
  * Choose and deliver content and tailored advertising
  * Create and review data about our users and how they use our Services
  * Test changes in our Services and develop new features and products

  * Prevent, investigate and respond to: fraud, unauthorized access to or use of our Services, breaches of terms and policies, or other wrongful behavior
  * Comply with legal obligations
  * Meet legal retention periods



**Other Uses.** We may combine the information we collect (“aggregate”) or remove pieces of information (“de-identify”) to limit or prevent identification of any particular user or device to help with goals like research and marketing. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our use of such aggregated or de-identified information.

**Lawful Basis for Processing Your Information**. If European data protection law applies and DocuSign acts as a controller, our lawful basis for collecting and using the information described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the information concerned and the specific context in which we collect or use it.

We normally collect or use information from you or others only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect or retain personal information or may need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. For example, when we:

  * Use information to create and manage an account, we need it in order to provide relevant Services.
  * Gather and record data associated with use of a digital certificate or digital signature, it is to comply with regulations.
  * Use names and email addresses for email marketing purposes, we do so with your consent (which you can withdraw at any time).
  * Gather usage data and analyze it to improve our Services, we do so based on our legitimate interest in safeguarding and improving our Services.



If you have questions about or need further information concerning the lawful basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided in Section ­­10 of this Privacy Policy.

## **3\. Information Sharing**

## **4\. Retention of Information**

We keep your personal information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.
