We also share Personal Information and Traffic Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Services. Those business partners have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to DR.Oogle. Last, we may transfer information about you if DR.Oogle is acquired by or merged with another company.

Finally, we may share or release information in the circumstances described below under “Expectations of Privacy”.

A "cookie" is an element of data that a website, when visited by a user, sends to that user's browser which, in turn, may store that element on the user's hard drive or memory. We use "cookies" to customize your experience of our Services, to improve the security of the Services, to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Services, and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

However, by disabling cookies, you may not have access to the entire set of features of the Services.

We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. Presently, the only third-party analytics service provider we use is Google Analytics. For Google’s privacy practices see [ this. ](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html) To opt out of data recording and analysis by Google Analytics, see [ this. ](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

_Do Not Track_

We use only cookies as described above. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information or track users’ online activities over time and across different web sites. For information regarding Do Not Track mechanisms, see <http://allaboutdnt.com/>. 

**Expectations of Privacy**

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless we believe in good faith that disclosure of your Personal Information or any other information we collect about you is appropriate to: (a) comply with the law, or a law enforcement agency request, subpoena, court order or other such request by a legal authority; (b) protect the rights, property or personal safety of DR.Oogle or anyone else; (c) enforce our Terms and policies, to otherwise establish or exercise our rights, or defend against legal claims; (d) investigate, prevent and take action regarding fraud or misuse of the Service or (d) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates the rights of third parties. 

_Providers_

**Providers, their employees, and their agents should be particularly aware of their obligations of patient confidentiality, including without limitation their obligations under HIPAA, both in communicating with DR.Oogle or other Users, posting User Content and in responding to postings and comments.** **DR.Oogle does not have and will not accept any obligations of confidentiality with respect to any communications other than those expressly stated in this Privacy Policy and the DR.Oogle Terms of Service.**

_Public Information_

**Any information that you may reveal in a posting or other online discussion or forum is intentionally open to the public and is not in any way confidential or private. You should think carefully before disclosing any personally identifiable information in any public forum. What you have written may be seen and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict.**

**Reasonable Efforts**

Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you should guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Personal Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information), as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law. 

We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and to take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our Privacy Policy. We sometimes release beta versions of our products and services, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because these products and services are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy concerns. In light of the above and because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, and the security risks associated with using the Internet, we do not guarantee error-free performance under this Privacy Policy. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LAW, SMILINGDOCS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RELATING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. 

**Inquiries**

Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personally identifiable information. To request this information please contact us at the address at the end of this Privacy Policy. If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire to use the Services, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove, or deactivate it by contacting us at the addresses at the end of this Privacy Policy. Before we process any request, we may request personal information to verify your identity where allowed by law. Where permitted by local law, we may reject requests that are unreasonable or impractical. We will respond to your request within a reasonable time frame. 

**International Transfer**

Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your personally identifiable information to us, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to the United States and process it there. 

**Updates and Changes**

We reserve the right, at any time and without advance notice, to add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such change, update, or modification on the Services and without any other notice to you. If you have established an Account for the Services, we will attempt to inform you of any modifications to this Privacy Policy that affect your obligations to us or our obligations to you: (a) by a message displayed at the time you log into the Services, and / or (b) by such other means as we deem reasonably likely to reach you. If you do not agree with any such modifications, the sole remedy is the termination of your Account. Your continued use of the Services after receiving notice of any modifications indicates your acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy. 

If you have not established an account for the Services, any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting of the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Services, and your continued use of the Services after any modifications indicates acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy. You agree to review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications.
