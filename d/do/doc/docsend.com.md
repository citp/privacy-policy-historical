DocSend provides a web-based and mobile service (the “ **Service** ”) designed to assist users who have DocSend accounts (“ **Users** ”) with sharing their information, content, materials, files, and folders (together, their “ **Content** ”) and analyzing how their Content is viewed and/or received by their customers, prospective customers, and other third parties that are not registered Users of the Service (“ **Viewers** ”).

Users can access the Service through our website located at [https://docsend.com](https://docsend.com/) (“ **Site** ”), applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “ **Device** ” is any computer used to access the DocSend Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.

#### Scope

This Privacy Policy governs your access of the DocSend Service, regardless of how you access it, and explains what data we collect when you use the Site and/or the Service, why we collect the data, how it is used, and your rights and choices. This policy applies to personal data and other information collected by us from or about: (i) visitors to, or users of, our Site, (ii) prospective clients, (iii) current clients, (iv) job applicants.

While providing our Service, we collect information related to Viewers on behalf of our Users. Our use of information on behalf of our Users is governed by our contract with the applicable User and the User’s own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or privacy practices of Users or other third parties.

DocSend complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks (“ **Frameworks** ”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the processing of personal data transferred from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. (for these purposes, reference to the EU also includes the European Economic Area countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). DocSend has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (described below). If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the EU or Swiss Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Frameworks and to view our certification page, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

By using our Site or the Service you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.

#### 1\. Information We Collect

When you interact with the Site or the Service and in connection with our events, and sales and marketing activities, we collect information that alone or in combination with other information could be used to identify you (“ **Personal Data** ”), as described below:

**_A. Information You Provide as a User_**  
When you register an account as a User, you may be asked to provide Personal Data including without limitation, your name, phone number, email address, home address or business address.

You may also choose to submit Personal Data to us when you send us an email or use any interactive features that we may make available on the Service. For example, you may ask us to: (a) import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (such as your email account) or (b) use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services.

You may also provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing folders or files with them or if you invite them to join DocSend.

We may also collect data from you including without limitation when you attend one of our events, during phone calls with sales representatives, or when you contact customer support.

**_D. Information We Receive from Viewers_**  
If you are a Viewer, a User may request that you provide them with information (including Personal Data) via the Service in order to view that User’s Content. In particular, in order to access Content that a User wants to share with Viewers, a Viewer may be asked to provide his or her email address upon opening a DocSend User’s link (or Viewers’ email address may be provided by the User). DocSend stores this information on behalf of our Users. In the event you as a Viewer provide a User with this information, you do so in accordance with that User’s privacy practices and policies.

In providing the Service, we process on behalf of Users information included in the Content that Users (and as appropriate Users’ representatives, employees or other data subjects as elected by Users) upload, download, or access with, share, or send through the Service (“ **Content** ”). If you add Content to your account that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous Content with your account rather than storing a duplicate.

**_F. Information We Receive from Third Parties_**  
We may also receive Personal Data (such as your email address) through other Users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to refer DocSend to you.

#### 3\. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We will display your Personal Data on your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account. You may access and change these preferences at any time as described in Section 4. Any Personal Data you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you.

When Viewers receive Content from Users, we show a User’s name to the relevant Viewer. We also give our Users the ability to provide their contact information within the document viewer to the relevant Viewers. We show a Viewer’s email address and name to the User who sent the Content through our Service, if the Viewer has provided his or her email address.

We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your account (see below). Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your information public. Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated. Please consider carefully what Personal Data you disclose in your profile page and our Service, and your desired level of anonymity.

**_B. Employees, Service Providers, Business Partners, and Others_**  
We will disclose your Personal Data to our employees as necessary to deliver the Service, and we may use certain third party companies and individuals to help us provide, support, analyze, and improve the Service (such as providers of data storage services, maintenance services, payment processing (described below), database management, providers of analytics services who help us understand how you use and interact with the Site and the Service, providers of digital advertising services, providers of CRM, marketing, and sales software solutions, vendors who assist with recruiting, talent and background checking). These third parties may have access to your Personal Data for the purpose of performing these tasks on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions, under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.

**_D. Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of DocSend’s Rights_**  
We may disclose to parties outside DocSend files stored in your DocSend account and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation, or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of DocSend or its users; or (d) to protect DocSend’s property rights.
