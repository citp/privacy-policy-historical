One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page.

When you return to the same DoorDash website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the DoorDash features that you customized.
