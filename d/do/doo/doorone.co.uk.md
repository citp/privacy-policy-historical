# eBay Commerce Network UK - Privacy Policy

#### eBay Commerce Network Privacy Policy

### Your Privacy Rights

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes your privacy rights regarding our collection, use, storage, sharing, and protection of your personal information.  It governs your participation on the eBayCommerce.com, Shopping.com, Epinions.com, DealTime.com, and PriceTool.com websites (including the versions of these sites in foreign jurisdictions), their sister sites, and all co-branded versions of these sites or any successor brand that eBay may designate from time to time in its discretion (in the United States or foreign jurisdictions), which are referred to collectively as the “eBay Commerce Network” or “ECN,” along with their related sites, applications, services, and tools, regardless of how you access or use them, including through mobile devices.

You accept this Privacy Policy when you sign up for, access, or use our products, services, content, features, technologies, or functions offered on our websites and all related sites, applications, and services (collectively “eBay Commerce Network Services”).

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site.  Any such amendment shall take effect when such amendment is sent by email or posted on the eBay Commerce Network.  Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that person.  We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person.

  * information provided in the context of community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our sites, or correspondence sent to us

### Communication Preferences and Marketing (Opt-out)

### Use and Disclosure

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with secure and smooth access to the ECN websites and/or use of our services, applications, and tools, to provide you with requested customer service and relevant information about your account and our services, and to provide you with a safe, efficient, and customized experience. You agree that we may use your personal information to:

  * provide other services requested by you, as described at the time when we collect the information from you, or to contact you for other purposes authorized by law.



We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. Such information will be disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws and regulations. As stated above, we do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.

We may also share your personal information with:

  * [Members of the eBay Inc. corporate family](http://www.ebayprivacycenter.com/about-us/corporate-family) to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions, and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts, violations of our policies, fraud and/or data security breaches, and to guide decisions about their products, sites, applications, services and tools, and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have requested their services and will use your personal information in compliance with their Privacy Policy and our global privacy standards.
  * Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as, but not limited to, fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, site operations, and co-branded credit cards).
  * Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service). On the eBay Commerce Network, you may have opportunities to express interest in or register for third-party products and services. If you do, we will provide information about you to the third party to implement your request;
  * Law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other eBay Commerce Network user to legal liability. In such events, we will only disclose information relevant and necessary to the investigation or inquiry, such as name, city, state, ZIP code, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, and anything else we may deem relevant to the investigation;
  * Credit bureaus with which we may report information about your account, including information on late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report;
  * Other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information would be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice); and/or
  * For our internal development and market research, we may collect survey information from you and share the results with our affiliates, consultants, vendors and service providers as applicable and authorized by this Privacy Policy.



Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties only if such parties have a subpoena, court order, or substantially similar legal procedure, or if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.

### Information You Share on Site

Some portions of the eBay Commerce Network allow you to contribute ratings, reviews, tags, comments, and other content, either on one of our websites or via our product review services on other websites. This content may be displayed publicly on the eBay Commerce Network and elsewhere on the web. The reviews and comments you publish may be displayed with your member or user name. Registered members can publish reviews by logging in to their accounts; reviews submitted through our product review services cannot be deleted once uploaded. For some of our features, other members may be able to request email notifications of your new public content or publish their own comments to your reviews. You can also choose to make your wish lists private, but they are public by default. 

We may use the public content to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views, market products or identify or feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular or highest-earning reviews and members. While we do not expect to transfer the complete review rating and web of trust database to others (except as discussed in this policy), we use the database throughout our network and to generate results for others.

Your ECN User ID is displayed throughout the eBay Commerce Network (and so it is available to the public), and is connected to all of your ECN activity. This means that other people can see the feedback, ratings, and comments associated with your User ID. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites likewise refer to specific User IDs. Therefore, if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your ECN activities. 

If you access our sites from a shared computer or a computer in an internet café, you must log out of your account after use, or else certain information about you such as your User ID, activity, or reminders from eBay may be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you.

### Cookies

When you access our websites or use our applications, services, or tools, we may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, "Flash cookies," or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications ("Cookies"). We use these data files to help us identify you as a user, customize our services, content and advertising, to measure promotional effectiveness, and to promote trust and safety. For more detailed information on our use of Cookies, see , see [Cookies and Your Privacy](http://pages.ebay.com/help/account/cookies-web-beacons.html). 

A few important things you should know about our use of Cookies: 

  * We offer certain features that are available only through the use of Cookies
  * We use both session and persistent Cookies. Session Cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Persistent Cookies remain on your device until you erase them or they expire
  * You are always free to decline Cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of our websites, applications, and/or services and tools. Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling Cookies
  * We encode and protect our Cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them
  * You may encounter Cookies from third parties, known as service providers, that we have allowed on our site that assist us with various aspects of our web site operations and services
  * You also may encounter Cookies from third parties on certain pages of the websites that we do not control and have not authorized. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page)



### Spam, Spyware, or Spoofing

eBay Inc. does not tolerate spam on the eBay Commerce Network. We do not send emails to anyone without permission, and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any unauthorized third party. This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. If you believe that you have received an unsolicited email from us, please contact our Privacy Department as directed below and we will investigate.

### Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Personal Information

Registered members can review and change personal information at any time by accessing the member page on their country version of Shopping.com (the [United States](http://www.shopping.com/), the [United Kingdom](http://uk.shopping.com/), [France](http://fr.shopping.com/), [Germany](http://de.shopping.com/) and [Australia](http://au.shopping.com/) ) or [Epinions](http://www.epinions.com/myaccount.html). You should promptly update your personal information if it changes or becomes inaccurate. You can make your ECN wish lists private by clicking “MyLists” and indicating that you want to keep your lists private. You can close your Shopping.com account by contacting Customer Support for the following country versions of Shopping.com through the following links: the [United States](http://www.shopping.com/sc/contact-us), the [United Kingdom](http://uk.shopping.com/sc/contact-us), [France](http://fr.shopping.com/sc/contact-us), [Germany](http://de.shopping.com/sc/contact-us) and [Australia](http://au.shopping.com/sc/contact-us), or your Epinions account by clicking [here](http://www.epinions.com/help/feedback_general.html). We may retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce our User Agreement, or take other actions permitted by law.  Likewise if your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we may maintain some information to prevent re-registration.

### Protection and Retention

We store and process your information on our servers located in the United States and around the world. We maintain appropriate technical, physical, and administrative security measures to protect the security of your personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or alteration. We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate and up to date, and delete any information that is no longer useful or relevant to our operations. 

### Third Parties

Our ECN websites may contain links to other third party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other websites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site's own privacy policy.

### Co-Brand Services

You'll sometimes see eBay Commerce Network content on other websites, labeled "Powered by eBay Commerce Network." For example, we syndicate our eBay Commerce Network listings for use on other companies' websites. These listings appear with another company's logo at the top of the page. When you browse these syndicated listings, you are subject to that company's privacy policy, and eBay Inc. does not collect any personal information about you or receive any personal information from these other companies. The privacy practices of our corporate family are consistent with those described in this Privacy Policy and our BCRs.

You may also interact with our product review services on websites operated by other companies. When you submit reviews or other content using our product review services, the information we collect is subject to our policies. We clearly label our product review services with the ECN Privacy Policy and User Agreement.
