# Shopping.com UK - Find, Compare, and Buy Anything in Seconds

September 13th, 2010 

On September 13th, 2010, the Privacy Policy for shopping.com was updated. Please take a few minutes and review the revised policy. If you have any questions, please contact [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/sc/contact-us).

### Your Privacy

The websites in the Shopping.com Network - Shopping.com, Epinions.com, DealTime.com and PriceTool.com - are brought to you by Shopping.com, Inc., an eBay company. This Privacy Policy tells you how Shopping.com collects, uses and protects your information on the Shopping.com Network and in other locations online where you interact with Shopping.com content or services.

By using the Shopping.com Network, you agree to the terms and conditions of the User Agreement, including this Privacy Policy, and you consent to Shopping.com's privacy practices. This includes the use and disclosure of any personal information you have shared with us and its transfer to and storage on our servers in the United States and elsewhere in the world where we have facilities.

Binding Corporate Rules

In addition to the privacy practices set out in this Privacy Policy, eBay Inc., the parent of shopping.com, has established a set of Corporate Rules (also referred to as Binding Corporate Rules), approved by a number of European Union privacy regulators. These Corporate Rules are a commitment by eBay Inc. to adequately protect your personal information regardless of where the data resides, and depending upon your location, may provide additional privacy rights through your privacy regulator or a court. If you would like additional information regarding the Corporate Rules contact us via the contact details below.

### Collection

You can browse the Shopping.com Network without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Certain features and services on the Shopping.com Network require that you register or supply some information that allows us to identify you. We collect some information automatically from your computer while you browse our sites, such as where you go on the Shopping.com Network and what you do there. We collect your IP address, computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform, the URLs you come from and go to next, and a cookie number.

When you register on one of the sites in the Shopping.com Network, we collect and store your e-mail address and a password. When you participate in some of the Shopping.com Network services, you may also choose to provide the following personal information:  


  * Profile information, including first and last name, member or user name and location
  * Contact information, including email address, mailing address and phone number 
  * Product information, including the ratings, reviews, tags, comments and other content you post, and the items in your wish lists 
  * Other information that allows us to personalize your Shopping.com Network experience - for example, your filter and profile preferences



We may get additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, you might contact Community Care or customer support or respond to a survey, or we might get a third-party complaint about you.  


**Co-Branded Services.** You'll sometimes see Shopping.com content on other websites, labeled "Powered by Shopping.com." For example, we syndicate our Shopping.com listings for use on other companies' websites. These listings appear with another company's logo at the top of the page. When you browse these syndicated listings, you are subject to that company's privacy policy, and Shopping.com does not collect any personal information about you or receive any personal information from these other companies.

You may also interact with our product review services on websites operated by other companies. When you submit reviews or other content using our product review services, the information we collect is subject to our policies. We clearly label our product review services with the Shopping.com Privacy Policy and User Agreement.  


### Marketing

We don't sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our services, content and advertising. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicate your preference in your shopping.com account or by following the directions provided with the communication or advertisement.

### Use

We use the information we collect to:   


  * operate the Shopping.com Network
  * provide you with information and services you request 
  * customize content, advertising, and your experience on the Shopping.com Network
  * communicate with you about your orders, service updates and other administrative issues 
  * deliver to our members targeted marketing and promotional offers, based on their communications preferences
  * measure and improve our sites and services 
  * resolve disputes, address complaints and troubleshoot technical problems 
  * analyze site and user behavior and prepare aggregated reports 
  * tell you about our services and those of our corporate family



### Sharing and Disclosure

**Other eBay Companies.** We may share information with members of the eBay Inc. corporate family-like eBay or PayPal -to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you've requested their services.

**Service Providers.** We may share your information with service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as maintaining the Shopping.com Network and providing related services).

**Special Offers.** On the Shopping.com Network, you may have opportunities to express interest in or register for third-party products and services. If you do, we will provide information about you to the third party to implement your request.

**Feedback.** We may use survey results for our internal development and market research and share the results with our affiliates, consultants, vendors and service providers.

**Assets.** As our business evolves, Shopping.com may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such an event, personal information may be one of the assets transferred.

**Other Disclosures.** We may disclose information when permitted by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary under applicable law; to comply with legal process served on Shopping.com; to protect the property or interests of Shopping.com, its agents and employees; or to protect personal safety or the public.

### Public Content

Some portions of the Shopping.com Network allow you to contribute ratings, reviews, tags, comments, and other content, either on one of our websites or via our product review services on other websites. This content may be displayed publicly on the Shopping.com Network and elsewhere on the web. The reviews and comments you publish may be displayed with your member or user name. Registered members can unpublish reviews by logging in to their accounts; reviews submitted through our product review services may not be unpublished. For some of our features, other members may be able to request email notifications of your new public content or publish their own comments to your reviews. You can also choose to make your wish lists public, but they are private by default.

We may use the public content to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views, market products or identify or feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular or highest-earning reviews and members. While we don't expect to transfer the complete review rating and web of trust database to others (except as discussed in this policy), we use the database throughout our network and to generate results for others.

### E-mail Communications

**Choice/Opt-Out.** At any time, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications (including customized ads) from the Shopping.com Network, but you may not opt out of administrative emails (for example, emails about your transactions or policy changes) while you are a member of the Shopping.com Network. You can opt out by either changing your preferences or following the directions provided with the communications or advertisements.

**Email Tools.** If you send emails to a recipient through our site, they will receive your email address and any personal message you include. Although we do not retain in any easily retrievable way the addresses you email, these emails are not private communications. You may not use our email tools to send spam or content that violates the User Agreement.

**Anti-Spam Policy.** Shopping.com does not tolerate spam. We do not send emails to anyone without permission, and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any unauthorized third party. This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. If you believe that you have received an unsolicited email from us, please contact our [Privacy Department](https://web.archive.org/sc/contact-us) and we will investigate.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

**Shopping.com's Cookies.** Shopping.com, other members of our corporate family who provide us with joint services, and our service providers will sometimes place anonymous cookies or web beacons on your computer when you visit our sites or our co-branded sites. We use these cookies and web beacons to recognize returning users, measure traffic and activity on the sites, monitor and improve our services and protect against fraud. We also use cookies to customize services, content, advertising, and promotional offers.

You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you. Your browser must be set to accept cookies in order to access the Shopping.com Network as a registered member.

**Our Advertisers's Cookies.** We use the services of third-party advertising companies, who may place cookies that allow them to collect from you and use anonymous information about your visits to the Shopping.com Network. For more about their practices and your options regarding their information collection and use, click here. 

### Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information

Registered members can review and change personal information by accessing the Member page on Shopping.com or [Epinions](http://www.epinions.com/myaccount.html). You should promptly update your personal information if it changes or becomes inaccurate. You can close your Shopping.com account by contacting [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/sc/contact-us) or your Epinions account by clicking [here](http://www.epinions.com/help/faq/?show=faq_changing#006). We may retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce our User Agreement and take other actions otherwise permitted by law. If your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we may maintain some information to prevent re-registration.

### Links to Other Sites

The Shopping.com Network contains links to other websites. Shopping.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other websites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site's own privacy policy.

### Security

Shopping.com uses physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, including advanced firewall and password protection for our databases, designed to protect the security of information. We restrict access to your personal information to employees that need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

### General

We may change this policy from time to time, and we will post the amended terms on the Shopping.com Network. All amended terms will take effect immediately for new users, and 30 days after they are posted for existing users.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the practices of the Shopping.com Network, you may e-mail our [Privacy Department](https://web.archive.org/sc/contact-us) or contact:

### Cookies, web beacons, and your privacy

We use cookies, web beacons, and related tools from third parties to provide features and services that improve your buying and selling experience. To help protect your privacy, we limit how these tools can be used on shopping.com.

### How shopping.com uses cookies and web beacons

"Cookies" are small files placed on the hard drive of your computer. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive once you sign out from shopping.com or close your web browser.

We use cookies to provide features and services, such as:

  * Allowing you to enter your password less frequently
  * Remembering your preferences

  * Measuring the effectiveness of our sites, services, content, and advertising
  * Facilitating conversation threads and other services on discussion boards (these cookies are placed by our board service providers)

### Use of cookies and web beacons by third parties

We may work with other companies who place cookies or web beacons on our websites. These companies help operate our websites and provide you with additional products and services. They are subject to confidentiality agreements with shopping.com and other legal restrictions. shopping.com does not permit any of these companies to collect personal information using cookies or web beacons on our websites.

DoubleClick is our service provider who may use cookies to help us deliver our own content and compile anonymous site metrics and analytics. We require these companies to use the information they collect only to provide us with these services under contract.

We participate in cookie-based ad networks and exchanges operated by Fetch Back and Revenue Science. Although these companies use some anonymous information about you to display ads, we don't permit these companies to collect any personal information about you.

## Datenschutzerkl�rung

Stand: March 2011

Diese Datenschutzerkl�rung wurde zuletzt am 11.03.2011 aktualisiert. Bitte nehmen Sie sich ein paar Minuten Zeit, um die ver�nderten Bestimmungen zu lesen. Falls Sie irgendwelche Fragen haben, oder mit den Ver�nderungen nicht einverstanden sind, kontaktieren Sie bitte den Kundenservice.

Die deutschsprachigen Websites [www.de.shopping.com](http://www.de.shopping.com/) geh�ren und werden betrieben von der Shopping Epinions International Limited (nachfolgend Shopping.com), ein zur eBay-Gruppe geh�rendes Unternehmen. Der Zweck dieser Datenschutzerkl�rung ist es Ihnen zu erkl�ren, wie wir und andere Mitglieder der eBay-Gruppe Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nutzen und, soweit erforderlich, Ihre Zustimmung f�r bestimmte Nutzungen einzuholen.

Shopping.com erhebt, verarbeitet und nutzt Ihre Daten gem�� den geltenden datenschutzrechtlichen Bestimmungen. Verantwortliche Stelle f�r die Einhaltung der datenschutzrechtlichen Bestimmungen bei der Erhebung, Verarbeitung und Nutzung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten ist die Shopping Epinions International Limited. Der Firmensitz von Shopping Epinions International Limited ist Irland. Nach � 1 Abs. 5 Bundesdatenschutzgesetz richtet sich daher der Umgang mit Ihren personenbezogenen Daten nach irischem Datenschutzrecht. 

Shopping.com ist �berzeugt, dass Vertrauen eine Grundvoraussetzung f�r die Serviceleistungen ist, die wir unseren Kunden bieten. Damit wir Ihr Vertrauen auf Dauer verdienen, bem�hen wir von Shopping.com uns nach Kr�ften um den Schutz Ihrer Daten und die Vertraulichkeit Ihrer pers�nlichen Angaben. 

Diese Datenschutzbestimmungen sind Bestandteil der [Allgemeinen Nutzungsbedingungen](https://web.archive.org/sc/terms-of-service) von Shopping.com. Durch Nutzung der Website erkl�ren Sie sich mit den Allgemeinen Nutzungsbedingungen, einschlie�lich dieser Datenschutzbestimmungen, einverstanden. **Gleichzeitig stimmen Sie durch Ihre Nutzung der Website unserer Handhabung personenbezogenener Daten zu, wie sie in dieser Datenschutzerkl�rung beschrieben ist, darunter auch der Nutzung und Weitergabe von personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie uns �berlassen haben.**

### Verbindliche Unternehmensregeln (Binding Corporate Rules)

Neben den in dieser Datenschutzerkl�rung genannten Datenschutzgrunds�tzen hat eBay Inc., die Muttergesellschaft von Shopping.com, f�r die eBay-Unternehmensgruppe Unternehmensregeln (sogenannte [Binding Corporate Rules](http://pages.ebay.de/help/policies/binding-corporate-rules.html)) aufgestellt, die von einer Reihe von Datenschutzbeh�rden in der Europ�ischen Union anerkannt wurden. Mit diesen Unternehmensregeln verpflichtet sich eBay Inc., Ihre personenbezogenen Daten unabh�ngig von deren Speicherort angemessen zu sch�tzen. Abh�ngig von Ihrem Sitz oder Wohnsitz k�nnen sich aus diesen Unternehmensregeln �ber Ihre zust�ndige Aufsichtsbeh�rde oder ein Gericht weitere Datenschutzrechte ergeben. Wenn Sie mehr zu unseren Unternehmensregeln wissen oder uns kontaktieren m�chten, finden Sie unten die entsprechenden Kontaktinformationen. 

### Minderjährige

Die Website ist weder auf Minderjährige oder Personen die nicht unbeschränkt geschäftsfähig sind zugeschnitten noch für deren Nutzung gedacht. Mit Ihrer Nutzung der Website erklären Sie, dass Sie volljährig und unbeschränkt geschäftsfähig sind. Wir behalten uns vor, den Zugriff auf die Website zu beenden, wenn Shopping.com davon Kenntnis erlangt, dass Sie minderjährig oder nicht voll geschäftsfähig sind. Minderjährige sollen uns keine Daten überlassen, die Rückschlüsse auf ihre Person zulassen; sollten wir daher feststellen, dass wir versehentlich solche Daten erfasst haben, unternehmen wir geeignete Schritte zu deren Löschung. 

### Welche Daten erfassen wir?

**Daten, die Sie uns überlassen.** Voraussetzung für die Nutzung bestimmter Funktionen und Serviceleistungen auf der Website ist möglicherweise, dass Sie sich registrieren lassen und persönliche Angaben machen, zum Beispiel Ihren Namen, E-Mail-Adresse, Telefonnummer und andere Angaben, die von Shopping.com gespeichert werden. Wir können auch weitere Angaben von Ihnen erfassen, um Ihnen konkret auf Sie zugeschnittene Serviceleistungen anbieten und Ihre Besuche auf unserer Website nach Ihren persönlichen Bedürfnissen und Vorlieben gestalten zu können. 

### Daten, die automatisch erfasst werden.

Unsere Website arbeitet mit “Cookies” zur automatischen Erkennung von Nutzern, die unsere Website wiederholt nutzen. Ein Cookie ist eine Mini-Datei auf Ihrer Festplatte, die uns erlaubt, Ihre in der Vergangenheit festgelegten Suchkriterien anzuzeigen und Ihnen bei Ihren Besuchen auf unseren Website Hinweise zu geben, die Sie interessieren dürften. “Clear gifs” sind kleine Grafiken mit eindeutiger Kennzeichnung. Sie funktionieren ähnlich wie Cookies und helfen uns, die Online-Bewegungen von Webnutzern zu verfolgen oder festzustellen, ob Sie eine E-Mail-Nachricht, die Sie von erhalten haben, bereits geöffnet haben.

Ihr Internet-Service-Provider weist Ihrem Computer, wenn Sie das Internet nutzen, eine IP-Adresse zu. Wir erfassen alle IP-Adressen, die auf unsere Website zugreifen. Außerdem erfassen wir Angaben zu Rechner und Verbindung, zum Beispiel Browser-Typ und Version, Betriebssystem und Plattform, Ihr Verhalten auf der Website und Ihre Reaktion auf dort angebotene Serviceleistungen, zum Beispiel die Produkte und Anbieter, die Sie betrachten oder suchen, sowie die URL, von der Sie kommen und die Sie als nächstes aufsuchen, Cookie-Nummer, Anbieter und Hersteller, die Sie besuchen, und Artikel, die Sie kaufen. Wir nutzen diese und andere Daten in unseren Datenbanken, um Website und Nutzerverhalten analysieren, technische Probleme beseitigen, Streitigkeiten und Reklamationen lösen und zusammenfassende Berichte erstellen zu können, die wir an Dritte weitergeben und nutzen, um künftige Besuche auf unserer Website individuell anzupassen. 

Wenn Sie die Einstellungen auf Ihrem Browser verändern, können Sie Cookies blockieren (Ihr Internet-Service-Provider hilft Ihnen da sicher weiter), doch laufen Sie dabei Gefahr, bestimmte Serviceleistungen einzubüßen (z. B. können Suchergebnisse dann nicht gespeichert werden). Wenn Sie als registriertes Mitglied auf die Website zugreifen möchten, muss Ihr Browser so eingestellt sein, dass er Cookies akzeptiert. 

Wir arbeiten mit unabhängigen Werbetreibenden zusammen, die Cookies platzieren k�nnen, die es ihnen erlauben, anonyme Daten �ber Ihre Besuche auf Shopping.com zu sammeln und zu nutzen. Falls Sie mehr �ber das Vorgehen der Werbetreibenden, sowie �ber Ihre Optionen bez�glich der Datensammlung und -nutzung erfahren m�chten, klicken Sie [hier](https://web.archive.org/sc/advcookies-de)

**Andere Datenerfassung.** Möglicherweise erhalten wir noch auf anderen Wegen, die in diesen Richtlinien nicht konkret beschrieben sind, Daten von Ihnen oder über Sie. Das ist beispielsweise der Fall, wenn Sie sich an den Customer Support, d. h. unsere Kundenbetreuung, wenden oder wenn eine Beschwerde über Sie eingeht. 

### Verwendung von Daten durch Shopping.com

Daten, die Sie uns �ber die Website �berlassen, nutzt Shopping.com zum Betrieb der Website; zudem helfen uns diese Daten, Ihnen die gew�nschten Informationen und Serviceleistungen zu bieten und mit Ihnen zu kommunizieren. Wir k�nnen Ihre Daten beispielsweise dazu verwenden, Ihnen gezielt Werbeanzeigen zu pr�sentieren, die Sie interessieren k�nnten, oder Ihnen E-Mails zu senden, etwa Newsletters und Warnhinweise. Mithilfe Ihrer Daten k�nnen wir Sie auch kontaktieren, wenn es notwendig ist (um Ihnen beispielsweise bei der Nutzung der Website behilflich zu sein). Nat�rlich steht Ihnen die Entscheidung frei, uns diese Daten nicht zukommen zu lassen. Damit sind allerdings unsere M�glichkeiten beeintr�chtigt, Ihnen ma�geschneiderte Serviceleistungen zu bieten. Sie k�nnen uns jederzeit mitteilen, dass Sie k�nftig keine Zusendungen oder personalisierte Werbung mehr w�nschen (siehe den Abschnitt "Ihre Entscheidung/Verzicht auf E-Mail-Nachrichten oder personalisierte Werbung von Shopping.com" unten). E-Mails, die wir Ihnen aus verwaltungstechnischen Gr�nden zusenden m�ssen, werden Sie allerdings nach wie vor erhalten (zum Beispiel E-Mails, die Sie �ber �nderungen der Allgemeinen Nutzungsbedingungen informieren). 

### Verwendung von Daten durch Unternehmen der eBay-Gruppe

Zusätzlich können wir Daten an unsere Muttergesellschaft, die eBay Inc, ihre und unsere Tochtergesellschaften, Joint Ventures und andere Unternehmen weitergeben, die gemeinsam von Dritten beherrscht werden oder die uns oder andere Konzerngesellschaften gegebenenfalls übernehmen. Bei unserer weiteren geschäftlichen Entwicklung ist es denkbar, dass Shopping.com seine Aktiva, darunter auch personenbezogene Daten, im Zuge einer Fusion, Umstrukturierung, Veräußerung von Vermögenswerten oder Insolvenz ganz oder teilweise verkauft, überträgt oder anderweitig weitergibt. In diesem Fall können persönliche oder anonyme Daten zu den übertragenen Vermögenswerten zählen. 

Die eBay-Gruppe besteht momentan aus PayPal, Kijiji, half.com, rent.com and mobile.de (eine aktuelle Übersicht finden Sie unter [www.ebay.com/aboutebay.html](http://www.ebay.com/aboutebay.html)). Die Datenweitergabe erfolgt, um unsere Serviceleistungen und die Serviceleistungen der eBay-Gruppe zu verbessern. Die Weitergabe der Daten dient auch der Erstellung interner Statistiken, der Vorbereitung strategischer Entscheidungen, der Kundenverifizierung, dem Erkennen von Kundentrends, der Weitergabe von Bewertungen und Beurteilungen, der Mißbrauchsbekämpfung durch Betrugs- und Risikomanagement und der Sicherheit.

### Mitteilung und Weitergabe von Informationen und Daten

**Gesammelte Recherchedaten.** F�r die H�ndler des Shopping.com H�ndlerprogramms, andere Kunden, Medien und Interessierte erstellt Shopping.com Berichte und sammelt andere Informationen und Daten �ber Online-Shopping. Solche Informationen und Daten basieren auf gesammelten, anonymen Informationen �ber Millionen von Online-Kunden, beinhalten aber keine personenbezogenen Daten.

**Services von Partnern.** Shopping.com speichert in der Regel Daten, die von Nutzern erfasst werden, und gibt diese an bestimmte Partner weiter, um den Nutzern Serviceleistungen anzubieten. Um bestimmte Services auf der Website nutzen zu k�nnen, kann es notwendig sein, dass Sie Daten eingeben, die dann an unsere Partner weitergeleitet werden. Die Bereiche der Website, in denen Daten von unseren Partnern erfasst werden, k�nnen zus�tzlich mit dem Logo unserer Partner gekennzeichnet sein. F�r die Verwendung von Nutzerdaten sind in diesen F�llen die Datenschutzbestimmungen unserer jeweiligen Partner und nicht unsere Richtlinien ma�geblich. Vorbehaltlich der jeweiligen Datenschutzbestimmungen unserer Partner gehen die jeweils erfassten Daten in Kopie auch Shopping.com zu. Wenn Sie Fragen zu den Datenschutzbestimmungen oder Methoden der Datenerfassung eines unserer Gesch�ftspartner haben sollten, wenden Sie sich bitte direkt an den betreffenden Partner. Shopping.com hat keinerlei Einfluss auf die Datenerfassung und �nutzung unserer Gesch�ftspartner und ist daf�r auch nicht verantwortlich. 

**Besondere Angebote.** Auf unserer Website k�nnen Sie Ihr Interesse an Produkten und Serviceleistungen dritter Anbieter kundtun oder sich als Interessent registrieren lassen. Nutzen Sie diese M�glichkeit, leiten wir Daten �ber Sie an die jeweiligen Anbieter weiter, um Ihren W�nschen zu entsprechen. 

**Werbetreibende.** Wir nutzen unabh�ngige Werbe-Partner, die Ihnen bei Ihren Besuchen der Website Anzeigen pr�sentieren. Diese Werbe-Partner k�nnen anhand von Daten �ber Ihre Besuche auf unserer Website gezielt Anzeigen f�r Produkte und Dienstleistungen schalten, die f�r Sie von Interesse sein k�nnten. Dabei geben wir aber nicht Ihren Namen, Ihre Anschrift, E-Mail-Adresse und Telefonnummer weiter. 

Werbetreibende (zum Beispiel auch DoubleClick) k�nnen Cookies platzieren oder erkennen und, ob anhand dieser Cookies oder auf anderem Wege, Daten von Ihren Besuchen auf unserer und anderen Websites sammeln und nutzen, um Ihnen gezielt Anzeigen zu pr�sentieren. Mehr Informationen �ber das praktische Vorgehen von DoubleClick in Deutschland und Ihre Optionen in Bezug auf diese Datenerfassung und �nutzung finden Sie unter [DoubleClicks Datenschutzbestimmungen](http://emea.doubleclick.com/de/datenschutz/). 

**Sonstiges.** Es kann sein, dass wir Ihre Daten an unsere Konzerngesellschaften, Berater, Hersteller und Dienstleister weitergeben, die uns behilflich sind, die Website zu pflegen und entsprechende Serviceleistungen anzubieten, zum Beispiel die Online-Registrierung f�r Veranstaltungen. 

**Sonstige Weitergabe von Daten.** Wir k�nnen Daten offen legen, wenn wir gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet oder in gutem Glauben der �berzeugung sind, dass eine solche Offenlegung aufgrund von geltendem Recht notwendig ist, wenn es gesetzlich erlaubt ist, zur Erf�llung der rechtlichen Auflagen im Rahmen eines Gerichtsverfahrens, zum Schutz des Eigentums oder zur Wahrung der Interessen von Shopping.com, seiner Vertreter und Mitarbeiter, der pers�nlichen Sicherheit oder der �ffentlichkeit notwendig ist. Unter solchen Umst�nden kann es Shopping.com gesetzlich, durch Gerichtsbeschluss oder aufgrund anderer rechtlicher Verfahren untersagt sein, Sie �ber die Weitergabe Ihrer Daten zu unterrichten, und Shopping.com beh�lt sich vor, auf eine Benachrichtigung zu verzichten. Shopping.com hat seine europ�ischen Hauptsitz in Irland, und wir legen gro�en Wert darauf, die Bestimmungen der Datenschutzgesetze von 1988 und 2003 (Data Protection Act 1988 und 2003) einzuhalten. Ihre Informationen werden auch in den U.S.A. gespeichert und genutzt. Die gesetzlichen Datenschutzbestimmungen in den USA sind m�glicherweise weniger streng als die gesetzlichen Bestimmungen in der EU, aber Shopping.com wird bei der Speicherung und der �bertragung Ihrer Daten Sicherheitsmechanismen anwenden, um die Vertraulichkeit zu sch�tzen. 

### Sonstige Nutzung und Weitergabe von Daten für die Website 

**Inhalt und Bewertungen.** Sie k�nnen Beurteilungen, Stellungnahmen und andere Inhalte ver�ffentlichen. Mitglieder haben die Wahl, Produkte oder Produktbeurteilungen ihrerseits zu bewerten und so gewisserma�en registriertein Netz an Beziehungen aufzubauen, auf das Verlass ist. Auch nicht en Besuchern k�nnen wir gestatten, Produkte und/oder Produktbeurteilungen zu bewerten. 

Ihre Beurteilungsbewertungen und Aussagen sind f�r jedermann sichtbar, wenn Sie Ihre Standardkonfiguration nicht �ndern. Die Beurteilungen und Kommentare, die Sie ver�ffentlichen, erscheinen automatisch unter Ihrem Mitgliedsnamen, und andere Mitglieder haben die Wahl, sich per E-Mail von Ihren Ver�ffentlichungen benachrichtigen zu lassen oder eigene Kommentare zu Ihren Bewertungen abzugeben. 

Wir und unsere Lizenznehmer k�nnen, wie in unseren Allgemeinen Nutzungsbedingungen festgelegt, Ihre Inhalte erneut ver�ffentlichen. Wir ver�ffentlichen Produktbewertungen und ziehen diese zu Sammelbewertungen, zur Personalisierung von Website-Ansichten und zur Vermarktung von Produkten heran. Auch Ihre Bewertungen von Produktbeurteilungen und Ihr Netz an Beziehungen nutzen wir, um aufgerufene Websites zu personalisieren und popul�re Mitglieder ausfindig zu machen und besonders hervorzuheben. So k�nnen wir zum Beispiel die beliebtesten oder erfolgreichsten Beurteilungen und Mitglieder besonders herausstellen. Wir gehen zwar nicht davon aus, dass wir (au�er wie an anderer Stelle dieser Datenschutzbestimmungen beschrieben) die kompletten Bewertungen und das gesamte Netz an Beziehungen an Dritte �bertragen, setzen aber die Datenbank in unserem gesamten Netzwerk und zugunsten aller unserer Mitglieder ein.

**E-Mail-Tools.** Wenn Sie �ber unsere Website E-Mails verschicken, erscheint in Ihrer E-Mail Ihre E-Mail-Adresse und die pers�nliche Nachricht, die Sie gegebenenfalls verschickt haben. Auch wenn wir die Anschriften, an die Sie E-Mails verschicken, nicht so aufbewahren, dass sie leicht wieder abzurufen sind, stellen diese E-Mails trotzdem keinen privaten Schriftverkehr dar. Es ist Ihnen auch untersagt, die Tools, die wir Ihnen f�r den E-Mail-Versand bieten, zur Versendung von Spam oder Inhalten zu nutzen, die die Allgemeinen Nutzungsbedingungen verletzen.

**Feedback.** Wir k�nnen Sie im Rahmen einer Umfrage um Ihr Feedback bitten und die Ergebnisse f�r unsere interne Entwicklung und f�r Marktforschungszwecke nutzen. Gegebenenfalls d�rfen wir die Ergebnisse auch an unsere Konzerngesellschaften, Berater, Anbieter und Dienstleister weitergeben. 

### Links zu anderen Websites

Die Website enth�lt Links zu anderen Websites. Shopping.com ist nicht f�r den Datenschutz oder Inhalt dieser Websites verantwortlich. Wenn Sie Bedenken haben, wie andere Websites Daten �ber Sie erfassen und einsetzen, lesen Sie unbedingt die Datenschutzbestimmungen der jeweiligen Website. 

### Löschen oder Ändern Ihrer Daten

Registrierte Nutzer k�nnen ihre personenbezogenen Daten einsehen, �ndern oder l�schen , aber auch ihren Account l�schen, indem sie den [Kundenservice](https://web.archive.org/sc/customer-support) kontaktieren. Wir bem�hen uns, �nderungen in unseren Datenbanken schnellstm�glich zu ber�cksichtigen. Allerdings k�nnen nicht alle Datenbanken umgehend aktualisiert werden, und alte Daten k�nnen sich zum Teil in unseren Archiven und Akten halten. M�glicherweise sind wir auch nicht in der Lage, �nderungen, die Sie vornehmen, an Partner, Hersteller oder dritte Dienstleister weiterzugeben, die bereits Ihre Daten oder Inhalte erhalten haben. Wird Ihr Account oder Ihre Mitgliedschaft gek�ndigt oder ausgesetzt, k�nnen wir einige Daten l�ngerfristig speichern, um eine erneute Registrierung zu vermeiden. 

Unter bestimmten Umst�nden behalten wir Daten, um deren L�schung Sie gebeten haben, in unseren Akten, etwa zur L�sung von Streitigkeiten, Programmanalyse und Durchsetzung unserer Allgemeinen Nutzungsbedingungen. Zudem lassen sich solche alten Daten aufgrund technischer und rechtlicher Notwendigkeiten nie ganz aus unseren Datenbanken entfernen. Ein Grund hierf�r sind beispielsweise unsere Systeme zur Datensicherung, die regelm��ig Backup-Kopien speichern.

### Ihre Entscheidung/Verzicht auf E-Mail-Nachrichten von Shopping.com

Sie haben jederzeit (au�er bei E-Mails zu Verwaltungszwecken, wie oben erl�utert) die M�glichkeit, E-Mails oder personalisierte Werbung von Shopping.com und unseren Partnern zu stoppen. Wenn Sie Ihr Abonnement f�r den Shopping.com E-Mail-Newsletter k�ndigen m�chten, wenden Sie sich an den [Kundenservice](https://web.archive.org/sc/customer-support) und teilen Sie uns mit, dass Sie diesen Service nicht mehr in Anspruch nehmen m�chten. Au�erdem k�nnen Sie in Ihrem Nutzerkonto auf Shopping.com oder indem Sie die Anweisungen in den Kommunikationsmitteln (z.B. E-Mails) befolgen jederzeit festlegen, dass Sie keine E-Mails und keine personalisierte Werbung mehr erhalten m�chten. 

### Sicherheit

Shopping.com bem�ht sich mithilfe physikalischer, elektronischer und administrativer Sicherheitsvorkehrungen, etwa durch hochmoderne Firewalls und Passwort-gesch�tzten Zugriff auf unsere Datenbanken, um die Datensicherheit. Nur Mitarbeiter, die Ihre Daten kennen m�ssen, um unsere Services betreiben, weiterentwickeln oder verbessern zu k�nnen, bekommen Zugriff auf Ihre Daten. 

### Mitteilung von Änderungen

Diese Datenschutzbestimmungen k�nnen im Laufe der Zeit ge�ndert und unserer Gesch�ftsentwicklung angepasst werden. Wir werden eventuelle neue Richtlinien samt dem Datum der letzten �berarbeitung an augenf�lliger Stelle bekannt geben, so dass Sie stets wissen, welche Daten wir erfassen, wie wir diese Daten nutzen und ob wir sie an Dritte weitergeben. Bitte sehen Sie die Website regelm��ig auf Hinweise zu eventuellen �nderungen der Datenschutzbestimmungen durch.

### Cookies et rep�res Web

Nous utilisons �galement ces cookies pour affiner nos services, contenus, publicit�s, et offres promotionnelles 

Vous pouvez bloquer les cookies en modifiant les param�tres de votre navigateur (contactez votre fournisseur de services Internet pour obtenir de l'aide).

### Modifier ou supprimer des informations vous concernant

Les membres inscrits peuvent acc�der � leurs informations personnelles, les modifier ou les supprimer, ou encore annuler leur inscription en acc�dant � leur profil ou � leur compte. Nous tentons g�n�ralement de r�percuter ces modifications dans notre base de donn�es le plus rapidement possible. Toutes les bases de donn�es ne peuvent cependant pas �tre mises � jour de mani�re instantan�e et certaines donn�es anciennes peuvent �tre conserv�es dans nos archives pendant une courte p�riode, jusqu'� la mise � jour effective. Il peut aussi arriver que nous soyons dans l'impossibilit� d'envoyer vos modifications aux partenaires, fournisseurs ou prestataires de services tiers ayant d�j� re�u vos donn�es ou votre contenu. Si votre compte ou votre inscription sont r�sili�s ou suspendus, nous pouvons conserver certaines donn�es afin d'emp�cher toute r�inscription. 

Dans certains cas particuliers, nous conserverons certaines donn�es dont vous avez demand� la suppression, par exemple, pour r�soudre des litiges, analyser certains programmes et faire appliquer nos Conditions g�n�rales d'utilisation. Notez �galement que de telles informations ne sont jamais totalement effac�es de nos bases de donn�es en raison de contraintes techniques et l�gales, telles que les sauvegardes informatiques de s�curit�. 

### S�curit�

Pour assurer la s�curit� des donn�es, Shopping.com utilise des sauvegardes physiques, �lectroniques et administratives, notamment des syst�mes de protection avanc�e des bases de donn�es par pare-feu ou mot de passe. L'acc�s � vos donn�es personnelles est restreint aux employ�s qui ont besoin de conna�tre ces informations pour assurer le fonctionnement, le d�veloppement ou l'am�lioration de nos services. Comme vous le savez probablement, des tiers peuvent toutefois ill�galement intercepter ou acc�der � des transmissions ou des communications priv�es. Malgr� tous nos efforts pour assurer le respect de votre vie priv�e, nous ne pouvons pas garantir, et vous ne pouvez pas exiger, que vos informations personnelles ou vos messages priv�s conserveront toujours un caract�re confidentiel. 

### G�n�ral

Nous pouvons modifier r�guli�rement ce r�glement. Dans ce cas, nous publierons les nouvelles conditions sur le r�seau Shopping.com. Les modifications seront effectives imm�diatement pour les nouveaux utilisateurs et 30 jours apr�s leur publication pour les membres inscrits.

Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you've requested their services. 

**Service Providers.** We may share your information with service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as maintaining the Shopping.com Network and providing related services).

**Assets.** As our business evolves, Shopping.com may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such an event, personal information may be one of the assets transferred. 

**Other Disclosures.** We may disclose information when permitted by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary under applicable law; to comply with legal process served on Shopping.com; to protect the property or interests of Shopping.com, its agents and employees; or to protect personal safety or the public. 

### Public Content

Some portions of the Shopping.com Network allow you to contribute ratings, comments, reviews and other content. This content is displayed publicly unless you register and change your default configuration. The reviews and comments you publish may be displayed with your member name. If other members choose to, they can receive email notifications of your new public content or publish their own comments to your reviews. 

We may use the public content to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and market products. We may use your public content to personalize site views and identify or feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular or highest-earning reviews and members. While we don't expect to transfer the complete review rating and web of trust database to others (except as discussed in this policy), we use the database throughout our network and to generate results for others. 

### E-mail Communications

**Choice/Opt-Out.** At any time, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications (including customized ads) from the Shopping.com Network, but you may not opt out of administrative emails (for example, emails about your transactions or policy changes) while you are a member of the Shopping.com Network. You can opt out by either changing your preferences or by following the directions provided with the communication or advertisement. 

**Email Tools.** If you send emails to a recipient through our site, they will receive your email address and any personal message you include. Although we do not retain in any easily retrievable way the addresses you email, these emails are not private communications. You may not use our email tools to send spam or content that violates the User Agreement. 

**Anti-Spam Policy.** Shopping.com does not tolerate spam. We do not send emails to anyone without permission, and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any unauthorized third party. This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. If you believe that you have received an unsolicited email from us, please contact our [Privacy Department](https://web.archive.org/sc/contact-us) and we will investigate. 

### Cookies and Web Beacons

**Shopping.com's Cookies.** Shopping.com, other members of our corporate family who provide us with joint services, and our service providers will sometimes place anonymous cookies or web beacons on your computer when you visit our sites or our co-branded sites.

We also use cookies to customize services, content, advertising, and promotional offers.

### Changing or Deleting Information About You

Registered members may access, modify or remove their personal information or delete their membership account by accessing their Member Profile or Account information. We try to implement changes to our databases as quickly as possible. However, not all databases may be updated immediately, and some old data may remain in our archives and records for a short period until updated. Also, we may be unable to send changes you make to partners, vendors or third party service providers who have already received your data or content. If your account or membership is being terminated or suspended, we may maintain some data to prevent re-registration. 

We will retain in our files information you have requested to delete in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, analyze programs, enforce our User Agreement. Furthermore, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored "back up" systems. 

### Security

We restrict access to your personal information to employees that need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 

### General

**Service Providers.** We may share your information with service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as maintaining the Shopping.com Network and providing related services). 

**Special Offers.** On the Shopping.com Network, you may have opportunities to express interest in or register for third-party products and services. If you do, we will provide information about you to the third party to implement your request. 

**Feedback.** We may use survey results for our internal development and market research and share the results with our affiliates, consultants, vendors and service providers. 

**Assets.** As our business evolves, Shopping.com may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such an event, personal information may be one of the assets transferred. 

**Other Disclosures.** We may disclose information when permitted by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary under applicable law; to comply with legal process served on Shopping.com; to protect the property or interests of Shopping.com, its agents and employees; or to protect personal safety or the public. 

### Public Content

Some portions of the Shopping.com Network allow you to contribute ratings, comments, reviews and other content. This content is displayed publicly unless you register and change your default configuration. The reviews and comments you publish may be displayed with your member name. If other members choose to, they can receive email notifications of your new public content or publish their own comments to your reviews. 

We may use the public content to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and market products. We may use your public content to personalize site views and identify or feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular or highest-earning reviews and members. While we don't expect to transfer the complete review rating and web of trust database to others (except as discussed in this policy), we use the database throughout our network and to generate results for others. 

### E-mail Communications

**Choice/Opt-Out.** At any time, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications (including customized ads) from the Shopping.com Network, but you may not opt out of administrative emails (for example, emails about your transactions or policy changes) while you are a member of the Shopping.com Network. You can opt out by either changing your preferences or by following the directions provided with the communication or advertisement. 

**Email Tools.** If you send emails to a recipient through our site, they will receive your email address and any personal message you include. Although we do not retain in any easily retrievable way the addresses you email, these emails are not private communications. You may not use our email tools to send spam or content that violates the User Agreement. 

**Anti-Spam Policy.** Shopping.com does not tolerate spam. We do not send emails to anyone without permission, and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any unauthorized third party. This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. If you believe that you have received an unsolicited email from us, please contact our [Privacy Department](https://web.archive.org/sc/contact-us) and we will investigate. 

### Cookies and Web Beacons

**Shopping.com's Cookies.** Shopping.com, other members of our corporate family who provide us with joint services, and our service providers will sometimes place anonymous cookies or web beacons on your computer when you visit our sites or our co-branded sites. We use these cookies and web beacons to recognize returning users, measure traffic and activity on the sites, monitor and improve our services and protect against fraud. We also use cookies to customize services, content, advertising, and promotional offers. 

You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you. Your browser must be set to accept cookies in order to access the Shopping.com Network as a registered member. 

**Our Advertisers's Cookies.** We use the services of third-party advertising companies, who may place cookies that allow them to collect from you and use anonymous information about your visits to the Shopping.com Network.

### Links to Other Sites

The Sites contains links to other web sites. Shopping.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other web sites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site's own privacy policy. 

### Changing or Deleting Information About You

Registered members may access, modify or remove their personal information or delete their membership account by accessing their Member Profile or Account information. We try to implement changes to our databases as quickly as possible. However, not all databases may be updated immediately, and some old data may remain in our archives and records for a short period until updated. Also, we may be unable to send changes you make to partners, vendors or third party service providers who have already received your data or content. If your account or membership is being terminated or suspended, we may maintain some data to prevent re-registration. 

We will retain in our files information you have requested to delete in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, analyze programs, enforce our User Agreement. Furthermore, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored "back up" systems. 

### Security

Shopping.com uses physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, including advanced firewall and password protection for our databases, designed to protect the security of information. We restrict access to your personal information to employees that need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 

### General

We may change this policy from time to time, and we will post the amended terms on the Shopping.com Network. All amended terms will take effect immediately for new users, and 30 days after they are posted for existing users.
