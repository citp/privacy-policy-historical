<font style="font-size:14pt" color="#6F7C7D">
This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand how Bird Home Automation GmbH its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Bird Home Automation," "we," "us" or “our”) collect, use and safeguard the information you provide with us on this website or through our Services (as defined in our “Terms of Use”). By using or accessing our Services, you signify your acknowledgment and assent to the Privacy Policy set forth below. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Services. Bird Home Automation can revise this policy at any time by updating this posting, and your use after such change signifies your acceptance of the changed terms.

<h3>Collection of personal information</h3>
If you browse the Bird Home Automation website, you may generally do so anonymously without providing any personal information. However, there are cases in which we may ask you for personal data. For example, we will occasionally conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs and profile of our visitors. In addition, we may request personal information when you register to receive additional information regarding our products and services, download software, sign up for a newsletter or send us a question. Even if you choose not to give information we request, you can still visit most of the Bird Home Automation website, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services. In case you change your mind or wish to update or delete personal information, we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this by contacting us at the contact specified below.

<h3>Your device</h3>
For reasons of brevity, we use the terms "device" to refer to our "DoorBird Video Door Station" and "BirdGuard" products and "mobile device" to refer to a smartphone or tablet.
<br><u>Information input during setup:</u> When you install your device, you may be asked for certain basic information like your device name, description, ZIP or postal code, as well as where you’re installing it. This information is used to personalize your experience – for example, to tell you which device is triggering a notification.
<br><u>Environmental data from device sensors:</u> We collect data from sensors built into DoorBird Video Door Stations / BirdGuard cameras. These sensors collect data such as device temperature and ambient light. By recording this information, device can know, for instance, whether it’s dark and it should turn on night vision.
<br><u>Video and audio signals and data:</u> After you begin using your device, we may process information from your device so that we can send you alerts when your doorbell is pressed or when your device detects motion. This may include capturing and emailing to you portions of this data as part of a notification or analyzing the data to identify motion or other events. When you access our Cloud Service on a trial basis or a subscription basis, we will record and process video and/or audio recordings from your device. In addition, we will capture, process and retain video and audio data recordings from your device for the duration of your recording subscription period and you will be able to access those recordings using the Services during that time.
<br><u>Technical information from the device:</u> In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with device, we may record your device serial number, software version, and technical information such as Wi-Fi signal strength.
<br><u>Saved and Shared Content:</u> You may save and may choose to share certain content like video clips, images, captions, and comments for other people to access using the Services. We will collect and store information that will allow us to save or share your content as directed by you through the Services.
<br><br>Data protection and privacy laws in your country may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of the device. You are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws when you use the device. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home that you are using the device. Note in particular that recording and sharing clips that involve other people may affect their privacy and data protection rights. Also check the data privacy information in the installation manual of your device.

<h3>Orders</h3>
When you place an order for a product or service, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This personal information is required so that we can process and fulfill your order, send an order or shipping confirmation, as well as notify you of your order status. Also, once you place an order, we may send you informational emails about our products and services, including promotional offers. If you do not wish to receive such emails from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by emailing us at hello@doorbird.com. Also, once you place an order or make an inquiry regarding our products, we may send you informational emails about our products and services, including promotional offers.

<h3>Bird Home Automations Mailings/Marketing Communications</h3>

While we use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, Bird Home Automation will have no liability for disclosure of any information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.
We may share your personal information with our third party service providers on a need- to-know basis. We engage third party service providers to perform certain services on our behalf.
