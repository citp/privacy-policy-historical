DealTime.com, and PriceTool.com websites (including the versions of these sites
in foreign jurisdictions), their sister sites, and all co-branded versions of
these sites or any successor brand that eBay may designate from time to time in
its discretion (in the United States or foreign jurisdictions), which are
referred to collectively as the “eBay Commerce Network” or “ECN,” along with
their related sites, applications, services, and tools, regardless of how you
access or use them, including through mobile devices.</p>

If you do, we will provide information about you to the third party to implement your request;</li>
<li class="unorderedList">Law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other eBay Commerce Network user to legal liability. In such events, we will only disclose information relevant and necessary to the investigation or inquiry, such as name, city, state, ZIP code, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, and anything else we may deem relevant to the investigation;</li>
<li class="unorderedList">Credit bureaus with which we may report information about your account, including information on late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report;</li>
<li class="unorderedList">Other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information would be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice); and/or</li>
<li class="unorderedList">For our internal development and market research, we may collect survey information from you and share the results with our affiliates, consultants, vendors and service providers as applicable and authorized by this Privacy Policy.</li>

                <p>Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties only if such parties have a subpoena, court order, or substantially similar legal procedure, or if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</p>
				
				
                <a name="info1"></a><h3 class="sectionTtl1">Information You Share on Site</h3>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">Some portions of the eBay Commerce Network allow you to contribute ratings, reviews, tags, comments, and other content, either on one of our websites or via our product review services on other websites. This content may be displayed publicly on the eBay Commerce Network and elsewhere on the web. The reviews and comments you publish may be displayed with your member or user name. Registered members can publish reviews by logging in to their accounts; reviews submitted through our product review services cannot be deleted once uploaded. For some of our features, other members may be able to request email notifications of your new public content or publish their own comments to your reviews. You can also choose to make your wish lists private, but they are public by default. </p>
                <p>We may use the public content to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views, market products or identify or feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular or highest-earning reviews and members. While we do not expect to transfer the complete review rating and web of trust database to others (except as discussed in this policy), we use the database throughout our network and to generate results for others.</p>	
				<p>Your ECN User ID is displayed throughout the eBay Commerce Network (and so it is available to the public), and is connected to all of your ECN activity. This means that other people can see the feedback, ratings, and comments associated with your User ID. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites likewise refer to specific User IDs. Therefore, if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your ECN activities. </p>
<p>If you access our sites from a shared computer or a computer in an internet café, you must log out of your account after use, or else certain information about you such as your User ID, activity, or reminders from eBay may be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you.</p>
