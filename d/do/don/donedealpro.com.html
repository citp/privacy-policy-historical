			<p align="center" style="TEXT-ALIGN:center"></p><h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

			<img src="/images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="4" border="0"><br>
			
			<h1>Overview
			</h1>
			<p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies of Done Deal Pro ("<i>we</i>") 
				regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of the following types 
				of information:
			</p>
			<p>Information obtained when you and other users ("<i>you</i>" or 
				"<i>Users</i>") visit the <a href="http://www.donedealpro.com/"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">
						www.donedealpro.com</span></a> web site (the "<i>Site</i>").
			</p>
			<p>Information obtained through email communications with you 
				related to the Site.
			</p>
			
			<p>This privacy policy does not apply to information that we may 
				collect from you by other means (including offline) or from other sources, nor 
				does it apply with respect to information you provide to other Done Deal web 
				sites. Your use of this Site constitutes your acceptance of all of the terms 
				and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy and your consent to any action 
				we take with respect to your information that is in compliance with this 
				Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			
			<p>We may change the terms of this Privacy Policy, so Users are 
				encouraged to review this page from time to time. Your continued use of this 
				Site following the posting of changes to the Privacy Policy means that you 
				accept the changes.
			</p>
			
			<p>If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, as modified from 
				time to time, please do not visit or subscribe to this Site.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Information We Collect and How We Collect It
			</h1>
			
			<p>General
			</p>
			
			<p>We require you to provide us with certain information about 
				yourself when you register with this Site and when you request products and 
				services. We may also collect information from you when you participate in 
				contests and surveys, when you respond to requests for feedback and when you 
				submit postings to public areas of this Site, such as moderated discussions and 
				message boards.
			</p>
			
			<p>The information we collect may include information from which 
				you may be personally identified ("<i>Personally Identifiable Information</i>"), 
				such as name, postal address, telephone number, fax number and email address, 
				and also may include certain business information, such as employer name, 
				occupation, job function, job title and buying information (e.g., preferences 
				or history). We also will collect credit card and related information when you 
				request a product or service (including registering for the Site) for which 
				there is a charge. This Site only collects Personally Identifiable Information 
				with your knowledge.
			</p>
			
			<p>Automatic Data Collection
			</p>
			
			<p>When you visit this Site, we may collect the IP address of 
				your computer.
			</p>
			
			<p>We also automatically record other information that identifies 
				your computer to this Site and tracks your behavior on the Site. For example, 
				we may record how many times you visit this Site and your navigation within the 
				Site. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information in this manner; 
				however, if you provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, we may 
				associate that information with the information that is collected 
				automatically.
			</p>
			
			<p>Methods used to collect this information may include "cookies" 
				and "clear GIFs" (also known as "pixel tags" or "beacons"). A cookie is a small 
				amount of data that is sent to your browser from a server and stored on your 
				computer's hard drive. Most browsers allow Users to block the receipt of 
				cookies, but doing so may compromise your ability to use certain features of 
				this Site. A clear GIF is a small graphic image, typically used in connection 
				with cookies, that is placed on a web site or in an email message. A clear GIF 
				can monitor certain user behavior, such as your usage of the web site, whether 
				you opened an email message or whether you clicked on a URL in an email 
				message.
			</p>
			
			<p>Some of the materials included on this Site, including 
				advertising, may be served by third parties. These third parties, in the course 
				of serving such materials, may collect information regarding your use of this 
				Site and how you respond to email communications, using methods that may 
				include those described in the preceding paragraph. Collection, use, disclosure 
				and security of information collected by third parties are subject to the 
				privacy policies of those third parties.
			</p>
			
			<h1>How We Use Your Information
			</h1>
			
			<p>General
			</p>
			
			<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information that we collect on 
				this Site for the following purposes:
			</p>
			
			<p>To provide you with this Site and other products and services, 
				such as electronic and print publications and newsletters.
			</p>
			
			<p>To respond to your inquiries and contact you about changes 
				regarding the Site.
			</p>
			
			<p>To provide you with email, fax and other notices (such as 
				expiration and renewal notices) and inquiries regarding your account and the 
				products or services that you are receiving, and for billing and collection 
				purposes.
			</p>
			
			<p>For any other purpose disclosed at the time the information is 
				collected or to which you consent.
			</p>
			
			<p>As otherwise specifically described in this Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			
			<p>We also may use your information to better understand the 
				needs of our Users and to improve our Site. For example, we may use this 
				information to determine what portions of the Site are most popular and the 
				demographics of our Users generally. Cookies and other User information also 
				enable us to customize your experience on the Site.
			</p>
			
			<p>We may use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our 
				servers or to administer our Site. We may also use IP addresses to help 
				identify a User during a particular session and to gather data regarding use of 
				the Site.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Newsletters and Offers
			</h1>
			
			<p>We may use the information you provide us to send you email, 
				fax and other communications on behalf of Done Deal Pro or other Done Deal 
				divisions. These communications may include email newsletters that are relevant 
				to this Site, as well as offers for other Done Deal services. All of these 
				communications will include instructions explaining how you can request that we 
				not send you ("<i>opt out</i>" of) future communications of the same type.
			</p>
			
			<p>We may use your information to send you email, fax and other 
				communications on behalf of unaffiliated third parties, but only if you opt in 
				to receiving such offers when you register. Each of these communications will 
				include instructions for opting out of receiving future third party offers from 
				us. You also may change your preference with regard to receiving third party 
				offers from this Web Site at any time on the registration page of this Site.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Our Disclosure of Your Information
			</h1>
			
			<p>We will not disclose your information to anyone outside of 
				Done Deal Pro or other Done Deal divisions, except as described in this 
				section.
			</p>
			
			<p>We may disclose aggregated anonymous statistics about many 
				Users to advertisers, content and service providers and other affiliated and 
				unaffiliated companies.
			</p>
			
			<p>We sometimes engage third parties to perform services for us, 
				including in connection with this Site, that require us to disclose Users' 
				Personally Identifiable Information to them. If we make any such disclosure, we 
				will require such parties to keep the information confidential and to use it 
				only to perform the services.
			</p>
			
			<p>We may from time to time wish to disclose your information to 
				third parties that wish to market, or provide information about, their products 
				and services to you. We will only do so after obtaining your permission. The 
				only other times we may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information 
				collected on this Site are as follows:
			</p>
			
			<p>In the event of an asset sale, merger, consolidation, 
				restructuring, reorganization, liquidation or other similar transaction 
				involving Done Deal or this Site, we may transfer some or all User information, 
				including Personally Identifiable Information, to the successor company.
			</p>
			
			<p>We will disclose your Personally Identifiable Information when 
				we believe such disclosure is required by law or for the protection of persons 
				or property.
			</p>
			
			<p>We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information with 
				your consent, as well as when disclosure is necessary to accomplish the purpose 
				for which you provide it.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Security
			</h1>
			
			<p>We use reasonable security safeguards to protect Personally 
				Identifiable Information we collect on this Site from unauthorized access, use, 
				modification or disclosure. However, due to the design of the Internet and 
				other factors outside of our control, we cannot guarantee that communications 
				between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third 
				parties.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Right to Access and Change Information
			</h1>
			
			<p>You may view and update information that you previously 
				submitted to this Site by visiting the registration page for this Site. 
				However, a request to change information may not be accommodated if the request 
				would conflict with legal requirements or result in incorrect information. 
				Requests to view or change personal information may take a few days to process.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Links
			</h1>
			
			<p>This Site may contain content, services, advertising and other 
				materials that link to Web sites operated by third parties. We have no control 
				over those other sites, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to them. We 
				encourage you to refer to the privacy policies, if any, of those sites.
