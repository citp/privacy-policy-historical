**Privacy Policy  
DonorsChoose.org**

DonorsChoose (DC) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information provided by visitors to our web sites. We have created the following data collection policies to demonstrate our commitment to the issue of privacy. 

_Web Site User Information Collected by DC_  
DC collects information about users during their registration for some of our websites, on-line surveys, discussion forums, opted-in e-mail newsletters, and through the use of cookies. When web site users request pages, our server automatically recognizes and collects the domain name and IP address of visitors to our web sites. 

_Use of Information_  
DC takes every precaution to protect users' information from unauthorized use. When users submit sensitive information via our web sites, the information is considered confidential both on-line and off-line. We do not allow public access to the portion of the server that contains user information. 

Email addresses provided to us will only be used to send relevant and important DC correspondence. DC strictly enforces e-mail privacy and therefore, e-mail addresses are never sold or provided to third parties. Additionally, upon request, DC will remove users (and their information) from our database or permit them to "opt-out" of any further e-mail newsletters that they had previously signed up for. 

Our web server automatically recognizes and collects the domain name and IP address of visitors to our web sites. In addition, we collect aggregate tracking information derived mainly from tallying page views throughout our sites, and information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and/or site registrations. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web pages and to customize the content and/or layout for each individual visitor. 

If a visitor has enabled cookies in their browser, we will send a cookie file that will only store a unique, random session ID that is maintained throughout the session to track the pages visited. This allows us to provide our site visitors with certain conveniences, such as delivering unique content and helping with lost passwords. 

Postal addresses collected on-line may be used for periodic mailings from us. 

_General Information_  
DC is not responsible for the content or the privacy polices of websites to which it may provide links or the websites of its advertisers. 

If you have questions about this privacy statement, please do not hesitate to contact us at [info@donorschoose.org](mailto:info@donorschoose.org).
