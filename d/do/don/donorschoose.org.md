**Privacy Policy  
DonorsChoose.org**

This document contains the privacy practices for the DonorsChoose.org web site and DC's other web sites (collectively, the "Sites"). These Sites are owned and operated by or on behalf of DonorsChoose.org, Inc. ("DC"). We at DC take your privacy seriously. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the information that is collected about you on the Sites, how DC may use and disclose the information that is collected, how information can be corrected or changed, and your obligations regarding information about others you may encounter in using the Sites. Please note that this Privacy Policy only governs information gathered from you online through these Sites. 

1\. _How Does DC Collect Information?_

Our web server automatically recognizes and collects the domain name and IP address of visitors to our Sites. In addition, we collect information volunteered by the visitor to participate in activities on the Sites, such as making a donation, purchasing or redeeming a gift certificate, funding a project in someone's honor, opening a gift registry of favorite projects, creating or participating in a challenge, responding to surveys, registering to create an account, requesting email newsletters and/or contacting us through one or more of our contact email addresses. DC also collects personal information when you create an account. When you create an account we ask for information such as your name, email address, postal address, and phone number. If a visitor has enabled cookies in their browser, we also will send a cookie file that will only store a unique, random session ID that is maintained throughout the session to track the pages visited, allowing us to provide visitors to our Sites with certain conveniences, such as delivering unique content. We also use cookies to track the path of users through our Sites, and to keep track of where they came from (for example, if they arrive via a search engine). We also collect aggregate tracking information derived mainly from tallying page views throughout our Sites. 

2\. _How Does DC Protect Information?_

DC exerts reasonable efforts to protect personal information received from users of our Sites from unauthorized use or disclosure. We do not allow unauthorized access via the Internet to the portion of our server that contains personally identifiable user information. All credit card information provided as requested on the Sites for donations is encrypted using the SSL protocol and we do not retain any end-user credit card information after the processing of the transaction is complete. 

3\. _How Does DC Use Information?_

3.1 _General_. DC uses information for the following general purposes: to evaluate proposals to fund student projects, provide information regarding approved proposals to the Sites' visitors and potential donors, to customize the content and/or layout of the Sites for each individual user, to improve the content of our Sites, our services or programs, and to contact you. 

3.2 _Contacting You_. By creating an account on a Site, you agree to receive emails based on transactional activity, which may include confirmation emails, receipts, acknowledgement messages, updates on proposals you've funded, or updates on teacher feedback. You can also sign up for extra email updates and news ("Extra Email Updates and News") from the Sites. You can unsubscribe from those Extra Email Updates and News at any time by contacting DC or logging into your Site account and adjusting your "Contact Me" settings or by using the link found on the email message to unsubscribe. 

Email addresses provided by users of the Sites will only be used to send email from or related to DC and its programs. DC strictly enforces e-mail privacy, and e-mail addresses are not sold, leased or bartered to or with any third parties. 

Postal addresses collected on-line may be used for various mailings from DC and its affiliates, including the forwarding of student and teacher thank you letters or other correspondence and pictures in appreciation of your donation. Postal addresses are not sold, leased or bartered to or with any third parties.

3.4 _Aggregate Data_. DC may collect information about the use of the Sites, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily.

6.2 _Verification Of Affiliation_. The contact information (name, postal address, email address and telephone number) of teachers who have indicated an affiliation with a teacher organization (e.g., RISE Network, Barksdale Reading Institute, Teach For America, New York Teaching Fellow) may be shared with the associated organization for purposes of verification that the teacher belongs to the organization (See Section 4 above). However, our agreements with the affiliated organizations only permit them to use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function and prohibits them from using it for any other purpose. The name and postal address of teachers who have indicated an affiliation with a teacher organization may also be provided to teachers who have indicated the same affiliation-so as to enable authentication of a teacher's affiliation.
