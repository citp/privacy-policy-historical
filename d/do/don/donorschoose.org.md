**Privacy Policy  
DonorsChoose.org**

This document contains the privacy practices for the www.DonorsChoose.org web site (the "Site"). This Site is owned and operated by DonorsChoose, Inc. (DC). We at DC take your privacy seriously. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the information that is collected about you on the Site, how DC may use and disclose the information that is collected, how information can be corrected or changed, and your obligations regarding information about others you may encounter in using the Site. Please note that this Privacy Policy only governs information gathered from you online through this Site. 

This Privacy Policy may be changed or updated by us from time to time by posting such changes on the Site. 

_How Does DC Collect Information?_  
Our web server automatically recognizes and collects the domain name and IP address of visitors to our Site. In addition, we collect information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and/or Site User registration data and email newsletter requests. If a visitor has enabled cookies in their browser, we will send a cookie file that will only store a unique, random session ID that is maintained throughout the session to track the pages visited, allowing us to provide Site visitors with certain conveniences, such as delivering unique content and helping registered users with lost passwords. We also use cookies to track the path of users through our Site, and to keep track of where they came from (for example, if they arrive via Google or another search engine). We also collect aggregate tracking information derived mainly from tallying page views throughout our Site. 

_How Does DC Protect Information?_  
DC exerts reasonable efforts to protect personal information received from Site users from unauthorized use or disclosure. We do not allow public access to the portion of our server that contains personally identifiable user information. All credit card information provided as requested on the Site for donations is encrypted using the SSL protocol. 

_How Does DC Use Information?_  
Email addresses provided by users of the Site will only be used to send email from or related to DC and its programs. DC strictly enforces e-mail privacy, and e-mail addresses are not sold, leased or bartered to or with any third parties. We are pleased to provide our email newsletter to users of the Site; however, if you no longer wish to receive our email newsletter, please use the "opt-out" function at the bottom of each email newsletter or, if you are a registered Site user, you may also log on and go to My Account where you can uncheck the applicable boxes. Financial information collected through the Site is used only for the purpose(s) for which it was collected. Postal addresses collected on-line may be used for various mailings from DC and its affiliates. Other information we collect is used to improve the Contents of our Site and to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual visitor. 

Organizations other than DC may be engaged by DC to perform a variety of functions, such as assisting with donation collection and providing technical services for our Site. These organizations may have access to your personal information if necessary to perform such functions; however, they may only use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function and may not use it for any other purpose. 

When a Site visitor creates a gift registry account enabling Donors to contribute funds for a specific project in honor of a named person (for example, contributing funds to honor someone's birthday, anniversary or other special event), the named person's first and last name may be displayed to various Site users; however, no other personal information about the named person will be disclosed on the Site. 

Other than as provided above, DC does not disclose personal information to third parties unless we reasonably believe either that the law requires it, or that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, the rights of another user or person, or to prevent harm. We reserve the right to disclose any personal information as reasonably necessary, in our judgment, to protect DC or its assets or to comply with law or with appropriate requests or directions made by law enforcement, government agencies or any court. 

_Third Party Websites_  
DC is not responsible for the contents, services or the privacy polices or practices of websites to which we may provide hyperlinks from this Site, or of the websites of its affiliates or sponsors.
