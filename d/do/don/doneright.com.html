			<b>Personal Information.</b>
			We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share all types of personal information with:
			</p><ul>
				<li>
					<b>Authorized Service Providers.</b>
					Prior to your contacting a Done Right! Service Provider, your contact information will not be supplied to any Done Right! Service Provider. Once you have called a Done Right! Service Provider through Done Right!, the Service Provider you called may, as described in the paragraph above, receive your contact information. If the Service Provider you contacted has been de-listed, suspended or has otherwise exited the Done Right! Program before we are able to effectively stop marketing the Service Provider, we may supply your contact information to a Done Right! Service Provider in-good-standing who offers the same class of service(s). 
					<p>
						When you contact (by phone or Internet) one of our approved Done Right! Service Providers through Done Right!, the Service Provider you contact very often receives a record of the phone number you called from and, by the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Done Right! Terms of Use Agreement, is allowed to call you back. As indicated above, once you establish contact with a Done Right! Service Provider you are no longer just a customer of Done Right!, but also a customer of the Service Provider. As a result, you become subject to the Service Provider's own marketing and privacy policies and practices (for which Done Right! bears no responsibility).
					</p>
					<p>
						The phone number you supply us with to secure the benefits of the Done Right! Guarantee will not be supplied by us to any Done Right! Service Provider unless you have previously called that Service Provider using a number listed in one of Done Right!'s various marketing vehicles. We use the collected information to alert you regarding important changes to our services, including our websites.
					</p>
					<p>
						We use your return e-mail address(es) to answer the e-mail we receive.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Business Partners/Third Parties</b>
					When you express interest in products, services or promotions offered through our websites or our services, we may share your expression of interest with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes, and, as applicable, their affiliates and third-party finder or marketing companies. When you elect to engage in a particular offer or program, you authorize us to provide your e-mail address and other information to those businesses.   However, unlike the service providers listed in the DoneRight! Directory, who you called, these third parties (with the exception of market research vendors we hire to learn more about our service), will not contact you directly without your consent.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Other LendingTree and Tree.com Businesses</b>.
					We may share information we collect, including personal information, with other Tree.com companies. Sharing information with Tree.com companies enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that might interest you. All Tree.com companies comply with this Privacy Policy or a similar Privacy Policy. Tree.com companies also will comply with applicable privacy and security laws and, at a minimum, in any commercial e-mail they send to you, will give you the opportunity to choose not to receive such e-mail messages from that company in the future. However, in no circumstance will any Tree.com company share with other Tree.com companies any personally identifiable information that you provide to us if that information bears on your creditworthiness.

			<b>Aggregated and Non-Personal Information.</b>
			We may share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties, and other Tree.com companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our websites and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Third Party Websites.</b>
			There are a number of places on Tree.com and its companiesÕ websites where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our websites, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

			We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.

			<b>Children's Privacy </b>
			<br>Our websites are general audience sites, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Visiting our Websites From Outside the United States</b>
			<br>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our websites from residents of the United States as Done Right! services are not offered to individuals residing outside the United States. Accordingly, such individuals are not authorized to submit any information to us. In any event, this Privacy Policy may not be applicable in all countries where web sites are accessible, as security policies may vary according to the individual Internet laws in each host country. If you are visiting our websites from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>No Rights of Third Parties</b>
			<br>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of our websites.
		</p>		
		<p>
			<b>Changes to this Privacy Policy </b>
			<br>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share personal information that may impact you, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an e-mail address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our websites. We recommend that you check our websites from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies. 
		</p>		
		<p>
			<b>Recording of Calls </b>
			<br>We may, occasionally, record the calls placed to our approved Service Providers to ensure that calls are answered in a prompt and professional manner and for other quality control purposes. Whenever there is a chance that a call may be recorded, the caller hears a message advising that "this call may be recorded for quality purposes." The calls are used by us and our approved research vendors and are never made available to the public, but an anonymous transcript or summary may be shared with our approved Service Providers in an effort to help them improve their business practices.
