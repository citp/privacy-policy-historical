</p><p>This document contains the privacy practices for the DonorsChoose.org web site and DC's other web sites (collectively, the "Sites"). These Sites are owned and operated by or on behalf of DonorsChoose.org ("DC"). We at DC take your privacy seriously. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the information that is collected about you on the Sites, how DC may use and disclose the information that is collected, how information can be corrected or changed, and your obligations regarding information about others you may encounter in using the Sites.

</p><p>2.	<em>How Does DC Protect Information?</em>
</p><p>DC exerts reasonable efforts to protect personal information received from users of our Sites from unauthorized use or disclosure. We do not allow unauthorized access via the Internet to the portion of our server that contains personally identifiable user information. All credit card information provided as requested on the Sites for donations is encrypted using the SSL protocol and we do not retain any end-user credit card information after the processing of the transaction is complete.

</p><p>6.2	<u>Verification Of Affiliation</u>.  The contact information (name, postal address, email address and telephone number) of teachers who have indicated an affiliation with a teacher organization (e.g., RISE Network, Barksdale Reading Institute, Teach For America, New York Teaching Fellow) may be shared with the associated organization for purposes of verification that the teacher belongs to the organization (See Section 4 above). However, our agreements with the affiliated organizations only permit them to use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function and prohibits them from using it for any other purpose.
