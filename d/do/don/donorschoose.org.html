<p><strong>Privacy Policy
<br>DonorsChoose.org</strong>
</p><p>This document contains the privacy practices for the DonorsChoose.org web site and DC's other web sites (collectively, the "Sites"). These Sites are owned and operated by or on behalf of DonorsChoose.org ("DC"). We at DC take your privacy seriously. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the information that is collected about you on the Sites, how DC may use and disclose the information that is collected, how information can be corrected or changed, and your obligations regarding information about others you may encounter in using the Sites. Please note that this Privacy Policy only governs information gathered from you online through these Sites. 
</p><p>1.	<em>How Does DC Collect Information?</em>
</p><p>Our web server automatically recognizes and collects the domain name and IP address of visitors to our Sites. In addition, we collect information volunteered by the visitor to participate in activities on the Sites, such as making a donation, purchasing or redeeming a GivingCard, funding a project in someone's honor, opening a gift registry of favorite projects, creating or participating in a challenge, responding to surveys, registering to create an account, requesting email newsletters and/or contacting us through one or more of our contact email addresses. DC also collects personal information when you create an account. When you create an account we ask for information such as your name, email address, postal address, and phone number. If a visitor has enabled cookies in their browser, we also will send a cookie file that will only store a unique, random session ID that is maintained throughout the session to track the pages visited, allowing us to provide visitors to our Sites with certain conveniences, such as delivering unique content. We also use cookies to track the path of users through our Sites, and to keep track of where they came from (for example, if they arrive via a search engine). We also collect aggregate tracking information derived mainly from tallying page views throughout our Sites. 
</p><p>2.	<em>How Does DC Protect Information?</em>
</p><p>DC exerts reasonable efforts to protect personal information received from users of our Sites from unauthorized use or disclosure. We do not allow unauthorized access via the Internet to the portion of our server that contains personally identifiable user information. All credit card information provided as requested on the Sites for donations is encrypted using the SSL protocol and we do not retain any end-user credit card information after the processing of the transaction is complete. 
</p><p>3.	<em>How Does DC Use Information? </em>
</p><p>3.1	<u>General</u>.  DC uses information for the following general purposes: to evaluate proposals to fund student projects, provide information regarding approved proposals to the Sites' visitors and potential donors, to customize the content and/or layout of the Sites for each individual user, to improve the content of our Sites, our services or programs, and to contact you. 
</p><p>3.2	<u>Contacting You</u>. By creating an account on a Site, you agree to receive emails based on transactional activity, which may include confirmation emails, receipts, acknowledgement messages, updates on proposals you've funded, or updates on teacher feedback. You can also sign up for extra email updates and news ("Extra Email Updates and News") from the Sites. You can unsubscribe from those Extra Email Updates and News at any time by contacting DC or logging into your Site account and adjusting your "Contact Me" settings or by using the link found on the email message to unsubscribe.
</p><p>Email addresses provided by users of the Sites will only be used to send email from or related to DC and its programs. DC strictly enforces e-mail privacy, and e-mail addresses are not sold, leased or bartered to or with any third parties.
</p><p>Postal addresses collected on-line may be used for various mailings from DC and its affiliates, including the forwarding of student and teacher thank you letters or other correspondence and pictures in appreciation of your donation.   Postal addresses are not sold, leased or bartered to or with any third parties.
</p><p>3.3	<u>Donations, Registries and Other Services</u>. By voluntarily providing us with your name, credit card information, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, billing address, and any other personally identifiable information, you consent to our use of such information for the purpose(s) for which it was collected, such as processing your donations, issuing or redeeming GivingCards, opening a gift registry, funding a project in someone's honor, and/or for providing any other service or product you request. 
</p><p>3.4	<u>Aggregate Data</u>.  DC may collect information about the use of the Sites, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. DC may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing or similar promotional purposes. This may include disclosure of this information to a third party market analysis firm.
</p><p>4.	<em>How Does DC Disclose Information?</em>
</p><p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others without your express consent.  We disclose your personal information only to process your credit card donations, or in the following circumstances: 
</p><p>4.1	<u>Governmental Order</u>.  DC may provide your personal information if necessary, in DC's good faith judgment, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or in response to a valid subpoena, warrant or order or to protect the rights of DC or others. 
</p><p>4.2	<u>Business Transition</u>.  If DC goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we reserve the right to transfer your personal information, which will likely be among the assets transferred. 
</p><p>4.2	<u>Contractors and Other Third Party Service Providers</u>.  DC may employ contractors or other third parties. These contractors or other third parties may have access to your personal information if necessary to perform services for us; however, they may only use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function and may not use it for any other purpose. 
</p><p>4.3	<u>Gift Registry</u>.  When a visitor to a Site creates a gift registry account enabling donors to contribute funds for a specific project in honor of a named person (for example, contributing funds to honor someone's birthday, anniversary or other special event), the named person's first and last name may be displayed to various users of the Sites; however, no other personal information about the named person will be disclosed on the Sites. By providing such named person's first and last name, you represent to DC that you have permission to provide and grant DC the right to disclose such information. 
</p><p>4.4	<u>GivingCards</u>.  The name, donation amount, and redemption code of donors who redeem GivingCards issued by DC's corporate partners will be shared with the company that issued the donor the GivingCard. DC is not responsible for the privacy practices of those companies. For more information regarding the handling of your information by those companies, please refer to the privacy policies of those companies. For more information regarding redemption of GivingCards, you can email us at giftcertificates@donorschoose.org. 
</p><p>4.5	<u>Matching Contributions</u>.  We may disclose your contact information (name, postal address, email address and telephone number) and donation information (donation amount and supported projects) to your employer if you have notified us that your employer will match your donation for the purposes of enabling your employer to make a matching donation. DC is not responsible for the privacy practices of your employer. For more information regarding the handling of your information by your employer, please refer to your employer's privacy policies. 
</p><p>4.6	<u>Teach For America</u>.  The contact information (name, postal address, email address and telephone number) and donation information (donation amount and supported projects) of visitors who enter the Sites by way of DC's special Teach For America ("TFA") page at <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/teachforamerica">www.donorschoose.org/teachforamerica</a> and make a donation to DC will be shared with TFA. DC is not responsible for the privacy practices of TFA. For more information regarding the handling of your information by TFA, please refer to TFA's privacy policies. For more information regarding donations by TFA supporters, you can send us an email at tfa@donorschoose.org. 
</p><p>4.7	<u>SAS</u>. The contact information (name, postal address, email address and telephone number) and donation information (donation amount and supported projects) of SAS employees who enter the Sites by way of DC's special SAS page at <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/sas">www.donorschoose.org/sas</a> and make a donation to DC will be shared with SAS for the purpose of enabling SAS to make a matching donation. DC is not responsible for the privacy practices of SAS. For more information regarding the handling of your information by SAS, please refer to SAS' privacy policies. For more information regarding donations by SAS employees, you can send us an email at sas@donorschoose.org. 
</p><p>4.8	Third Party Websites.  DC is not responsible for the contents, services or the privacy polices or practices of websites to which we may provide hyperlinks from these Sites, or of the websites of its affiliates, sponsors or corporate partners. 
</p><p>5.	<em>A Note to Parents</em>
</p><p>Use of the Sites by children (defined as persons under the age of 18) (permitted under the <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/help/user_agreement.html">User Agreement</a> with parental consent and supervision) does not require disclosure of any personal information about the child. DC does not wish or intend for any child to provide personally identifiable data to DC through use of the Sites. 
</p><p>6.	<em>Teachers.</em>
</p><p>The following additional terms apply to those users who sign up for a teacher account and/or are approved by DC to post a teacher funding proposal on a Site:
</p><p>6.1	<u>General Rule</u>.  DC will only disclose a teacher's first name, email address, personal phone number, or personal address in select instances outlined below.  DC, however, will liberally disclose a teacher's title (Mr, Ms, etc), last name, school address, proposal information, and feedback compiled for funded projects.  Recipients of such information include school officials, teacher colleagues, Site visitors, donors, third party contractors, and other teachers.
</p><p>6.2	<u>Verification Of Affiliation</u>.  The contact information (name, postal address, email address and telephone number) of teachers who have indicated an affiliation with a teacher organization (e.g., RISE Network, Barksdale Reading Institute, Teach For America, New York Teaching Fellow) may be shared with the associated organization for purposes of verification that the teacher belongs to the organization (See Section 4 above). However, our agreements with the affiliated organizations only permit them to use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function and prohibits them from using it for any other purpose.  The name and postal address of teachers who have indicated an affiliation with a teacher organization may also be provided to teachers who have indicated the same affiliation-so as to enable authentication of a teacher's affiliation. 
</p><p>6.3	<u>Student Projects</u>.  DC will provide visitors to the Sites and potential donors with information regarding student projects available for funding. For project shipping and fulfillment purposes we will provide teacher name and school address information to our electronic procurement partner eSchoolMall.com ("ESM"), vendors selected by teachers using ESM (e.g., Barnes &amp; Noble for classroom materials), and other vendors and services providers selected by teachers (e.g., a local science museum for a field trip). DC is not responsible for the privacy practices of these companies. For more information regarding the handling of your information by these companies, please refer to the privacy policies of these companies.
</p><p>6.4	<u>School Officials and Teacher Colleagues</u>.  DC may provide information about a teacher (including but not restricted to name, postal address, and proposal information), project and materials supplied to a teacher in connection with a project  to principals, teacher colleagues at your school, superintendents, or other employees of local, state, or federal school systems.
</p><p>6.5	<u>Donors</u>.  DC may provide donors and Site visitors with information about a teacher, namely the teacher's title, last name, and proposals submitted by him/her.
</p><p>7.	<em>Your Right to Access and Amend Your Personal Information</em>
</p><p>You have the right to request access to the personal information that we record about you.    Your right includes the right to view such information and copy it in person, or request that a copy of it be sent to you by mail (for which we may charge you a reasonable fee to cover our costs).  Your right also includes the right to request corrections, amendments or deletions of any personal information that is in our possession.
