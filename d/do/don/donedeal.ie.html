<p>"Personal Data"<br> 		This is data that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact 		you and may include your name, email address and telephone number. 		Such information is only collected from you if you voluntarily submit 		it to us, and is only kept for as long as it is required for us to 		provide you with a high quality service.</p>
