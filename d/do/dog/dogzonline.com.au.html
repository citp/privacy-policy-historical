<p><b>Voluntarily Provided Information</b><br>
If you register for membership through our web site, make purchases from our on-line offerings, respond to a request for information or make any other on-line request of us (including email), you will be voluntarily providing personally identifiable information. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, we ask that you please do not provide the requested information.

</p><p>If you have previously provided personally identifiable information by registration through our web site, you may request to be removed from our systems.

<p><b>Links to Third-Party Web Sites</b><br>
Through our web pages, you may connect to third parties' web sites via hyperlinks, and the connections may or may not be obvious.

<p><b>Required Disclosures of Data &amp; Information</b><br>
Regardless of anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we may disclose personally identifiable information, with or without prior notice to you, when we believe that the law requires it, in response to subpoenas or at the demand of governmental agencies, to protect our systems or business, to protect other visitors to the web site, or to respond to an emergency. If you partake in, or we reasonably suspect you of partaking in any illegal activity, we may also disclose your personally identifiable information, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order. We may also make disclosures of your personally identifiable information with your affirmative consent.
</p>
<p><b>Maintenance &amp; Transmission of Data &amp; Information</b><br>
Although we use reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy of your personally identifiable data and information, due to technological limitations, and the risk of unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions and/or data, we cannot completely assure you, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable data and information, and any other electronically communicated information, will be absolutely confidential.</p>
<p>For all e-commerce transactions, we use industry-standard commercial encryption technology to protect the data and information that you transmit to us via our web site. We never keep a record anywhere of your full credit card details. (All credit card payments to this site are either processed by paypal or a bank approved payment system). </p>
<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br>
Due to changing technological and marketing demands, we reserve the right to change our policies regarding the privacy of your personally identifiable information in the future. If that happens, we will endeavor to promptly update this Privacy Policy. We may also attempt to provide a message to our members whose e-mail addresses we have, in conformity with this Privacy Policy, advising of any such change(s). Your continued use of the web site following changes to this policy will indicate that you accept the changes. </p>
