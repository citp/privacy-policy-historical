Go2Net, Inc. is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its user community. The intent of this privacy policy is to detail the information Go2Net may gather about individuals who visit its Web sites, how that information is used, and Go2Net's disclosure practices. Please note that this policy applies only to Go2Net's Web sites and not to the Web sites of other companies or organizations to which we provide links. 

**Site Usage Information**  
Go2Net gathers "site usage" information from all visitors to the Go2Net Web sites. Such data is used in the aggregate, to help determine general usage patterns and fine tune layout in order to ensure that our sites are as useful and enjoyable as possible. This "site usage" and statistical information may be made public information at Go2Net's discretion. 

Please note that Go2Net does not control all HTML served in conjunction with its sites. Go2Net sites may include content from other parties that may perform user activity tracking other than that described herein. In particular, some of our partners may use "cookies" in ways that we do not. 

**Individual User Information**  
Individually identifiable information will not be released without that individual's prior consent. Visitors are specifically asked for individually identifiable information when signing up to use certain Go2Net services, such as the Silicon Investor message boards, or the PlaySite membership option. In some instances, users may be asked for personal interest and demographic information in order to create a more customized user experience; however these fields will generally be optional. 

From time to time, Go2Net and/or its partners may wish to contact individual users regarding community news or to make promotional offers. However, such communications will only be delivered to users who have previously approved them. 

**Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under the age of 13)**  
In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with Go2Net policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT: 

  1. Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; 
  2. Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties; 
  3. Give children the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information; 
  4. Entice children with the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity.
