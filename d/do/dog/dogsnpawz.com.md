## How we use cookies

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

I use the following cookies on Dogs N Pawz:

  * Google Analytics (for tracking website traffic and user behavior).  You can read how their cookies work [here.](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage)
  * AddThis which is used for social media sharing.



Google Analytics is used to track website performance and user behavior.  It provides information on page views, referral sources, and other valuable information that helps me improve my website.  Google Analytics captures anonymous data about location, age, gender, and interests, but there isn’t any way that I can get that information and specifically identify that it is you.  Google Analytics may also capture your IP address as you look at articles on this website.  User and event data is retained for 26 months.  It is then automatically deleted.

## Links to other websites

Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.  Dogs N Pawz is not responsible for the privacy policies of other websites or the third-party applications it uses.

## Advertisements on Dogs N Pawz

## Last But Not Least!

Hopefully, the policy above adequately explains how your data is being used.  Even so, you have the right to access your personal data and know how it is being processed.  We will not transfer personal information unless we are legally obligated to do so.
