We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people search.

We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to</p>
<p>(a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,</p>
<p>(b) enforce the Company’s Terms of Use including investigation of potential violations thereof,</p>

In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.</p>
