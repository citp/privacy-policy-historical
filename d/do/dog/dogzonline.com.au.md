**Navigation** >> [Home](https://web.archive.org/web/20040604190046id_/http%3A//www.dogzonline.com.au/home.asp) >> Privacy Statement

With regards to your privacy, we have 3 commitments.

  * We will respect your privacy

  * We will not ‘sell’ your private information to anyone.

  * We will only give your information to a third party if:   


    * the law requires us to do so 
    * or, we believe it is necessary to prevent death or injury 




**Types of Information We Collect**  
Generally, you are free to browse the Dogz Online site without submitting any personal information. We do not collect any of your personal information (such as a name, address or e-mail address) when you visit the Dogz Online, unless you join up as a member, or otherwise agree to submit to us such information (eg via email). 

**Cookies**  
Dogz Online uses browser cookies to facilitate your experience with our site. These cookies are small sections of code that our server sends to your browser which it can then store on your hard drive. If you choose to accept these cookies, they enable us to recognize that your browser has previously visited and used our site, and, based on your browser's previous visits, assist us with tailoring the information and content you view. An example of the customization allowed by the use of such cookies is to retain your username and password as part of the Dogz Online membership system or forums on our site so you don't have to re-enter them each time you visit. You do not have to accept these cookies to visit or use the Dogz Online site or our products and services, and you can choose to refuse our cookie or delete our cookie from your hard drive.

**Breeder / Exhibitor Membership of this site**  
Membership of this site is open to all current members of Australia and New Zealand's Registered Canine Associations for the purpose of

  * Displaying Breeder notices (including litter notices and mature dog notices)

  * Allowing exhibitors the opportunity of displaying profiles of their dogs on the site

  * Displaying rescue dogs




Because the nature of this site is to 'advertise yourself' to the rest of the world, most of the information that you supply to us via the forms in the membership section will be readily available to all users of this site. If you are uncomfortable with this, then please do not become a member.

Because we cannot control users of this site, we cannot guarantee that your information that is readily displayed on the site (eg email addresses) will not be harvested from this site and used for the purposes of spam or other uses.

**Registration on the Dogz Online Forums**  
Dogz Online requires users who want to participate in the [forums](http://forums.dogzonline.com.au/index.php) to register. In order to register, you must provide us with a username (which does not have to be your real name), password and a valid e-mail address. This allows us to protect our community from abusive postings and provides a verifiable point of contact should legal questions arise. At any time, you have the ability to keep your e-mail address hidden from other users by selecting that option within your user profile. When you register, you have the option of providing some additional information such as interests, and homepage URL. This optional information is made available to other forum users to foster a sense of community. If you have any concerns about providing this information, simply leave the fields blank and your registration will still be processed 

**Children's privacy**  
We will take all reasonable steps to protect the safety of children in their use of Dogz Online. We ask that children under the age of 18 have a parent or guardian verify their membership application with Dogz Online. Whilst Dogz Online will make every reasonable effort to ensure that children's privacy and other rights are not compromised, it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to monitor their children's Internet usage. 

**Purchasing and/or Credit Card Information**  
Dogz Online strives to maintain strict security for your credit card information. All credit card payments are made via a secure link through a third party gateway with a direct link to the National Australia Bank. All processing is done in 'real time' mode. We do not maintain any credit card information at Dogz Online, which means that you have to provide it each time you make a purchase, but also means that your information is controlled by you alone. 

**Links to Other Sites**  
Dogz Online includes many links to other websites operated by other people and organisations. When you link to another site, the privacy and protection policies of that site apply, not those of Dogz Online.
