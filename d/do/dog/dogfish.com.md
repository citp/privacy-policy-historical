# Privacy Policy | Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales

This site is owned and operated by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, Inc. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales, we want to make your online experience satisfying and safe. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.

### Information Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales Collects and Tracks

Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales gathers two types of information about users:

  * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to ask questions or provide comments to the staff at Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales, sign up for newsletters, and/or authenticate to the website with third party identities (Open ID, Facebook).
  * Information gathered through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to customers' needs. Under no circumstances does Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.



### Children

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

### Usage Tracking and Use of Information

Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).

Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

### Cookies

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in purchasing, polling and surveys.

### Security

Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.

### Your Consent

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
