After receiving the unsubscribe request, we will delete your email address from the distribution list, thus preventing you from receiving any further newsletters or special offer e-mails from us. We use a 3rd party provider called “MailChimp” to store your subscribed email addresses along with your first and last name (if you chose to provide that information during the sign-up).
