# Privacy Policy

Society for Environmental Communications' Down To Earth (DTE) has adopted a set of information management guidelines that serve as the basis for our relationships with our friends, visitors, customers and others interested in environment, development and sustainability issues. These guidelines have been developed with the recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. If the changes represent a material departure from our current practices with respect to the use of personal information, the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to taking effect.

  **INFORMATION GATHERED AND TRACKED**

Information submitted through all feedback forms on any DTE website is stored in a database. Specifically, we store the name, e-mail address, and demographic information (address, occupation, etc) of the visitors to our website who wish to receive certain free services from DTE, including but not limited to newsletters, e-mail lists, and online discussions. We also use such information to send out occasional promotional materials, including alerts on new publications available for sale. We have clearly marked which information is optional and which is mandatory. 

  As a proactive organisation deeply involved in disseminating research on science, environment, development and sustainability such information is crucial in helping us sustain our advocacy efforts. We guarantee that personal information about users will not be provided to any third party without their consent. We perform statistical analyses of user behaviour in order to measure interest in our newsletters and other services for future content development purposes.

  **E-MAIL**

Using the e-mail addresses provided at registration, we construct mailing lists used for regular newsletters and occasional promotional e-mails. We may contact users regarding account status, changes to the subscriber agreement, and to confirm registration via e-mail. The e-mail addresses that users supply to use this service will not be used for any other purpose without their consent.

  Addresses provided by registered users may occasionally be used for sending promotional materials regarding DTE activities. In addition, the address and other contact details of experts working in various fields are also used in specialised contact directories published by DTE, but only with the express consent of those included in such directories.

**DATA SECURITY**

To prevent unauthorised access and to maintain data accuracy, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online.

  **OPTING-OUT, CORRECTIONS AND CANCELLATIONS**

Upon request, we will immediately a) Remove user information from our database thereby cancelling that user's registration; b) Correct personal information that a user states is erroneous; or c) Permit a user to "opt out" of further e-mail contact, while still allowing access to the site. To request a correction or cancellation please send us an e-mail addressed to: [dte@cseindia.org](mailto:dte@cseindia.org) with ' **Un-subscribe** ' in the subject.

  **COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL PROCESS**

We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorised use of our online resources; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).

  **RESERVATION**

Down To Earth (DTE) reserves the right to change our policy at any time in order to address new issues and reflect changes on our site. By using these services after we post changes, you indicate your acceptance to those changes.
