#### **Cookies and other technologies**

When you use our sites (including mobile sites or mobile apps), we and third party organisations may collect information by using 'cookies' and other technologies (for simplicity we refer to all such technologies as ‘cookies’). For a list of the companies which use cookies and how they use them please access our Cookie Consent Tool. This is always available at the bottom corner of our sites.  By continuing to use this site, when you create an account or when you buy/sell tickets, you agree to us and third party organisations using cookies in line with your cookie settings. You can use the Cookie Consent Tool to change your preferences at any time. For information about how your personal information is used please see our Privacy Policy.

#### **What are cookies and how do they work?**

Cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to your computer or other device when you visit a website. Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognise you and can then tailor what you see on the screen.

#### **What do we use cookies for?**

Our Cookie Consent Tool tells you which companies use which type of cookies. We have summarised the cookie types into the following three categories:

  1. **1.      To provide you with the service you have asked for (Essential cookies)**



For example keeping you logged in during your visit. Without cookies the site might forget you and you'd have to constantly log back in. When you buy tickets, cookies make sure they’re still in your shopping basket when you get to the checkout.

  1. **2.      To show adverts that are more relevant to your interests (Advertising cookies)**



For example we and third party organisations may use cookies to restrict the number of times you see the same advert or to show other adverts that may be more relevant to you - often called online behavioural advertising (OBA). OBA is a way of using information about your web-browsing activity, collected by using cookies, to group you with other users into interest groups and show you advertisements based on those interests.

  1. **3.      To analyse and improve your browsing experience (Analytics & Customisation cookies)**



For example, for analysis purposes, we like to know what pages and links are popular and which ones don't get used so much to help us keep our sites relevant and up to date. We also use them to customise your visits to the site, for example to remember choices you make such as your language or region.

#### **Using browser settings to manage cookies**

In addition to our Cookie Consent Tool, most browsers will enable you to manage your cookies preferences e.g. have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or use it to disable cookies altogether. If you do decide to disable or delete them altogether some sites won’t work as well as they rely on cookies to provide you with the service you have requested (see _Essential cookies_ above)
