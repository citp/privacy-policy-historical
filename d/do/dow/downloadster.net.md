## 1\. Collection of Information.

### 1.1 Survey Information.

Dowloadster.net collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an Dowloadster.net survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Dowloadster.net or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Dowloadster.net, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Dowloadster.net may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Dowloadster.net or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Dowloadster.net or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Dowloadster.net.

### 1.2 Third Party List Information.

Dowloadster.net collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and Dowloadster.net subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, Dowloadster.net seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Dowloadster.net and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.

### 1.3 Other Information.

Other occasions when Dowloadster.net obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Dowloadster.net or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Dowloadster.net's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Dowloadster.net service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").

### 1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.

Dowloadster.net currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Dowloadster.net may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").

**(a) Cookies.** A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Dowloadster.net to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Dowloadster.net's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Website.

**(b) Web Beacons.** A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function, see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Dowloadster.net to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Dowloadster.net might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Dowloadster.net's database, visits the fishing website, Dowloadster.net receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and Dowloadster.net would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball. Dowloadster.net may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Dowloadster.net also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Dowloadster.net's database.

**(c) New Technology.** The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Dowloadster.net's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Dowloadster.net strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.

### 1.5 Outside Information.

Dowloadster.net will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Dowloadster.net obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Dowloadster.net has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties. Dowloadster.net has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").

### 1.8 Log File Information.

### 1.9 Credit Card Information.

Dowloadster.net may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Dowloadster.net. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Dowloadster.net, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.
