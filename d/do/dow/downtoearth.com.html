    </ul>
    <p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States. <br>
      <br>
        <strong>Aggregated and non-personal information</strong><br>
    We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our IAC sister companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising. </p>
    <p><strong>Third-party websites</strong> <br>
      There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting. </p>
    <p><strong>How you can access your information</strong> <br>
      If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into <a href="default.aspx">profile page</a> and clicking on your account settings.

      If you have an online account with us, you also may choose to resign and close your account at any time by sending your resignation request to <a href="mailto:support@DownToEarth.com">support@DownToEarth.com</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new, separate account at any time or re-activate your previous account by following instructions we will give you at the time you close your account. If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our web site or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies. </p>

    <ul type="disc">
      <li>You      can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result      in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such      information may be required in order for you to register as a member;      purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion,      survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on      our website.</li>

Please note that changing information in      your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email      communications will only affect future activities or communications from      us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as      a service provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated      your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with      that third party.</li>
      <li>You      may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or      the IAC family of companies for direct marketing purposes by checking the      appropriate opt-out selection at the time you register on our site, or by sending      your opt-out request to <a href="mailto:support@DownToEarth.com">support@DownToEarth.com</a> after you have registered.</li>

In those places where we ask for your phone number, we will always tell you how your phone number will be used � either to provide you a service you requested from us or to call you to inform you about one of our products in which you have expressed an interest. We will not call you for marketing purposes unless you provide us your phone number specifically to receive such calls. If you have previously provided us your phone number but no longer wish to be contacted by phone by us, you can send your request to <a href="mailto:support@DownToEarth.com">support@DownToEarth.com</a> . Under our Do Not Call policy you may instruct us not to call you for marketing purposes by informing anyone who contacts you by phone in our behalf that you do not wish to receive marketing calls from us. You can also instruct us at any time not to call you for marketing purposes by sending your request to <a href="mailto:support@DownToEarth.com">support@DownToEarth.com</a>]. We will implement your instructions as soon as possible, and in no event later 30 days after receiving your instructions. We have policies and procedures in place and train our employees to honor your request. Please note that we may still need to call you for servicing or other non-marketing purposes. </li>

    <p><strong><a name="security" id="security"></a>How we protect your personal information</strong> <br>
      We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use SSL encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. <br>
      We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft. </p>
    <p><strong>Information you provide about yourself while using our service</strong> <br>
      We provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our <a href="http://www.downtoearth/help/terms.aspx">Terms of Use</a>. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. </p>
    <p><strong>Children's privacy</strong> <br>
      Although our website is a general audience site, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18. </p>
