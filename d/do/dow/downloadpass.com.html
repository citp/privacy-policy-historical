            with respect to information or data gathered regarding subscribers 
            and members of this Site. This is an adult Site that expressly and 
            strictly limits its membership to adults. All persons under the age 
            of 18 are strictly prohibited from accessing or viewing the contents 
            of this Site.</p>
          <p>This Site does not knowingly seek or collect any personal information 
            or data from persons under the age of 18.</p>
          <p>Notice - Use of Website by the Subscriber Constitutes the Subscriber's 
            Express Assent to the Use of Personal Information Collected by Site.</p>
          <p>CAREFULLY READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT BECAUSE BY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION 
            TO AND USE OF THIS SITE YOU WILL BE EXPRESSLY SIGNIFYING THAT YOU 
            AGREE TO THIS POLICY STATEMENT AND THAT YOU ASSENT TO THE USE OF ANY 
            PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU SUPPLY OR THAT IS COLLECTED ABOUT YOU 
            AS DETAILED IN THIS POLICY STATEMENT.</p>
          <p>IF YOU DO NOT EXPRESSLY AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY 
            POLICY STATEMENT YOU SHOULD NOT SUBSCRIBE TO OR USE THIS SITE.<b><u></u></b></p>
          <p><b><u>What Information About Subscribers is Collected?<br>
            </u></b>When any adult consumer signs-on as a member or subscriber 
            of this Site that consumer will be required to provide certain personal 
            as well as demographic information which may include, but is not necessarily 
            limited to, the subscriber's name, address, e-mail address, username and password, 
            and special interests or affiliations. This Site collects any and 
            all such information and includes it in its customer database.</p>
          <p>If the Site features or conducts any special events, special promotions 
            or offers, contests or polls, a subscriber of the Site may be asked 
            to provide information in order to participate, if the subscriber 
            voluntarily provides that information, all such information may be 
            collected by the Site and included in its customer database. </p>
          <p>When a subscriber of this Site requests web pages from the Site's 
            server or clicks on banners or other hypertext links, the Site will 
            automatically collect some information or data about the subscriber, 
            including the subscriber's IP address, the information that is collected 
            may also indicate any special preferences or requests of the subscriber; 
            all that information and data will be collected by the Site and included 
            in its customer database.</p>
          <p>If a subscriber sends any personal communication or correspondence, 
            by any means, to the Site, or any of its employees, agents or representatives, 
            the Site may collect any information regarding that communication 
            and include that information in its customer database.</p>
          <p><b><u>Use of Personal Subscriber Information.<br>
            </u></b>Except for Subscribers who: (a) voluntarily register as an 
            advertiser with the Site or, (b) provide a specific query or comment 
            to the Site through the “contact us” link on the Site, 
            the Site will not obtain, collect, copy, use, transfer, sell nor save 
            any unique, personal or identifying information from any Subscribers 
            that visit the Site and/or any Affiliate Sites (collectively, the 
            “Prohibited Data”). Without limiting the foregoing, the 
            Site may collect, use and store (but only in its own data facility), 
            for no more than thirty (30) days, the IP address (i.e., the octet) 
            of a Subscriber who accesses the Site, solely for the limited purpose 
            of detecting “click fraud” (i.e., an automated method 
            of linking to, or access of, the Site for the purpose of inflating 
            the number of page views of the Site) and for no other reason; provided 
            that, instead of collecting, using and storing the IP address (i.e., 
            the octet) of a Subscriber who accesses the Site, the Site will “hash” 
            or convert each IP address into a mathematical representation of the 
            IP address which the Site may collect, use and store without limitation. 
            For the avoidance of doubt, the Site will destroy each IP address 
            (and any data containing such IP address) no later than thirty (30) 
            days after the date the Site collected that IP address.] The Site 
            will not use "cookie" or similar technology (e.g., clear 
            gifs) on the Site for any purpose at any time; provided that the Site 
            may display clear gif banner ads in connection with queries prohibited 
            under this Agreement (e.g., illegal or “blacklisted” queries).</p>
          <p><b><u>Security of Personal Information Collected by the Site.<br>
            </u></b>Consistent with the Policies set forth in this Privacy Statement, 
            the Site has adopted and implemented reasonable and technologically 
            feasible procedures for maintaining the security, accuracy and integrity 
            of all personal information relating to subscribers that is collected 
            by the Site.</p>
          <p>All subscribers should consider any information provided to or collected 
            by the Site as <b>non-confidential</b>, and consequently the Site 
            assumes no liability or responsibility if any information relating 
            to any subscriber is intercepted and/or used by an unintended recipient.<b><u></u></b></p>
          <p><b><u>"OPT-IN" and "OPT-OUT" Provisions.<br>
            </u></b>There may be occasions when a subscriber will be presented 
            with special offers either from the operators of the Site or from 
            third-party service or content providers, which may include consent 
            to receive e-mail solicitations, communications, newsletters, commercial 
            advertising, or other promotional or special event materials (collectively 
            referred to as "Offers").</p>
          <p>"OPT-IN" -- Some Offers may be presented to the subscriber 
            with the option to express the subscriber's preference by either clicking 
            or entering "accept" (alternatively "yes") or 
            "decline" (alternatively "no"). By selecting or 
            clicking the "accept" or "yes" the subscriber 
            indicates that the subscriber "OPTS-IN" to that Offer and 
            thereby agrees and assents that the subscriber's personal information 
            and data may be disclosed to third-parties.</p>
          <p>"OPT-OUT" -- Other Offers may be presented with a pre-selected 
            preference or choice. If the subscriber does not deselect the pre-selected 
            preference of choice (i.e. "OPT-OUT" of the Offer) then 
            the Site may transfer the subscriber's personal profile information 
            to the third-party service or content provider making the Offer. If 
            the subscriber deselects the pre-selected preference then no personal 
            information about the subscriber may be disclosed to any third-party 
            service or content provider.</p>
          <p><b><u>"OPT-OUT" Revocation Procedure.<br>
            </u></b>The Site also offers all subscribers a procedure for "Opting-Out" 
            if the subscriber subsequently chooses to revoke any consent to receive 
            Offers by emailing <img src="cimages/misc/privacyeml.gif" style="display:inline;margin: 0;padding: 0;" width="163" height="13" border="0">, 
            and entering in the exact email address to be "Opted-Out".</p>
          <p><b><u>Terms and Conditions of Membership.<br>
            </u></b>Each subscriber should carefully read each of the terms and 
            conditions of Membership of this Site. By accepting membership to 
            this Site you are unconditionally accepting all of those terms and 
            conditions. Some of those terms and conditions may also affect the 
            right of this Site to use information that it has gathered from subscribers. 
          </p>
          <p>In the event of any conflicts between the Membership Terms and Conditions 
            and this Privacy Policy Statement, the provisions of this Privacy 
            Policy shall control. </p></td>
