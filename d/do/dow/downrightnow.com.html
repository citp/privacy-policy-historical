<p>
This privacy policy sets out how <span class="siteName">downrightnow</span> uses and protects any information that you provide when you use this web site.
</p>
<p>
<span class="siteName">downrightnow</span> is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this web site, you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>
<strong>Non-personal data (NPD)</strong> is information that is in no way personally identifiable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal data (PD)</strong> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. PD is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, PD is broader in scope and covers more data.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>Visitor</strong> is someone who merely browses our website.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
Generally, you control the amount and type of information that you provide to us when using our website. Our legal basis for collecting and processing your personal data (PD) is based on consent.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What Happens if you Don't Give Us Your Personal Data (PD)?</strong> If you do not provide us with enough PD, we may not be able to provide you with all our services and functionality. However, you can access and use most parts of our website without giving us your PD.
</p>

<h2>We Collect Your PD in the Following Ways</h2>
<p>
<strong>Automatic Information</strong>. We automatically receive information from your web browser or mobile device. This information includes the name of the website from which you entered our website, if any, as well as the name of the website you'll visit when you leave our website. This information also includes the IP address of your computer/the proxy server you use to access the Internet, your Internet service provider's name, your web browser type, the type of mobile device, your computer operating system, and data about your browsing activity when using our website. We use all this information to analyze trends among our users to help improve our website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When Entering and Using Our Website</strong>. When you enter and use our website and agree to accept cookies, some of these cookies may contain your PD.
</p>

<h4>Log Files</h4>
<p>
Like other web sites, <span class="siteName">downrightnow</span> makes use of server log files. The information inside the log files includes Internet Protocol (IP) address, web browser type, date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks and is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement around the site, and gather demographic information.
</p>

<h4>Optional Status Reports</h4>
<p>
If you choose to submit a status report on <span class="siteName">downrightnow</span>, we collect the date/time stamp, the service status you indicate, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. Submitted status reports are recorded in a cookie to help discourage repeat submissions in a 24-hour period.
</p>

<h4>Optional Contact Form Submissions</h4>
<p>
If you choose to send us a message using our <a href="/contact">contact page</a>, we collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address and any other information you choose to provide with your message, such as your name and email address.
</p>

<strong>Google Analytics Privacy notice</strong>. Our website uses Google Analytics to collect information about the use of our website. Google Analytics collects information from users such as age, gender, interests, demographics, how often they visit our website, what pages they visit, and what other websites they have used before coming to our website.

We do not combine the information collected using Google Analytics with PD.

<strong>Google Remarketing</strong>. Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I've viewed? Our website uses a remarketing advertising service. Our remarketing service is provided by Google and other companies that show our ads on websites across the Internet. With remarketing you may see ads for our products you have previously looked at. As an example, suppose you visit a website that sells computers, but you do not buy a computer on your first visit to that website. The website's owner might like to encourage you to revisit his/her site and buy a computer by showing you his/her ads again on other websites that you visit. We use remarketing for similar purposes. For this to happen, Google will read a cookie that is already in your browser, or they place a cookie in your browser when you visit our site or other sites using remarketing.

<p>
You can opt out of Google's use of cookies and remarketing at this link: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en</a>

You can opt out of Google's personalized advertising by visiting Google's Ad Settings page at this link: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com/</a>
