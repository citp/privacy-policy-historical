    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Privacy Statement</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">DoItYourself.com has created this privacy statement in
    order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our
    information gathering and dissemination practices. Questions regarding this
    statement should be directed to the Webmaster by emailing <a href="mailto:webmaster@DoItYourself.com"> webmaster@DoItYourself.com</a>
    .</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Privacy Policy</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">DoItYourself.com (sometimes "us",
    "our", "we") is a leading provider of home improvement
    and repair information and advice on the Internet and e-commerce solutions
    for individuals and businesses. We invite you to explore our Web site and
    find out what all the talk is about.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Information this Site
    Gathers/Tracks</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">Our web site logs IP addresses and browser types, but
    we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means
    that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">You can browse our site without entering any personal
    information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit. However, we
    hope that all of our visitors will register with us so that we can learn
    more about our valuable customers. Our registration form asks users for name, email address,
    preferences, and various types of demographic information. We encourage all visitors to register with
    us in our Community Forum.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">We maintain a separate list of email address which we
    use to send you our newsletter containing
    news about the subjects you and fellow readers have asked us about. If you
    would rather not receive the newsletter, but would still like to register,
    you may register in our forums, but not in our newsletter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Preferences and demographic information are used to
    help us improve our service and products. The more we know about you, the
    better we can serve you. Visitors may choose to voluntarily "Sign
    In", or request our Free online newsletter, use the Tell a Friend
    feature, complete a Visitor Survey, enter our contests, or request
    information from us. If so, we may on our own behalf send you Email, copies
    of our Free newsletters or surveys. (We will delete your Email address on
    request.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The only other place that we collect personal
    information on our Web site is on the order forms, which ask for billing
    information such as name, postal address, email address and credit card
    number should you decide to place an order online.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Use of the Information this
    Site Gathers/Tracks</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">Our Website logs IP addresses for systems
    administration purposes and these logs are analyzed to constantly improve
    the value of the materials available on the website.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Surveys and Relationships</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">Our online surveys ask visitors for contact
    information (like their email address) and demographic information (like
    their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys
    to send the user information about our company. Demographic and profile data
    is also collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers
    on an aggregate basis.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The Company maintains special relationships, such as
    our email service "Powered by CommTouch" with various strategic partners, business
    partners, and operates several co-branded sites. The operators of the
    co-branded sites may gather additional information; the Company sometimes
    has access to some or all of the information, and the Company's partner's
    use of the information is not within the Company's control.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699"> Bulletin Boards</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">Our Community Bulletin Boards allow users to post
    without registering. We ask visitors to register so we can track the
    quantity of questions and answers, and to recognize longer standing with
    member status instead of visitor or apprentice. We also have a number of volunteer
    forum moderators. The information posted therein is therefore not in our
    control. For those visitors who do register, they have the ability to edit
    their posts after posting, receive an email when a question is answered.
    These are optional, and are selected by each member individually.
    Registrants on the Forum do not get newsletters unless they subscribe as
    well.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Order Form</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">The information that we require on our order form is
    only used to process your orders quickly and accurately. Your contact
    information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and
    your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product.
    This information may be used for marketing purposes by us. The customer's
    contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary.
    Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Sharing of the Information
    this Site Gathers/Tracks</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">For those visitors who register with us, we may share
    your name, email address, preferences, and demographic information with
    select partners so they can present you with special offers. Though, as
    mentioned above, you may tell us that you don't want your information
    shared, in which case we will of course respect your wishes. Please see the
    Opt-out section below. The information that you submit on the order form
    (contact and billing information) is never shared with any third parties,
    including our partners.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Security</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">When you place an order online, your personal
    information and credit card information are scrambled using encryption
    technology before being sent over the Internet. This makes it virtually
    impossible for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being
    transferred through cyberspace. When we receive your order, it is kept
    encrypted until we're ready to process it. In addition, we erase your credit
    card information from our web site database so it isn't connected to the
    Internet, and is therefore safe from "hackers."</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Links and Linked Sites</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">Our website contains links which may including framing
    in of pages from other Web sites we have selected. We also maintain a
    database where visitors can post Community Links&nbsp; This area includes a
    visitor rating system.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"> Please
    be aware that our privacy policy does not apply to these linked sites. We
    encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with
    any Web site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Cookies</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">Our site uses cookies to keep track of items in a
    shopping cart and to provide our visitors with a tailored user experience.
    With the help of cookies, we can present customized content and ads
    that will be of more interest. We also use cookies in our Community Forums
    to remember members passwords so they don't have to re-enter them each
    time they visit the site. You have the option of setting your browser to
    reject cookies. However, if certain cookies that track your purchase are
    rejected then we won't be able to keep items in your cart.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Advertiser Cookies</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">You may be served cookies from our advertisers or
    advertising agencies while visiting our site. We do not control, nor do we
    have access to any of the information they may collect.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Opt-out Policy, Correcting and
    Updating</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">If at any time after registering, you change your mind
    about receiving the newsletter or sharing your information with third
    parties, you may visit the site and unsubscribe automatically from the link
    on every content page. You may also use this feature to delete an old
    address or add a new one.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">General Advice</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">Finally, although Advice Company has a very strong
    Privacy Protection policy on our end, and does its utmost to protect privacy
    of all visitors, we bear no responsibility for anyone else's conduct with
    respect to material you transmit. As is true with ANY Internet usage and
    access to ANY Website, if you are using someone else's computer, or someone
    else has access to your computer, or you are using a corporate or other

    the "network" operator to retrieve copies of Email you sent from
    the computer and/or to trace the places you have been visiting on the
    Internet.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" color="#006699">Amendments </font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial">We may amend this Privacy Policy on a prospective
    basis (i.e., for future visits) at any time by posting a revised policy on
    our Web site. Further, nothing in this Privacy Policy is designed to protect
    the privacy of visitors whose use of the Company's Website is, in our
