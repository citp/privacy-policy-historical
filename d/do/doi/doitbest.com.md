Do it Best understands that our customers are concerned about privacy online. This policy is intended to help you understand how Do it Best Commerce Company, LLC and its affiliates ("Do it Best," "we," or "us") collect, use and safeguard the information you provide on our website.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use or disclosure of information that is collected or obtained by us through means other than this website.

### **PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION**

If you browse our website, you may generally do so anonymously without providing any personal information.  However, there are cases where we collect personal data – you will know this data is being collected because you will have to provide it such as by filling out a form.  We collect personally identifiable and transactional information when you: (1) purchase products or services from the site (2) register for an account, (3) request to receive additional information regarding products and services, or (4) send us a question. If you choose not to give information we request, you can still visit most of our website, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services.  We may combine the information you submit under your account with other information that we may receive from you, from third parties, or with other public demographic information.

In case you change your mind or wish to update or delete your personal information, we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us.  You can do this by contacting Customer Care using the contact information specified below.

###  **PRODUCT ORDERS**

When you place an order for a product, we need to know your contact information, shipping information, e-mail address and payment card information (such as payment card name, card number, CVV and expiration date).   This information is required so that payment can be authorized by a third party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) that we have retained to process payments made via the site. All payment card information is provided directly to the Payment Processor and not to Do it Best (i.e., we do not receive or store your credit card information in connection with payments authorized through the site). All Internet transactions with the Payment Processor are performed on a server that uses industry standard encryption technology to protect your payment card information from being obtained by unauthorized third parties. Use of your payment and transaction information will be subject to the privacy policies of the Payment Processor and your credit card issuer. We are not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor or for any security breaches suffered by such entity. In connection with your use of the site, Do it Best may obtain certain payment transaction details from the Payment Processor, which we will use solely in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  We also use your order information to fulfill your order and send an order or shipping confirmation, as well as notify you of your order status.

### **MARKETING MESSAGES**

When you purchase products online from us, request product information or otherwise provide us with personal information, we may automatically place you on a list to receive promotional mailings and e-mails regarding special offers from Do it Best, its affiliates and the Do it Best member with whom you have placed your order. If you do not wish to receive these messages, you can simply utilize the opt-out method detailed in the message, respond to any email by telling us that you do not want to receive any future communications, or contact Customer Care using the contact information specified below. You may not opt-out of receiving essential updates regarding your account.

### **Conversion Tracking**

Search engines offer a feature called “conversion tracking” which is a way to track clicks to sales from either search results or ads on search engines.
