Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining
our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is
collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on every page of our site.
<p>
<b>The Way We Use Information</b>
</p><p>
We use email addresses to confirm registration upon the creation of a new account.
</p><p>
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other
purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
</p><p>
On occasion we may send email to addresses of registered users to inform them about changes or new features added to our site.
</p><p>
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.
For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or
that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything
that could be used to identify those individuals.
</p><p>
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated
to the ones described above.
</p><p>
<b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b>
</p><p>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put
in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information
we collect online.
</p><p>
<b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b>
</p><p>
DNSBL.info expects its partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users.
However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible
through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during
your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a DNSBL.info page, certain content that
is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through DNSBL.info you may be introduced to, or be able
to access, information, Web sites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.
DNSBL.info is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the
applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated
by a third party.
</p><p>
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other
technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example,
some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to
determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features available on our site,
third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. DNSBL.info does not control the
use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of
such third parties.
</p><p>
Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on our site, such as in message boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you
post, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our
knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities
are beyond the control of DNSBL.info and this policy.
</p><p>
We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org.
</p><p>
<b>Changes to this policy</b>
</p><p>
DNSBL.info reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that
applied at the time the information was collected.
