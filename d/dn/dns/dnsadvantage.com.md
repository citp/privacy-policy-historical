### Transparency and Choice; Privacy Choices

##### Cookies

  * You can opt-out of the use of [AdAdvisor Cookies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy#cookies) and [AK Cookies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/privacy-policy#cookies) for Neustar Marketing Services on the [Privacy Choices page](https://web.archive.org/privacy/opt-out) of our website.
  * You can also opt-out of the use of AdAdvisor Cookies and AK Cookies for Neustar Marketing Services by using the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) tool on the <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> page.
  * You can opt-out of interest-based advertising served by companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Choice tool by visiting <http://aboutads.info/choices>.



##### Mobile Advertising IDs

  * Apple’s iOS IDFA can be reset by the user at any time. Users can opt out of all remarketing by enabling a device setting called "Limit Ad Tracking" (LAT), which restricts advertisers from using the IDFA for behavioral advertising. You can learn how to limit ad tracking on your iOS device or to reset your IDFA here: [IDFA Opt-Out](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228).
  * Similar to IDFA for Apple devices, Android devices pass Google Advertising ID, which provides the same type of device-specific, unique, resettable ID for advertising as Apple IDFA or IFA. You can learn more about how identifiers on mobile are used for advertising and receive instruction for how to opt out of mobile advertising on the [Google Privacy & Terms](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/) webpage.



Please note that opting out does not mean you will block online advertising altogether or see fewer ads. It simply means that the ads that you see will not be personalized for you. Ads may be served because they relate to the website you are visiting or to your current search, or they may just be randomly placed.

Your choice to opt-out from the use of AK and AdAdvisor cookies will not affect ads placed by any other organization.

We comply with privacy choice requests by placing an “opt-out cookie” on your computer or device. Consequently, if you clear your cookies on that computer or device, we will not be able to read our “opt-out cookie” and will resume collecting information from that computer or device for purposes of retargeting. Similarly, a privacy choice request will not be effective on other browsers, computers, or devices you may use if you have not opted out while using that browser, computer, or device.

### Accountability

Neustar is a member of the [Network Advertising Initiative](https://www.networkadvertising.org/) (“NAI”) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) (“DAA”) and adheres to each organization’s Codes and Principles.
