We will not otherwise disclose customer personal and account information unless we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of Bananic, our customers, or others, or where Bananic has good belief that the law requires such disclosure. 

Neither will Bananic, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that Bananic stores or transmits for its customers.

3\. It is required to cooperate with interception orders, warrants or other legal processes that Bananic determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; and
