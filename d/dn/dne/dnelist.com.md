AFFILIATE
Information Collection and Use
Unsubscribe request emails collected on your behalf will be owned by the merchant responsible

phone number and fax number.

           registration process will be in effect. Your information is owned by the merchant to
           whose account you are registering. You will never be contacted by DNEList.com or any
           affiliated organization for marketing purposes.
          If you are registering thru DNEList to gain access to multiple merchant suppression lists,
           your contact information will be accessible to all merchants that you apply to. Therefore,

           this privacy statement.

CONSUMER:
Information Collection and Use
You are electing to unsubscribe from a list owned and managed by one of our merchant clients
that license our service to be CAN-SPAM compliant. For our internal reporting & auditing
procedures, while you are opting out, we collect the following information:
   Email address,
   Date/time of opt out request
   Opt out link clicked to arrive at this page
   IP address used when opting out
1) DNEList does not use cookies or any other type tracking in any way on this website.
2) To remain CAN-SPAM compliant these merchants will need to distribute your email address to
    their third party affiliate partners to ensure that you no longer receive unwanted email
    messages from this specific advertiser.
    a) Your email address will not be shared or distributed to/with any other merchant accounts
          for any reason, including, but not limited opting out of their suppression lists (i.e.,
          although DNEList has many clients, you will only be opting out of this advertiser’s list(s))
          and inclusion in their opt in mailing lists—which would be in violation of the CAN-SPAM
          act. Furthermore, you will receive no communications from DNEList.com
    b) To remain CAN-SPAM compliant a merchant has up to 10 days to have opt requests
          honored across their entire affiliate base, therefore, you could potentially receive
          subsequent email messages sponsored by this advertiser within the next 10 days.
3) DNEList is a service provided to internet marketers to aid them in their CAN-SPAM
    compliance initiatives. We by no means take responsibility for their compliance in terms of
    managing and monitoring their suppression files and/or their affiliate’s use of them.
4) A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.
    We use cookies on this site to track only those merchant accounts that registered for our
    service from a 3rd party partner. None of the information collected by DNEList during the opt
    out process is stored in a cookie.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
1) DNEList.com currently partners with LashBack, Inc to provide high-level reputation
    management services to the merchants using our services. When a consumer opts out, we
    will provide LashBack such information as the list(s) they are opting out from and which
    affiliate generated the opt out request.
    a) LashBack is prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other
          purpose.

    and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with
