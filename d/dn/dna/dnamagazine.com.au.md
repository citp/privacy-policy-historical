For automated taxes we send the value of goods in the cart, the value of shipping, and the destination address to TaxJar.

Stats logs — containing visitor IP addresses and WordPress.com usernames (if available) — are retained by Automattic for 28 days and are used for the sole purpose of powering this feature.
  * **Activity Tracked:** Post and page views, video plays (if videos are hosted by WordPress.com), outbound link clicks, referring URLs and search engine terms, and country. When this module is enabled, Jetpack also tracks performance on each page load that includes the Javascript file used for tracking stats. This is exclusively for aggregate performance tracking across Jetpack sites in order to make sure that our plugin and code is not causing performance issues. This includes the tracking of page load times and resource loading duration (image files, Javascript files, CSS files, etc.). The site owner has the ability to force this feature to honour DNT settings of visitors. By default, DNT is currently not honoured.



**Data retention**

We will keep personal data only for as long as we need it to maintain our relationship with our contacts, provide them with the products, services or information they have requested, to inform our research into the preferences of our customers /clients, to comply with the law, and to ensure we do not communicate with individuals that have asked us not to. When we no longer need the information, we will dispose of it securely, using specialist companies to do this work for us if necessary. Further details can be found in our Retention Policy which is available on request.

**How we treat personal information that is also sensitive information**

Sensitive information is a sub-set of personal information that is given a higher level of protection under the Australian Privacy Principles.  **Sensitive information**  means information relating to your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional associations or memberships, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, sexual practices or sex life, criminal records, health information or biometric information.

Provided you consent, your sensitive information may only be used and disclosed for purposes relating to the primary purpose for which the sensitive information was collected.

Sensitive information may also be used or disclosed if required or authorised by law.

**Our responsibilities as a ‘controller’ under the GDPR**

Controllers are defined by the GDPR as natural or legal persons, a public authority, agency or other body to which personal information or personal data has been disclosed, whether via a third party or not, and who determines the purposes and means of processing personal information. We are a controller under the GDPR as we collect, use and store your personal information to enable us to provide you with our goods and/or services.

As a controller, we have certain obligations under the GDPR when collecting, storing and using the personal information of EU citizens. If you are an EU citizen, your personal data will:

  * be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner by us;
  * only be collected for the specific purposes we have identified in the ‘collection and use of personal information’ clause above and personal information will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with the purposes we have identified;
  * be collected in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose for which the personal information is processed;
  * be kept up to date, where it is possible and within our control to do so (please let us know if you would like us to correct any of your personal information);
  * be kept in a form which permits us to identify you, but only for so long as necessary for the purposes for which the personal data was collected;
  * be processed securely and in a way that protects against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.



We also apply these principles to the way we collect, store and use the personal information of our Australian customers or clients.

Specifically, we have the following measures in place, in accordance with the GDPR:

  * **Data protection policies:** We have internal policies in place which set out where and how we collect personal information, how it is stored and where it goes after we get it, in order to protect your personal information.
  * **Right to ask us to erase your personal information:** You may ask us to erase personal information we hold about you.
  * **Right to ask us to restrict data processing:** You may ask us to limit the processing of your personal information where you believe that the personal information we hold about you is wrong (to give us enough time to verify if the information needs to be changed), or where processing data is unlawful and you request us to restrict the processing of personal information rather than it being erased.
  * **Notification of data breaches:** We will comply with the GDPR in respect of any data breach.



**Our responsibilities as a ‘processor’ under the GDPR**

Where we are a processor, we have contracts containing certain prescribed terms in our contracts with controllers. Depending on circumstances, we can be a controller or processor or controller and processor. In addition to:

  * our contractual obligations with controllers (where we are solely a processor); and
  * our legal obligations under the GDPR as a controller (where we are both a controller and processor) as a processor we also have the following responsibilities under the GDPR: 
    * not to use a sub-processor without the prior written authorisation of the data controller;
    * to co-operate with supervisory authorities;
    * to ensure the security of its processing;
    * to keep records of processing activities;
    * to notify any personal data breaches to the data controller; and
    * to employ a data protection officer and appoint (in writing) a representative within the European Union if required by the GDPR. (These are not required for the company at the present time).



**Your rights and controlling your personal information**

We will provide this information in an easily readable machine format of our choosing. A reasonable fee may be charged when a request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive. This fee will be based on the administrative cost of providing the information. We may refuse to grant excessive, unfounded or repetitive requests, in which case, we will explain why we are refusing to comply and inform you of your right to appeal to our supervisory authority. You may request that we erase the personal information we hold about you at any time. You may also request that we transfer this personal information to another third party (data portability).

We cannot guarantee the security of any information that is transmitted to or by us over the Internet. The transmission and exchange of information is carried out at your own risk.
