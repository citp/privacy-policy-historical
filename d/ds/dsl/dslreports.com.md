We have enabled the Google Analytics Advertising Feature: "Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting". This collects data via Google Advertising cookies ([more at this google page](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/)) and anonymous identifiers ([more at this google page](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-identifier)) in addition to data collected through the standard Google Analytics implementation.

We do not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising product or feature unless we have robust notice of, and the user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.

Should you choose to, you can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking by using this broswer add-on here: [tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/)

Advertising networks such as Google Adsense, and others at our discretion, may also send cookies to your system.
