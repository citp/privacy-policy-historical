**Active Information Collected**  
Like many sites, this site actively collects information from its visitors by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail, feedback forms, and/or chat rooms. Some of the information that you submit may be personaly identifiable information (that is, information that can be uniquely identified as you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone number and so on). 

Some areas of this site may require you to submit information in order for you to benefit from specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as competitions or other promotions). You will be informed at each information point what information is required and what information is optional. 

**Passive Information Collected**  
As you navigate through a Web site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, garnered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as navigational data collection. 

This site may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular users computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report and aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting with our site, and administer and improve the site.

If you provide personally identifiable information to this site, we may combine such information with other actively collected information unless we specify otherwise at the point of collection. We will take reasonable measures to prevent personally identifiable information from being combined with passively collected information, unless you consent otherwise. We may disclose your personally identifiable information to other DStv affiliates that agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may disclose third parties, located in South Africa and/or any other country, but only: to contractors we use to support our business (e.g.: fulfilment services, technical support, delivery services, and financial institutions) in which case we will require such third parties to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of this site to which the information relates, in which case we require any such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy, or where applicable by law, court orders or government regulations. In addition, we will make full use of all information acquired through this site that is not in personally identifiable form.
