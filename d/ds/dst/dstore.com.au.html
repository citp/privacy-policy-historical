	<h1>dstore.com Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy sets out the approach which dstore will take in relation to the treatment of Personal Information. It includes information on how dstore collects, uses, discloses and keeps secure, individuals' Personal Information. It also covers how dstore makes the Personal Information it holds available for access to and correction by the individual. </p>
<p>This policy has been drafted having regard to dstore's obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (including the new National Privacy Principles) (the Privacy Act). <br>This Policy is a public document and has been prepared in light of National Privacy Principle 5, Openness. </p>
<h3><strong>1. Collection</strong></h3>
<p>1.1 dstore will only collect Personal Information where the information is necessary for dstore to perform one or more of its functions or activities. In this context, "collect" means gather, acquire or obtain by any means, information in circumstances where the individual is identifiable or identified. <br><br>1.2 dstore collects Personal Information primarily to supply customers with the products and services ordered from it and its related companies. dstore also collects and uses Personal Information for secondary purposes including: </p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>billing and account management </li>
<li>business planning and product development; and </li>
<li>to provide individuals with information about promotions, as well as the products and services of dstore affiliated companies and other organisations. </li>
<li>to enhance the online shopping experience by displaying products and/or services that match the personal preferences of individuals based on their previous website browsing history and/or buying activity. </li></ol></ol>
<p>1.3 dstore will not collect Sensitive Information from individuals except with consent and only where it is necessary for dstore to collect such information for an activity or function. </p>

<h3><strong><br>2. Use</strong></h3>
<p>2.1 dstore will obtain an individual's consent for Use of non-sensitive Personal Information for Secondary Purposes at the time of collection, unless the Use is a related Secondary Purpose which would be within the relevant individual's Reasonable Expectations. </p>
<p>2.2 dstore Uses Personal Information primarily for the purposes listed in 1.2 above. </p>
<p>2.3 If dstore relies on the Direct Marketing exception to Direct Market to individuals it will ensure that: </p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>the individual is clearly notified of their right to Opt Out from further Direct Marketing; </li>
<li>there is only one Use of the information before the Opt Out right is given and this Use applies across all dstore Related Bodies Corporate (if the information is shared between those Related Bodies Corporate); </li>
<li>the individual is given an Opt Out in all further instances of Direct Marketing if they have not previously chosen to Opt Out; and </li>
<li>if the individual Opts Out of all Direct Marketing the Opt Out will be respected by dstore and all its Related Bodies Corporate. </li></ol></ol>
<p>2.4 dstore will not use Sensitive Information for Direct Marketing. </p>

<p>3.6 dstore may Disclose Personal Information to avoid an imminent threat to a person's life or to public safety. </p>

<p>3.8 dstore does not generally sell or share its customer lists on a commercial basis with third parties but if it did, it would only do so if we had the appropriate consent of the individual involved.
