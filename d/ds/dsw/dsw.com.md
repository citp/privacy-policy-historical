If you create or modify a dsw.com account you may save personal information in that account, such as name, shipping and billing addresses and credit card/debit card information, and we will access this saved information to make your shopping quicker and easier. Any credit card/debit card information will be encrypted by the use of a "token" for security purposes. We also require you to create and/or access your account to use various services on the website, including creating a product review. Because you must create or access your dsw.com account prior to creating a review, it is possible that we could associate you with the review you provide. Information you include in a product review may be used by us to enhance and personalize our product offerings to you.

If at any time you would like to stop future delivery of promotional email (including DSW Rewards and wish list), please follow the removal instructions located at the bottom of each message. Asking us to stop delivery of future promotional email will not prevent you from receiving email communications relating to any online order you place at dsw.com, requests to participate in surveys about our products other operational email communications or emails forwarded to you by a friend that tell you about our products.

We use third parties to help us provide services to you such as fulfilling orders, processing payments, monitoring online activity at dsw.com, conducting surveys, maintaining our database, taking and processing gift card and eGift Card orders, administering emails, operating co-brand credit card programs and administering drawings or contests. Third parties also provide aggregate, comparative information on the performance of our site to us and a select group.

If, after making a purchase at dsw.com, you choose to participate in a survey or review you will be providing it to a third party whom we use to process the product reviews. Product reviews that comply with the review rules noted may be published on this website, and some may be published through other communication channels, including, but not limited to emails, television and catalogs. Published reviews may identify the author's review nickname and location or designate the reviewer as a Rewards member or rate the reviewer.
