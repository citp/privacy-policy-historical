1\. General Browsing Information

dsw.com gathers navigational information during each visitor’s use of our website. In the process of gathering navigational information, non-personally identifiable information (i.e. domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address) may be collected. The navigational information tells dsw.com about the use of our website by visitors, including the areas of our site that are most visited or the time of a last visit to a page on our site. It also tells us about the technical efficiencies of our website and services (i.e. the time it takes a visitor to connect to our website or download pages). The navigational information helps us better understand a visitor’s experience at dsw.com and improve upon that experience by recognizing and delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors prefer.

2\. Personal Information

DSW may ask you to provide personal information when you establish or update a dsw.com account, sign up for the DSW Rewards program or manage your Rewards account, sign up for or manage your text alerts, place an in-store order, enter a contest, participate in a survey, shop online, check the status of an order or review order history, provide a review about our products, purchase and send a gift card or eGift Card, search for products on our site or provide information about your shoe preferences.

Categories of information collected include name, address, email address, recipient’s name and email address, DSW Rewards number (which can be associated with the personal information you provided when you signed up for DSW Rewards or when you update the account), order information, telephone number, credit card information, birth month and day, your review of our products, saved searches, preferred brands, messages or reminders you create. 

  


DSW uses the personal information we collect from you in stores or online at dsw.com for the following purposes: 

  * to deliver products that you have ordered, fulfill requests that you have created, and process your return or exchange;
  * to understand your needs and preferences, possibly through surveys, product evaluations or cookies;
  * to develop, market and sell products and services to you and to tailor your experience on the dsw.com website to your interests;
  * to contact you or the product recipient(s) in the event of order or delivery difficulties;
  * to manage and develop DSW’s business and operations, administer accounts, collect and process payments;
  * to respond to your inquiries; 
  * to send our DSW Rewards members updates about the Rewards program, their rewards, and our products, promotions and events; and
  * to deliver information through the various communication channels you have provided to us about our products or website, including adding you to a DSW email list or to our customer phone and mail marketing list when you register for an account, sign up for DSW Rewards or make a purchase.



If you create or modify a dsw.com account you may save personal information in that account, such as name, shipping and billing addresses, and credit card information, and we will access this saved information to make your shopping quicker and easier. We also require you to create and/or access your account to use various services on the website, including creating a product review. Because you must create or access your dsw.com account prior to creating a review, it is possible that we could associate you with the review you provide. Information you include in a product review may be used by us to enhance and personalize our product offerings to you.

If at any time you would like to stop future delivery of promotional email (including DSW Rewards), please follow the removal instructions located at the bottom of each message. Asking us to stop delivery of future promotional email will not prevent you from receiving email communications relating to any online order you place at dsw.com, requests to participate in surveys about our products  other operational email communications or emails forwarded to you by a friend that tell you about our products.

  


We use third parties to help us provide services to you such as fulfilling orders, processing payments, monitoring online activity at dsw.com, conducting surveys, maintaining our database, taking and processing gift card and eGift Card orders, administering emails, and administering drawings or contests. Third parties also provide aggregate, comparative information on the performance of our site to us and a select group.

If, after making a purchase at dsw.com, you choose to participate in a survey or review you will be providing it to a third party whom we use to process the product reviews. Product reviews that comply with the review rules noted may be published on this website, and some may be published through other communciation channels, including, but not limited to emails, television and catalogs. Published reviews may identify the author’s review nickname and location or designate the reviewer as a Rewards member or rate the reviewer. 

If you make a purchase on our website, create or modify an account, sign up for DSW Rewards or modify your Rewards account after 4/7/2008, your name, mailing address, phone number or purchase information may be made available to other companies who may provide you with information about their products or services.

If you provide your email address to us after 4/7/2008 (including updating your email information), provided you have not opted out of receiving marketing emails from us, your email address may also be shared with other companies, so that those businesses may send you information about their products. 

In addition, DSW may participate with certain unrelated companies who will link you to our website, which may include recognition of purchases from dsw.com. dsw.com may share personally identifiable information we collect from you with the company linking to our website. dsw.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of the companies providing these links and we encourage you to review the privacy policy of each of these companies.
