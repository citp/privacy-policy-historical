When you click on an ad delivered by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is placed on your browser.

If you visit certain pages on our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can tell that you clicked on the ad and were directed to that page. Each Google AdWords customer has a different cookie, so it is not possible to track cookies via websites of other AdWords customers.

Customers can see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were directed to a page containing a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive information that enables them to identify users personally.

Google Remarketing and Similar Audience Technology 4 | Various: see [Types of cookies used by Google](https://policies.google.com/technologies/types)**

Our websites use retargeting and similar audience technology provided by Google. This technology enables us to target visitors of our website with remarketing ads who already have shown interest in our products. The ads are displayed by using a cookie-based analysis of the previous usage data. Personal data will not be stored. In the case of retargeting technology, a cookie will be stored on your browser in order to collect anonymized date about your interests and adapt ads specifically according to the stored information. Later, if you perform Google searches or see advertisements from the Google network on other websites, we have the possibility of presenting you targeted ads of our products there (known as remarketing). If you have a Google account, Google can link this data with your Google account.  
Similar audience targeting allows DHL to show ads to people who share characteristics with people on the existing remarketing lists.

When you click on one of these buttons, a cookie may be set by the service you have chosen to share content through. DHL does not control the use of these cookies and you should therefore check the relevant third party's website for more information. The 'share buttons' are provided by AddThis. For more information about their data collection practices, please take a look at the [AddThis Privacy Policy](http://www.addthis.com/privacy/terms-of-service).

**Third Party Cookies in embedded content**  


Please note that on some pages of our websites you may notice that cookies have been set that are not related to DHL. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Vimeo, these service providers may set their own cookies on your web browser.

In order to keep DHL's online content relevant, easy to use and up-to-date, we use web analytics services such as Adobe Analytics and Webtrends (see Webtrends entry in DHL Table of Cookies above for more information.) to help us understand how people use our websites. These services use data collection technologies such as web beacons. Web beacons are small electronic images that deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and website effectiveness. In turn, this lets us know what content is of interest to our visitors and helps us provide tailored information on our websites. These web beacons are anonymous and do not contain or collect any information that identifies you. The information is anonymous and only used for statistical purposes. These web analytics data and cookies cannot be used to identify you as a natural person as they never contain personal information such as your name or email address.
