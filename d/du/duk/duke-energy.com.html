<!-- ##### BEGIN CONTENT ##### -->
<p>Privacy has always been an important part of how we do business. We would like to make our policy concerning information collection and use absolutely clear. This notice explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way information is collected and used.</p>

<p>To improve our website, we collect information on the number of visits to our website, the time visitors spend on the web site, the number of pages viewed and the domains from which visitors visit our web site. This information is only analyzed by us in the aggregate; it is not associated with any specific individuals.</p>

<p>Parts of our website use cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive or in your computer’s memory containing information about your visit and preferences. You may receive a cookie that compiles site usage information (number of visitors, most popular pages, etc.) and enhances your experience on our web site. Many popular browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies.</p>

<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>

<p>Duke Energy does not sell the personally identifiable information you provide for financial gain nor does Duke Energy share such information with third parties for the purpose of sending you advertisements for products or services unaffiliated with Duke Energy or with its affiliates or business partners. Duke Energy may, however, share personally identifiable information that you provide to us for legitimate business purposes, including without limitation the following:</p>

<ol>    <li>Transferring such information to Duke Energy’s affiliates and subsidiaries, unless such transfer is prohibited by law; </li>
    <li> Transferring such information as part of a merger, consolidation, acquisition, divestiture or other corporate restructuring (including bankruptcy); </li>
    <li> Making such information available to third parties who are providing the product, service or information that you have requested (but never your password); </li>
    <li> Making such information available to third parties who are providing services to Duke Energy or its subsidiaries or affiliates (e.g., providing such information to third parties performing computer-related services for Duke Energy or its affiliates (but never your password)); </li>
    <li> We form a good-faith belief that disclosure of such information is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding any illegal activities or regarding interference with the operation of our site or violation of its terms of use; or </li>
    <li> Disclosing such information is allowed by law or our legal counsel forms a good-faith belief that such disclosure is required by federal or state law, subpoena or court order.</li>
</ol>

<p>By providing personally identifiable information, you expressly consent to these privacy practices.</p>

<p>Also, Duke Energy reserves the right to share any aggregated information (i.e., non-personally identifiable information) with any third parties for any reason, unless prohibited by law.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>Duke Energy uses the highest available industry-standard practices to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration and destruction. Such measures include firewalls and Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) to encrypt and protect certain sensitive transmissions of information. However, no security system is fail-safe, and Duke Energy cannot guarantee the information you provide will never be obtained by unauthorized persons. The yellow lock at the bottom right-hand corner of a web page indicates that a user is on a secured site.  In some areas of our web site, we require a user ID and password for you to access certain information.  Duke Energy will not disclose such password to third parties; however, you are responsible for maintaining the privacy and security of your password.</p>

<p><strong>Obtaining And Correcting Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

<p>If you wish to obtain a copy of the personally identifiable information that we have obtained from you through your use of this site, or you believe that we have personally identifiable information about you that is in error or you wish to delete any personally identifiable information that we have obtained from you through your use of our site, please contact us using the information below:</p>

<p><strong>Links to Non-Duke Energy Sites</strong></p>

<p>For the convenience of our users, some pages of our website offer you the ability to link to and view pages of website not operated or controlled by Duke Energy (such as weather and financial information). Often, but not always, you can tell that you have linked to a non-Duke Energy website because the website will open a separate browser window. Links by Duke Energy to such external websites do not imply endorsement by Duke Energy of that company, its site or its privacy policy. Duke Energy and its affiliates do not monitor or control the content or the privacy policies of the external sites and are therefore not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of linked external websites. When using a link to a non-Duke Energy website, we recommend that you investigate the privacy practices and policies of such external site.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>Duke Energy reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time. If we decide to change our policy regarding privacy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on our website. You may want to visit this website periodically to review the current Privacy Policy. Use of our website after the posting of a revised privacy policy constitutes your agreement with the revised policy. This Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</p>
