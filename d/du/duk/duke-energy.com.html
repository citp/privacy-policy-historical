<p>We use these tracking technologies at the point of collection of your personal information, not in e-mails that you receive from us.&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Information Sharing</h4>
<p>Duke Energy does not sell the personal information or e-mail addresses you provide, nor does Duke Energy share such information with third parties for the purpose of sending you advertisements for products or services unaffiliated with Duke Energy or with its affiliates or business partners. &nbsp;Duke Energy may, however, share personal information or e-mail addresses that you provide to us for legitimate business purposes, including, without limitation, the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transferring such information to Duke Energy’s affiliates and subsidiaries, unless such transfer is prohibited by law </li>

<h4>Security </h4>
<p>Duke Energy uses industry-standard practices to protect your personal information and e-mail address from loss, misuse, alteration and destruction. &nbsp;Such measures include firewalls and Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) to encrypt and protect certain sensitive transmissions of information. &nbsp;However, no security system is fail-safe, and Duke Energy cannot guarantee the information you provide will never be obtained by unauthorized persons. &nbsp;The yellow lock at the bottom right-hand corner of a Web page indicates that a user is on a secured site. &nbsp;In some areas of our Web site, we require a user ID and password for you to access certain information. &nbsp;Duke Energy will not intentionally disclose any such password to third parties; however, you are responsible for maintaining the privacy and security of your password.</p>
