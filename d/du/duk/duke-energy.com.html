If you choose not to provide this information, we may not be able to provide you with the requested service or complete your transaction.)</p>

<ul>
    <li>use certain specific services offered in customer account transaction areas </li>
    <li>customize some areas within our site </li>
    <li>ask detailed questions or request information to meet your specific needs</li>

<p><strong>Appended Information</strong><strong> </strong><br>
During the Start Service process, Duke Energy supplements/appends the information you provide with additional data received from third party sources. This supplemental information helps us to verify, update and correct the information our customers provide as well as help us determine if a deposit will be needed in order to provide you with services.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Collection of Information</strong><br>
We receive and store certain types of information when you interact with our website, mobile Web site, e-mails, and online advertising to monitor proper functionality, determine areas for continuous improvement, and to support website analytics and marketing campaigns. We collect information such as the number of visits to our site and mobile Web site, mobile device identifier and operating system, the amount of time visitors spend on the site and mobile Web site, the number of pages viewed and the domains from which visitors visit the site.&nbsp; This information is gathered automatically and we store it in log files.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Examples include Internet protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring websites, exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data meaning the path you take to navigate through our Web pages.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To collect this information, we use tracking technologies like cookies and clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs). These technologies may be invisible to you, and we analyze the information collected only in the aggregate; it is not associated with any specific individuals. We use these tracking technologies at the point of collection of your personal information, not in e-mails that you receive from us. We also use a third-party tracking service that uses these technologies to track non-personal information about visitors to our site.&nbsp; This information is collected in the aggregate and is used to track usage and volume statistics.The use of cookies by our third-party tracking service is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>These third-party technologies may also be used to collect&nbsp; non-personal&nbsp;information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.&nbsp; If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may <a target="_blank" href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">opt-out by clicking here</a>.&nbsp; Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.&nbsp; You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p>We use "cookies" to recognize you as you use or return to our website or mobile Web site. This is done so that we can provide a continuous and more personalized experience for you. A cookie is a small text file that a website or e-mail may save to your browser and store on your hard drive. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our shopping cart. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. To remove persistent cookies, follow directions provided in the Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our website or mobile Web site, but your ability to use some areas of our website or mobile Web site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use the Information We Collect </strong><br>

</ol>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose any and all pertinent information about you in our possession if we are required to do so by federal or state law, subpoena or court order, or as we, in good faith, believe is legally necessary.</p>

Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>We also post testimonials on our site from customers who have given approval to post their personal information along with their testimonial. </p>

Duke Energy reserves the right to share any aggregate and statistical information (i.e., non-personal information) with any third parties for any reason, unless prohibited by law.</p>
