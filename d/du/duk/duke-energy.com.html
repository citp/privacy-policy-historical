If you choose not to provide this information, we may not be able to provide you with the requested service or complete your transaction.)</p>

</ul>
<p>You may be asked to submit additional personal or financial information such as identifying topics of interest, your title and function for business users, or account information in order to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>use certain specific services offered in customer account transaction areas </li>
    <li>customize some areas within our site </li>
    <li>ask detailed questions or request information to meet your specific needs </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Appended Information</strong><strong> </strong><br>
During the Start Service process, Duke Energy supplements/appends the information you provide with additional data received from third party sources. This supplemental information helps us to verify, update and correct the information our customers provide as well as help us determine if a deposit will be needed in order to provide you with services.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Collection of Information</strong><br>
We receive and store certain types of information when you interact with our website, mobile website, emails, and online advertising to monitor proper functionality, determine areas for continuous improvement, and to support website analytics and marketing campaigns. We collect information such as the number of visits to our site and mobile website, mobile device identifier and operating system, the amount of time visitors spend on the site and mobile website, the number of pages viewed and the domains from which visitors visit the site.&nbsp; This information is gathered automatically and we store it in log files.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Examples include Internet protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring websites, exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data meaning the path you take to navigate through our web pages.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To collect this information, we use tracking technologies like cookies and clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs). These technologies may be invisible to you, and we analyze the information collected only in the aggregate; it is not associated with any specific individuals. We use these tracking technologies at the point of collection of your personal information, not in e-mails that you receive from us. We also use a third-party tracking service that uses these technologies to track non-personal information about visitors to our site.&nbsp; This information is collected in the aggregate and is used to track usage and volume statistics. The use of cookies by our third-party tracking service is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
<p>These third-party technologies may also be used to collect&nbsp; non-personal&nbsp;information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.&nbsp; If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may <a title="This link goes to an external website and opens in a new window." target="_blank" href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">opt-out by clicking here</a>.&nbsp; Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.&nbsp; You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p>We use "cookies" to recognize you as you use or return to our website or mobile website. This is done so that we can provide a continuous and more personalized experience for you. A cookie is a small text file that a website or email may save to your browser and store on your hard drive. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our shopping cart. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your password, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. To remove persistent cookies, follow directions provided in the Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our website or mobile website, but your ability to use some areas of our website or mobile website, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use the Information We Collect </strong><br>
We use your information to provide requested services and to support our business functions. For example, we may use your information to:</p>

<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong><strong> </strong><br>

<p>Absent your consent, Duke Energy may, however, share personal information you provide to us for legitimate business purposes, including, without limitation, the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Transferring such information to Duke Energy's affiliates and subsidiaries, unless such transfer is prohibited by law </li>

    <li>Making such information available to third parties who are providing the product, service or information that you have requested (but never your password) </li>
    <li>Making such information available to third parties who are&nbsp;service providers to Duke Energy or its subsidiaries or affiliates - e.g., third parties performing computer-related services, credit card processing, email service providers, map service provider, employment services, sweepstakes administrators, credit reporting agencies, electronic bill payment services, or debt collection purposes (in the event of account default) for Duke Energy or its affiliates (but never your password). These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. </li>
    <li>We form a good-faith belief that disclosure of such information is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding any illegal activities or regarding interference with the operation of our site or violation of its terms of use&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose any and all pertinent information about you in our possession if we are required to do so by federal or state law, subpoena or court order, or as we, in good faith, believe is necessary or appropriate. In addition, in order to strengthen our network security, we may participate in partnership programs with public or private entities that involve the sharing of certain information collected automatically as described above.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not retain this information.</p>
<p>Widgets, such as the "Share" feature, support functions that require that you disclose certain personal information given your choice of participation. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>We also post testimonials on our site from customers who have given approval to post their personal information along with their testimonial. </p>
<p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong><br>
Duke Energy reserves the right to share any aggregate and statistical information (i.e., non-personal information) with any third parties for any reason, unless prohibited by law.</p>
<p><strong>Consent</strong><br>
By providing personal information, you expressly consent to these privacy practices. We may also supplement your information with additional information we receive from a credit check performed when you apply for certain services. </p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Requirements</strong><br>
Some state statutes, and certain state utility commissions with regulatory oversight of our Duke Energy utility service territories, require that certain customer information be protected from disclosure to our Duke Energy affiliate companies.</p>
