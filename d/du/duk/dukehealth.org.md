# Notice of privacy practices | Duke Health

The following categories describe different ways that we may use and disclose health information. For each category of uses or disclosures, we will explain what we mean and try to give some examples. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be listed. However, all of the ways we are permitted to use and disclose information will fall within at least one of the categories.

**For Treatment.** We may use your health information to provide, coordinate or manage your healthcare treatment and related services. This may include communication with other health-c are providers regarding your treatment and coordinating and managing your healthcare with others. For ex ample, a doctor treating you for a broken leg may need to know if you have diabetes because diabetes may slow the healing process. The doctor may need to tell the dietitian if you have diabetes so that we can arrange for appropriate meals. Different DHE departments may also access your health information in order to coordinate the different things you need, such as prescriptions, lab work and x-rays. We ma y also disclose your health information to people, such as ho me health providers, who may be involved in your medical care after you leave our care

**For Payment.** We may use and disclose your health information to other providers so they may bill and collect payment for treatment and services they provided to you. Before you receive scheduled services, we may share information about these services with your health plan(s) to obtain prior approval or to determine whether your insurance will cover the treatment. We may also share your health information with billing and collection departments or agencies, insurance companies and health plans to collect payment for services, departments that review the appropriateness of the care provided and the costs associated with that care and to consumer reporting agencies (e.g., credit bureaus). For example, if you have a broken leg, we may need to give your health plan(s) information about your condition, supplies used (medications or crutches) and services you received (X-rays or surgery). This information is given to our billing agency and your health plan so we can be paid or you can be reimbursed

**For Health Care Operations.** We may use and disclose your health information for healthcare operations. These uses and disclosures allow us to improve the quality of care we provide and reduce healthcare costs. Examples of uses and disclosures for healthcare operations include the following:

  * Reviewing and improving the quality, efficiency and cost of care that we provide to you and other patients.
  * Evaluating the skills, qualifications, and performance of healthcare providers taking care of you.
  * Providing training programs for students, trainees, healthcare providers or non-healthcare professionals (for example, billing clerks) to help them practice or improve their skills.
  * Cooperating with outside organizations that assess the quality of care we provide. These organizations might include government agencies or accrediting bodies like the Joint Commission and the Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Healthcare, Inc.
  * Cooperating with outside organizations that evaluate, certify or license healthcare providers, staff or facilities in a particular field or specialty. For example, we may use or disclose health information so that one of our nurses may become certified in a specific field of nursing.
  * Sharing information with the Duke University Police Department to maintain safety at our facilities.
  * Assisting various people who review our activities. Health information may be seen by doctors reviewing services provided to you, and by accountants, lawyers and others who assist us in complying with applicable laws.

When we hire companies to perform these services, we may disclose your health information to these companies so that they can perform the job we’ve asked them to do. To protect your health information, however, we require the business associate to appropriately safeguard your health information.
