My PhD in coaching came under Coach Krzyzewski at Duke [from 1987-1995]. I'll never forget the one thing he told me when he was interviewing me for the job: 'I don't want anybody coming down here that doesn't want to be a head coach. You're going to have your hands on all aspects of the program.'\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Notre Dame's Mike Brey</span>";
	textContent["2"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"I feel badly; Jim Baron is one of the good guys. I mean, he really is, and something should be probably have been called there at the end. I don't know what it was going to be. I don't know if our guy tripped over somebody else, but it looked weird and I feel badly that the game ended like that, but we should not have been in that situation where we were that close to fouling a guy.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Roy Williams, after a controversial call in the NIT semi-finals against Rhode Island</span>";
	textContent["3"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">Everyone hates Duke, and we're not even sure why. For some reason, we know that if the devil had a face, it would have little beady eyes (like Mike Krzyzewski's). If he had a voice, it would be nasally and annoying (like Krzyzewski's) and if he had a name, it would be impossible to spell and the sound would follow no laws of language (like, well, you know).</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Israel Gutierrez, Miami Post</span>";
	textContent["4"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"As far as our motivation, we don't need North Carolina or Maryland or anybody else to motivate us.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Coach K</span>";
	textContent["5"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"It will become an historic game, a benchmark game. Not just the way it was played, but who played in it and what comes about.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Coach K, on the instant-classic title game with Butler</span>";
	textContent["6"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"We just came up one possession short in a game with about 145 possessions. It's hard to stomach when you're on the wrong end of that. But, like I told these guys, with their effort, their focus, their determination, you're at peace with whatever happens on the scoreboard because you've got a group that's given every single thing they have.\" </span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Butler coach Brad Stevens after the championship game against Duke</span>";
	textContent["7"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"Then we'll be even more athletic than people don't think we are,\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Nolan Smith on when Mason Plumlee returns</span>";
	textContent["8"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">\"It was an honor to play in that game. But I hate losing. It sucks losing.\" </span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Gordon Hayward after the 2010 Title Game</span>";
	textContent["9"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">“I have a problem with it going out and not being official. It is his decision. He has not declared for the draft and once he does he can’t back out because he declared for the draft last year. But I am very upset with all this because the statement Patrick gave to DeWayne, he didn’t know it was being released tonight.”</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Patrick Patterson's mother, Tywanna Patterson, on how Kentucky has handled his possible move to the NBA</span>";
	textContent["10"] = "<span class=\"duQuotes\">  “He should be an expert on alarmingly non-athletic. So I’ll have to take a look at that a little bit closer because it comes from an expert who actually knows what it feels like to be alarmingly non-athletic.\"</span><br /><span class=\"duQuotes2\">Coach K on Doug Gottlieb, after Gottlieb called Duke \"alarming unathletic\"</span>";

<h3 class="pageTitleHeadlines">Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
DukeBasketballReport.com (DBR) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting our website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. 
This Privacy Policy covers DBR's treatment of personal information that DBR gathers when you are on the DBR website and when you use DBR services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that DBR does not own or control, or to individuals that DBR does not employ or manage. 
</p> 
<h4>Information Collected by DBR</h4>
<p>
We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information from our DBR users: 
</p>
<p>
1. Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. 
</p>
<p>
2. Automatic Information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. DBR and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, DBR cookie information, and the page you requested. DBR uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.</li>  
<li>DBR may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. </li> 
<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While DBR will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.</li> 
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>E-mail Communications</h4>
<p>
DBR is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the "Sharing Your Information" section below. DBR may send out e-mails with DBR-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. 
</p> 
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. DBR cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.</li>  
<li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of DBR's coolest features.</li>  
<li>DBR's advertising partners may place a cookie on your browser that makes it possible to collect anonymous non-personally identifiable information that ad delivery systems use to present more relevant ads.  If you would prefer to opt-out of this standard practice, please visit our advertising partner Platform-A's privacy policy and opt-out page.</li>  
</ul>
<h4>Sharing Your Information</h4>
<p>
Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone and that we will share your personal information only as described below. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>DBR Personnel: DBR personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of DBR business. 
</li><li>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if DBR, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred. </li> 
<li>Protection of DBR and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of DBR, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>  
<li>Syndication: DBR allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the DBR website. </li> 
<li>With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you when your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.</li> 
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Children Under 18 Years of Age</h4>
<p>
You must be 13 years and older to register to use the DBR website. As a result, DBR does not specifically collect information about children. If we learn that DBR has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents' permission before using DBR or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet. 
</p>
<h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>
DBR may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole discretion. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the DBR website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed. 
</p>
