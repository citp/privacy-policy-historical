To the extent that New Relic Spain&nbsp;is a “Data Processor” for the Users in respect of such Third Party Data, New Relic Spain&nbsp;shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the Third Party Data against any unauthorized or unlawful access, loss, destruction, theft, use or disclosure. New Relic Spain&nbsp;implements basic level security in accordance with Spanish RD 1720/2007. If higher levels of security are required, please contact us. User warrants to and instructs New Relic Spain&nbsp;that unless expressly indicated in writing, basic level security measures are legally sufficient for the protection of such third party personal data.</li>
<li>Limit access to the Third Party Data only to those employees who need to know it to enable the Processor to perform the Services, and shall take appropriate steps to ensure the reliability of those of its employees or subcontractors who have access to such Third Party Data.</li>
<li>Only process the personal data as specified by this Agreement and in accordance with the instructions of the User, and will not use the Third Party Data for any purposes other than those related to the performance of the Services or pursuant to the written instructions of the User.</li>
<li>Upon the expiry or termination of this Agreement, or upon request of the registered User, cease any and all use of the Third Party Data and will destroy or return it to the User.</li>
<li>Not disclose the Third Party Data to any third party without the prior written consent of the User. Such consent is granted on, for example, the User’s instruction to share a Ducksboard with third parties (public or within a restricted group).</li>
</ul>
<p>New Relic Spain&nbsp;as Data Processor may provide access to a subcontractor processor to any such Third Party Data if it reasonably considers such access and processing necessary to the performance of the Services. In the event of such access and before the access takes place, New Relic Spain&nbsp;shall ensure that an agreement with the third party is in place which is sufficient to require it to treat personal data in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement and applicable law. In particular, Users authorise New Relic Spain&nbsp;to subcontract the provision of technology and commercial services to members of its corporate group, as well as (but without limitation) Linode LCC, member of the US Safe Harbor program for the protection of personal data.</p>
<p>Data Processor shall provide Users with reasonable assistance in the event that the Customer receives a request from an individual or regulator under the data protection laws, provided that Users shall first use all reasonable endeavours to resolve the request without the assistance of New Relic Spain&nbsp;and New Relic Spain&nbsp;shall promptly notify Users of any such request received by New Relic Spain&nbsp;that should properly have been addressed to the Users.</p>
<p>User warrants that it has all the appropriate consents from data subjects whose personal data are submitted to New Relic Spain&nbsp;in the course of the provision of the Services. User will indemnify and keep New Relic Spain&nbsp;harmless from all claims, damages and losses it may suffer relating to or arising out of the processing of third party personal data submitted to New Relic Spain&nbsp;systems during the course of the provision of the Services.</p>
