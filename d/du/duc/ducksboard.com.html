      <h4>3. Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer</h4>
      <p>Due to the communications standards on the internet, when you visit the Few Ducks Website we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Few Ducks. Few Ducks also receives the internet protocol ("IP") address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, mobile device operating system (if you are accessing Few Ducks using a mobile device), as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We use this information to analyze overall trends to help improve the service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties without your permission.</p>

      <h4>4. Analytics</h4>
      <p>Similarly, this Website uses Google Analytics, an analytical Web service provided by Google, Inc., a Delaware company with registered offices at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View (California), CA 94043, USA ("hereinafter Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files installed on your computer to help the website analyze the use that you make of the website. The information generated by the cookies about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be directly transmitted to and filed by Google in servers in the United States. Google has declared it will use this information on our behalf in order to monitor your use of the website, compiling website activity reports and offering other services related with the activity of the website and use of the Internet.

Google has declared it will not associate your IP address with any other data that it has. You may reject the processing of data or information by rejecting the cookies, using the corresponding configuration in your Internet browser; however, this may affect the full functionality of the website. By using the website you are giving your consent to the processing of information about yourself by Google in the way and for the purposes described above.</p>

      <h4>5. Privacy Policy changes</h4>
      <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy as required to adapt it to future legislative or case law developments, and this will be reflected by the "effective date" below. If We make any substantive changes in our treatment of information collected at this website, We will notify you by posting a clear notice of these changes on our websites and in this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the website constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions. This Privacy Policy was last modified in May 2011.</p>

      <p>User warrants that it has all the appropriate consents from data subjects whose personal data are submitted to Few Ducks in the course of the provision of the Services.
