​

California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: <http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf>

Users can visit our site anonymously. Our Privacy policy is linked on our home page or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can be easily be found on the page specified above.

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices as well as GDPR regulations we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur, we will notify the users via email within 7 business days. 

​

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle and GDPR, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
