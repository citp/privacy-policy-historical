Dublin City Council seeks to promote the economic, social and cultural development of Dublin city and in doing so contribute significantly to improving the quality of life of the people of the city of Dublin.

The delivery of high quality services, tailored to meet the needs of all our customers, remains one of Dublin City Council’s core objectives and is included in our Corporate Plan. This quality service includes not only the level and quality of service given to our customers, but also the quality of our decision-making processes, the efficiency and effectiveness of our corporate operations, standard of our facilities and our ability to adapt in an ever-changing environment.

In order to provide the most effective and targeted range of services to meet the needs of the citizens, communities and businesses of Dublin city we are required to collect, process and use certain types of information about people and organisations. Depending on the service being sought or provided the information sought may include ‘personal data’ as defined by the Data Protection Acts and by the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR).  The personal data may relate to past and future service users; past, current and prospective employees; suppliers and members of the public who may engage in communications with Dublin City Council. In addition, Dublin City Council may need from time to time, to collect, process and use certain types of personal data to comply with regulatory or legislative requirements or as otherwise reasonably required for the performance of our functions.

Dublin City Council has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to assure you that in all your dealings with Dublin City Council we will endeavour to ensure the security of the data you provide to us.  

Dublin City Council creates, collects and processes a significant amount of personal data in various multiple formats on a daily basis. This data may be submitted by you through application forms or our website or through correspondence with you. We may also obtain information about you from other sources such as government departments or other statutory bodies and also from other third parties (including members of the public) and from public sources where required.  Dublin City Council commits to using personal data which is: -

  * Obtained lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner
  * Obtained for only specified, explicit and legitimate purposes
  * Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for purpose for which it was obtained
  * Recorded, stored accurately and securely and where necessary kept up to date
  * Kept only for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which it was obtained.
  * Processed only in a manner that ensures the appropriate security of the personal data including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing.



Occasionally we may be required to contact you.  When you provide personal data to one department within Dublin City Council, it may be shared with other departments within the Council as long as such internal sharing is relevant, proportionate and reasonably necessary for the performance of our statutory functions.  Examples of when departments within Dublin City Council may share information with each other include:

  * To facilitate the investigation and prosecution of regulatory breaches and offences e.g. the environment department may have information that would assist the planning department in prosecutions and applications for injunctive relief; and
  * To enable the set-off of moneys due to the Council, against sums owed by the Council to that person, pursuant to section 7 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No.2) Act 1983.



Dublin City Council may also share your information with other organisations where necessary and permitted or required by applicable law, including other public authorities and bodies.  Personal data may also be shared with third party data processors responsible for supporting the Council’s operations.

The main legal basis for processing your personal data is that such processing is (i) necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations and/or (ii) necessary for us to carry out our tasks in the public interest and/or in the exercise of official authority vested in us.

We will retain your personal data only for as long as we require it for the performance of our functions, after which time it will be deleted by appropriate and secure methods.  In the unlikely event that we are required to transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) we will only do so where we can secure the transfer with appropriate safeguards and where we have a legal right to do so.
