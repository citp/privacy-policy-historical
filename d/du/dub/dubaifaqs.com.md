# Dubai FAQs Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy   
  
DubaiFAQs.com collects data whenever a visitor views a page in their website. This may include which page or website a user came from, what search terms a visitor entered if coming from search engine results, the browser and operating system used on the visitor's computer. This is not unusual, all websites collect this, or similar, data as a matter of course.

##### Cookies

Cookies are small text files saved on a visitor's computer when they visit a website. Many websites store a cookie and these cookies are usually intended to improve the user experience, for example to keep track of products ordered on an online shopping website (this is only one of many uses).

DubaiFAQs.com does not store your name, address, email address, telephone number or any other personal information in cookies, nor do we record any personal information when you visit any pages on our website. If you visit the [_Dubai FAQs forum_](http://www.desertspeak.com/) and log in, cookies are used to keep you logged in until you log out (or close the window if you have not selected the "keep me logged in" option).

It is possible to prevent, or control, cookies being saved on your computer by adjusting the security settings in your browser but this may result in loss of some functionality (for example websites which require a login).

As cookies are simply text files, they do not have the potential to cause harm in the same way that viruses or worms do so the average user should not be concerned. But for those users who do not want any form of data stored on their computer, most internet security software will have a cookie scanning component and will highlight any questionable cookies when they scan your computer. 

##### Google adsense cookies

Most pages on DubaiFAQs.com display advertisements from the Google Adsense program. As part of that program, Google may save a "DoubleClick DART cookie" on the users computer. This is a specific cookie intended to help the Google Adsense program serve ads more likely to be of interest to the visitor. Users can opt out of the DART cookie by visiting the Google advertising and privacy center at www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.
