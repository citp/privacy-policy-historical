              <strong>2. Cookies and similar technologies</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We use 'cookies' (on the Website) and similar technologies (in the App). A cookie is a small text file used to store limited information about the user of
              the device. They help us to identify how our users use the Service and so that we can continuously evolve and improve it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>On the Website</strong>
              we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), which uses cookies to analyse how users use the Site. The information
              generated by the cookie about your use of the Site will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. At our request,
              Google will use this information for the purpose of measuring your activity on our Website, compiling statistical reports on overall website activity for
              us and providing other services relating to Website activity and internet usage. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by
              Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however, please note that if you do this you may not be
              able to use the full functionality of our Website. In addition, you can prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie by Google, as well as
              the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available from the following link:
              <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>.

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>In the App</strong>
              we use our own technology that allows us to improve the Service’s performance. This technology works by registering certain events in our database. These
              events may include start and duration of user sessions with the application, clicks on different buttons within the application, as well as user input like
              search terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have implemented Social Plugins from social networks so that you can share anything of interest to you with your friends and connections in social
              networks. Our Website contains social plugins to the external social networking sites such as facebook.com (“Facebook”), youtube.com (“YouTube”) and
              twitter.com ("Twitter"). Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304. YouTube is operated by YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry
              Avenue, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. Twitter is operated by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. The plug-ins, however, are
              not active until you click upon them. This means that no information that you visited our Website will be transmitted to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter,
              unless you interact with one of the plug-ins. Then, with every visit to our Website, which carry these social plug-ins your browser or mobile device will
              set up a direct connection to the Facebook and Twitter servers. In the process the Facebook and Twitters-servers recognize that you are currently visiting
              our Website. If you are a member of Facebook and/or YouTube and/or Twitter and you are logged-in while you are visiting our websites, Facebook and/or
              YouTube and/or Twitter will assign this information to your personal user account. By further interaction with one of the plug-ins, e.g. by clicking the
              Like Button and/or YouTube Subscribe and/or the Tweet Button this information will be sent via your browser or mobile device directly to Facebook and/or
              YouTube and/or Twitter where it will be stored on your respective personal user accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3. Sharing your information and International Transfers</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not share personal data with third parties except where we have your permission to do so. We may process your personal data through third party
              service providers which act on our behalf for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. In such cases, we will always implement the legally required
              safeguards to protect your personal data. If you are located in the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”), a transfer to territories that are
              outside of the EEA may occur where these service providers may be based. Where this is the case, we will use measures to ensure that your personal data is
              adequately protected in accordance with EU data protection law requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4. Security of Your Information</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We take the security of your personal information seriously and use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information
              against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. However, the transmission of information via the internet
              is not completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of your data during its transmission to or from the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5. Your Privacy Choices</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              If at any time you believe that your personal data stored with us are incorrect or if you would like to access them, you can update them via your user
              profile.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>6. Updates to this Privacy Policy</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect any changes: (i) in our policies or relevant laws; or (ii) in the functionality of the
              Service. Any updates will be notified to you.
            </p>
