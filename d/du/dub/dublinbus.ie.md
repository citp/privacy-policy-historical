**Who CIÉ shares your information with**  
CIÉ will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. CIÉ will not share your personal information with third parties except in responding to your requests for products or services. Your permission will be requested when you submit your information. CIÉ may share customer information across CIÉ-owned business entities and companies working on our behalf.

CIÉ contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products and services. Suppliers and service providers are required to keep confidential the information received on behalf of CIÉ and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for CIÉ. These service providers may change or we may contract with additional service providers to better accommodate our customers. CIÉ will not share personal information with any other third parties without your permission, unless required by law enforcement action, subpoena, or local law.

If a third party serves on CIÉ a subpoena or other lawful document compelling disclosure of your identity, CIÉ will use its best efforts to provide you notice to the latest address in our files. CIÉ is not responsible if your contact information is not current or if CIÉ is otherwise unable to provide notice.

**Your choices**  
CIÉ gives you the choice of receiving a variety of information that complements our products and services. You can subscribe to receive certain product and service specific information and CIÉ-wide marketing communications. CIÉ-wide communications may include new product information, special offers, or an invitation to participate in market research. We give you a choice regarding delivery of CIÉ-wide communications by postal mail, e-mail and telephone. We will make every effort to honour your preferences. This option does not apply to communications for the purpose of administering order completion.

**Your privacy preference and opting out**  
Examples of unrelated uses include sending communications about special offers, product information, and marketing messages. You can, however, choose to receive these types of communications by following the instructions at the time of entering your personal data ("opt-in").   
To opt-out of receiving communications you have expressly requested (such as e-mail newsletters, software updates, etc.), use any of the following methods:   
• Select the e-mail "opt-out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each subscription communication   
• Return to the Web page(s) where you originally registered your preferences and follow the opt-out instructions   
• Write to the CIÉ Webmaster - be sure to provide your name, e-mail and postal address, and relevant information about your CIÉ registrations. 

**Access to and accuracy of your information**  
CIÉ strives to keep your personal information accurate. We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to maintain customer data accuracy. We will provide you with access to your information, including making reasonable effort to provide you with online access and the opportunity to change your information. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting access to your data. Certain areas of CIÉ websites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and other personal identifiers.

**Keeping your information secure**  
CIÉ is committed to protecting the information you provide. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, CIÉ has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.

When you purchase travel tickets online or access your personal profile you can do so through a secure server. The use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology means that all personal information, such as your credit/debit card number, will be encrypted as it travels from your computer to the CIÉ Online Booking Engine. When received, the information is decrypted and processed in the same way as a normal card transaction by telephone. This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window. 

If your browser supports SSL, and if you entered our site via our secure server access, then transmission of any sensitive data will be protected. If your browser does not support SSL, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of any browser to enhance the security of further transactions, otherwise the transmission of your personal data may not be protected and CIÉ disclaims any responsibility in this regard.

**Changes to this statement** If there are updates to the terms of CIÉ's Privacy Statement, we will post those changes and update the revision date in this document, so you will always know what information we collect online, how we use it, and what choices you have.
