We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.

We collect personal information from you and any devices (including mobile devices) you use when you: use our services, register for an account with us, provide us information on a web form, update or add information to your account, or when you otherwise correspond with us.

For instance, the Consent to Electronic Record where the Company requires that you consent to entering into an Independent BA Agreement (in an electronic form) with the Company before the agreement is executed. The entire agreement between you and Dubli Network will be evidenced by an electronic record and hence you must consent to the use of electronic record.

You must also read the Terms and Conditions of the BA Agreement, Dubli Network’s Policies and Procedures and the Marketing and Compensation Plan for Dubli Network’s official website at [www.dublinetwork.com](http://www.dublinetwork.com/) and electronically acknowledge that you have read the documents.

b) Performance of a contract: applies where the use of your personal information is necessary to perform the terms and conditions of a contract to which you are a party or any other policies which may be applicable to you as a user of our Site.

c) Legitimate interest: applies where we use your personal information for our legitimate interests such as to improve our Site and related services, security purposes, fraud prevention, and to share information with our affiliates for internal administration.

The specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you are listed below:

### **_To provide services and manage your account:  _**

Simply put, we collect personal information to provide services on our Site. We use information about you to provide services to you including registration services, authentication services when you log in, provide customer support, management and processing of your transactions, to allocate and disburse commissions, and operate and maintain the Site. We also use your personal information to equip you with our website Terms and Conditions, Policies and Procedures, Marketing and Compensation Plan, Privacy Policy and any updates and changes thereto. Your personal information that we collect also helps us to prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraud, security breaches or other potentially prohibited or illegal activities.

### **_To improve our services and to communicate with you about the services:_**

We use the personal information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our services. We are always looking for ways to make our services smarter, faster, secure, integrated and useful to you. We use collective learnings about how you use our services, through your usage, activity patterns etc., primarily to identify areas for integration and improvement. Further, we use information pertaining to your BA status based on your rank and active subscriptions, your customer status and value of purchase in order to determine and allocate commissions. We also use your information to send out newsletters informing you about our new launches, additional tools etc. that may help you optimize your earnings.

We also use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the services, including your purchase confirmations, reminders about business package renewals, responding to your questions and requests through customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.

### **_Use of information collected from cookies:_**

We further use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like tracking pixels, website tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of the Site. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer.

One of the other primary purposes of the cookies is to give you a convenient and time-saving function. If for example you are adapting a webpage or you are navigating on a website, a cookie will help the website recalling your specific data in connection with a subsequent visit. This facilitates the process by delivering the relevant contents and navigation is made easier. When you return to the website, the previously supplied information is retrieved making it easy for you to use the functions you adjusted on the website.

Web beacons (also known as clear gif technology or action codes), as explained in the ensuing paragraphs, may be used for delivering cookies on our Website. This technology constitutes a tool that we use for compiling collected statistics on the use of Dubli Network's websites, for example how many visitors have clicked key elements (such as hyperlinks or graphical elements) on one of Dubli Network's webpages or blog pages or a newsletter. We can share the collected statistics from our website with partner companies.

The data stored in cookies allows you to avoid filling out forms at every site access. The cookies produced have a maximum expiration period of six months. Furthermore, you may use your browser program to manage or deactivate cookies produced on this page.

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, merchants, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

### **_Use of web beacons:_**

Webpages on our Site can also contain electronic screens known as web beacons - also called single-pixel GIFs - which make it possible for Dubli Network to count the users who have visited the pages and to provide adjusted services. Dubli Network can attach web beacons to advertisement e-mails or newsletters to decide whether the messages have been opened and whether the recipients have reacted. ** __**

Some of these web beacons may be placed by third-party service providers for purposes of measuring the efficiency of our advertisement campaigns or e-mail messages. These service providers can use web beacons for placing a continuing cookie on your computer. By doing this it is possible for the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or read specific email messages, and to collect anonymous information in connection with showing these pages. Dubli Network does not permit web beacons to be used for collecting or obtaining access to your personal data.

### **_For provision of customer support: _**

When you contact us, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing be it technical in nature or for example regarding your commission payouts.

### **_To protect our legitimate business interests and comply with legal and regulatory provisions_** : 

Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with purposes which are a part of the normal business course of operations.

We may also use your information where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not described above. While you have the right to provide us with your consent for the use of your specific information, you also have the right to manage your choice at any time (see Section 7 for further details).

We may share the information we collect, including your personal information, with the Group Companies and third parties. This disclosure may be required for us to provide you access to our services, to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our User Terms Agreement, to facilitate our marketing and advertising activities, or to prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraudulent or illegal activities related to our services. We attempt to minimize the amount of personal information we disclose to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish the specified purpose. For example:

### **_Sharing of information with third-party service providers:  _**

We work with third-party service providers to provide hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. A service provider accesses information about you, to the extent required, to perform services on our behalf. They do so under instructions from us and in line with our prevalent policies and procedures designed to protect your information. We do not sell your information to these third-party service providers. The third-parties with which we share your information primarily include:

  * Payment processors
  * Providers of business analytics services

  * Web performance and security partners
