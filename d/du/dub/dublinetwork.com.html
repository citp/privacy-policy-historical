This declaration of protection of personal information explains the procedures for data collection and use on DubLi Network.com. When you visit the Website, you accept the procedures for data collection and use described in this declaration on protection of personal information.<br><strong><br>Collection of your personal information</strong><br>We will ask you for input when we need information that identifies you personally (personal information) or information that makes it possible for us to make a transaction, for example in connection with ordering newsletters via e-mail, and to websites or services with limited access or in connection with purchases, sign-up for an event or a course. The personal information that we collect can be for example your name, your position, your company or organization name, your e-mail address at work, your telephone number at work, your work or home address, information about your job function, information about your company, and credit information.<br>The Website can collect certain information about your visit, for example the name of your internet provider and the IP address that gives you access to the internet, data and time of your visit to the Website, the pages you visit on the Website and the internet address of the website from where you accessed our Website. This information is used for improving the Website, analyzing the visits and managing the Website.<br><strong><br>Use of your personal data</strong><br>The personal information collected on the Website is used for servicing the Website and for providing the services or carrying out the transactions you have requested or approved. To support this use, DubLi Network can use the personal data to give you a more efficient customer service, to improve the Website and to make the Website easier to use by making sure that you won't have to enter the same information over and over again or by adjusting the Website to special preferences or interests.<br>We combine the data on website visits with anonymous demographic data for research purposes, and we can use this collective information to deliver more relevant contents. In certain areas with limited access on DubLi Network.com we would like - with your approval - to combine data about website visits with your personal data so that the contents we deliver may be adjusted personally to you. If you do not give your permission we cannot give you personally adjusted services, and we will not combine your personal data with data on website visits.<br>DubLi Network can pass on personal data if this is required by legislation, or if it is done in good faith and under the distinct impression that it is necessary to (a) comply with statutory requirements or legal actions initiated against DubLi Network or the Website; (b) protect and defend DubLi Network and DubLi Network websites' rights or proprietary rights or © act in emergencies to protect employees or representatives at DubLi Network, users of DubLi Network products, services or individuals in public whose personal safety is threatened.<br>Personal information, collected on the Website, is stored and processed in Denmark or in another country where DubLi Network or its affiliates, subsidiaries or representatives have facilities, and when you use the Website you give your consent of transfer of such information to a location outside of your country.

We use a number of different security technologies and procedures that protect your personal data against unauthorized access, use or publication. For example, we retain your personal data on computer servers with limited access, located in facilities under surveillance. When we pass on sensitive personal information(such as credit card numbers) via the internet, this information is furthermore protected using encryption, like the SSL protocol (Secure Socket Layer).<br>Protection of children's personal information<br>DubLi Network.com is a website for a general target group and we do not consciously collect personal information from children.<br><strong><br>Use of cookies</strong> <br>We use cookies on the Website to secure the integrity of the registration process and to adjust the Website. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your harddisk by a web server. Cookies cannot be used for running programs or delivering or transferring virus to your computer. A cookie is assigned unambiguously to you and can only be read by a web server on the domain that sent the cookie to you.<br>One of the primary purposes of the cookies is to give you a convenient and time-saving function. If for example you are adapting a webpage or you are navigating on a website, a cookie will help the website recalling your specific data in connection with a subsequent visit. This facilitates the process by delivering the relevant contents and navigation is made easier. When you return to the website, the previously supplied information is retrieved making it easy for you to use the functions you adjusted on the website.<br>Web beacons (also known as clear gif technology or action codes) may be used for delivering cookies on our Website. This technology constitutes a tool that we use for compiling collected statistics on the use of DubLi Network.com's websites, for example how many visitors have clicked key elements (such as hyperlinks or graphical elements) on one of DubLi Network.com's webpages or blog pages or a newsletter. We can share the collected statistics from our website with partner companies.<br>You can accept or reject cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you want to, you can normally change your browser's settings so that it rejects cookies. If you choose to reject cookies you may not achieve the full experience offered by this or other websites.<br><strong><br>Use of web beacons</strong><br>Webpages on DubLi Network.com can contain electronic screens known as web beacons - also called single-pixel GIFs - which make it possible for DubLi Network to count the users who have visited the pages and to provide adjusted services. DubLi Network can attach web beacons to advertisement e-mails or newsletters to decide whether the messages have been opened and whether the recipients have reacted.<br>Some of these web beacons may be placed by third-party service providers for purposes of measuring the efficiency of our advertisement campaigns or e-mail messages. These service providers can use web beacons for placing a continuing cookie on your computer. By doing this it is possible for the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or read specific e-mail messages, and to collect anonymous information in connection with showing these pages. DubLi Network does not permit web beacons to be used for collecting or obtaining access to your personal data. <br>Enforcement of this declaration on protection of personal information<br>If you have questions about this declaration, please use the contact sheet.<br><strong><br>Changes to this declaration<br></strong>From time to time we may update this declaration on protection of personal information. When we do that, we also change the date of "Last updated" at the top of the declaration. In connection with major changes to this declaration, we will notify you either by placing a high-profile message on the start page for the Website or by sending you a message directly. We urge you to regularly review this declaration on protection of personal information so that you may be up-to-date on how we help protect the personal data that we collect. If you continue to use this service, you accept this declaration on protection of personal information as well as any relevant updates.</td>
