Privacy Policy

 **Internet Privacy Policy**

Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing is committed to providing excellent service to all our customers, including respecting their concerns about privacy. We have posted this privacy policy to help you, the user, to understand the nature of the personal information that is collected when you visit and use this web site and how that information will be treated. 

**Browsing**

We have not configured this web site to collect any personal information from your computer when browsing this site. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with personal information, we will not know your identity, your e-mail address, or any other information identifiable to you. 

**Internet Protocol (IP) Address**

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet. When you visit this web site, the server used by our Web Host will make a record of your IP Address, together with the date and time of your visit, the type of Internet Browser you use and the URL of any other web site that referred you to this web site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. Thus, each user session is anonymous. 

**Links To Other Web Sites**

We are not responsible for the data collection practices, the privacy policies or the content of web sites other than this web site, including any web sites that are accessible via a link from this web site. 

**Legal Issues**

Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing will disclose personal information when required by law, or in good faith believe such action is necessary or desirable to comply with the law, protect, or defend the rights or property of Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, this site, or its users. 

**Information Needed to Execute the Transaction You Request**

When we need to collect information from you, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to register for the overseas Exhibitions, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, Company name and Trade license number. We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing your registration. The information you furnish when making a registration will be used in fulfilling your registration and may be used by us, or entities acting on our behalf, for marketing and quality assurance purposes. However, that information will not be shared with or sold to third parties for their own marketing purposes without your permission unless it is done on an aggregated basis for statistical purposes without any information that could be used to identify you. 

**Contact Us With Your Questions and Comments**

If you elect to contact us with any questions, comments or requests using one of the online forms that form part of this web site, you will need to provide your full name, telephone number and e-mail address so that we can be sure to be able to contact you. Depending on which online form you complete, you will be given the opportunity to provide additional information that will allow us to serve you better, although the additional information might not be required in order for you to complete and submit the online form. 

The information that you include in any of the online forms described above will not be encrypted prior to transmission, so you should exercise good judgment about the nature of the information that you include in the form (e.g. do not include things like your credit card number in the comments field). The information that you include in the online forms will be used to respond to your questions, comments and requests and may be used by us, or entities acting on our behalf, for marketing and quality assurance purposes. However, that information will not be used or disclosed for any other purposes without your permission unless it is done on an aggregated basis for statistical purposes without any information that could be used to identify you. 

You can also contact us by simply sending an e-mail addressed to info@dubaitourism.ae

Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing will not sell, trade, rent or release such information to entities outside of the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, for their use without your approval and giving you the opportunity to opt-out. 

**Privacy Policy Changes**

In the future, we may need to change this privacy policy. All changes will be made here so you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
