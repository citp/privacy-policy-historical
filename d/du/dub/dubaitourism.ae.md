**Cookies**

In some cases we may also collect your personal data through the use of cookies. When you access our Websites, we may send a “cookie” (which is a small summary file containing a unique ID number) to your device. This enables us to recognize your device and customise the online experience. It also helps us keep track of services you view, so that we can send you news about those services. We also use cookies to measure traffic patterns, to determine which areas of our Websites have been visited, and to measure transaction patterns in the aggregate. We use this to research our users’ habits so that we can improve our services. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser so that your device does not accept them. You can find out how to do this, and find more information about cookies, at [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/). 

We may also collect anonymous data (which is not personal data) relating to your activity on our Websites (including IP addresses) via cookies, or we may collect information from you in response to a survey. We generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems and target and improve the quality of our services. To the extent this information does not constitute personal data because it does not identify you or anyone else, we may use this information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever.

In addition to the express notice provided on our Websites when you first visit, your continued use of our Websites is your acceptance of our continued use of cookies on our Websites.

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from our Websites, including the information or content contained therein or the data collection practices or privacy policies therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Websites to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services.

In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and we do not have control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your user content.

If you suspect any misuse or loss of, or unauthorized access to, your personal data, please let us know immediately.

We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.
