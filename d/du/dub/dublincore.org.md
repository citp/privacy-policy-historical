# DCMI: Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Privacy Statement

We make no effort to identify public users of our site. No identifying data is disclosed to any third party for any purpose. Data that we collect is used only for server administration and Web protocol research.

This statement applies to interactions with the DCMI Web servers. It does not apply to email sent to DCMI staff or lists. Any questions regarding the web site and the privacy policy can sent using the 'Website Feedback' button at the top of every page on this website. E-mail interactions are guided by general net-etiquette conventions.

As is typical, we log HTTP requests to our server. This means that we know the originating IP address of a user agent requesting a URL. We also know the Referer and User-Agent information accompanied with an HTTP request. We do not log the specific identity of visitors. We occasionally analyze the log files to determine which files are most requested and the previous site or user agent which prompted the request. Our logging is passive; we do not use technologies such as cookies to maintain any information on users.

We also log requests to our search, cgi, and list maintenance services. This data is only used for administration and researching the efficacy of our tools.

Logged information is kept indefinitely as administrative and research material.
