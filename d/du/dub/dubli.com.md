We collect the following personal data such as, gender, first name, last name, postal address, country, phone number, username and password. You have the right, at any time, to free information, authorization, deletion or suspension of your personal data. Please use our ticket system at "Contact" to contact our support or send us your inquiry by mail or fax.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so that we can identify and delete that child's personal information.

**Disclosure of data to third parties**  
We do not provide your personal data (including home address or email address) to third parties without your expressed and, at any time, revocable permission. Exceptions are only made for our service partners who require such data in order to complete an order process (eg. A transport company responsible for shipping and a credit institute responsible for payment). In this case, transferred data is reduced to a minimum.

We may also disclose your personal information:

  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.



  
**Security**  
The security of your personal information is important to DubLi.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at [security@dublinetwork.com](mailto:security@dublinetwork.com)
