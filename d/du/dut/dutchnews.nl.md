# Privacy - DutchNews.nl

**Privacy and Cookies on DutchNews.nl**

 **Privacy policy**

We are currently working to become GDPR compliant.

At DutchNews.nl we collect information about our users for three main reasons:

  1. To help us to monitor and improve the services we offer.
  2. For statistical purposes to track how many individual unique users we have and how often they visit our websites.
  3. To sell advertising space on the site. This helps us to keep the site free of charge.



We do not monitor individual traffic patterns on our site. We only collect aggregate reader information.

We do collect information on our users through registration for the newsletter, through Google Analytics, and when you enter sales promotions and competitions.

We will respect your privacy. If you have signed up for our newsletter, or given us your email address in connection with a survey or promotion, we will not sell or pass on your details to any other company. We may very occasionally send marketing emails to you on behalf of trusted partners.

Please note that we reserve the right to access and disclose personal data to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate our systems properly and to protect both ourselves and our users.

DutchNews.nl implements standard security procedures and practices in an effort to protect both personal and non-personal information. However, no online data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

 **Cookies and third parties**

A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website’s server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each cookie is unique to your web browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what’s in your shopping basket.

Third party advertisers such as Google Adsense and DoubleClick will generate statistical cookies to track advertising impressions and conversions. This helps us attract advertisers and keep the website free of charge.

The use of cookies by third parties is subject to those companies’ own privacy and cookie policies. For more on Google’s privacy policy: tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
