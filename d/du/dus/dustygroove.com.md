## Security

Dusty Groove uses the latest encryption technology to protect your credit card and other personal information. All orders are placed through the shopping cart using secure HTTP connections (TLS 1.2, the successor to SSL). This is a protocol to encrypts all of the information you send us, including your credit card number, name, address and phone number, so that it cannot be hacked by anyone on the internet. 

**Previous SSL and TLS protocols** (SSL 2, SSL 3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) are susceptible to a variety of attacks and are considered insecure. If your browser does not support TLS 1.2, you should upgrade. Browsers that are at risk include: 

  * Internet Explorer 10 and older
  * Android 4.x-series built-in browsers
  * Older versions of web TV browsers
  * Most out-of-support and experimental browsers



If you are using a browser that does not support TLS 1.2, we recommend upgrading your browser so you can continue to visit the Dusty Groove website securely because in the future website may not display for you at all. This is strictly for your own security. 

You can find out how well your client handles secure connections at [https://www.howsmyssl.com](https://www.howsmyssl.com/). 

If you prefer not to use your credit card online, you can fill out the order form as usual and leave out your credit card number. We will email you confirmation of your order. The email confirmation will include details on how to call us with your credit card number. 

If you have difficulty using the secure order form and are using an older browser, you may need to update your browser. You can email us at [dg@dustygroove.com](mailto:dg@dustygroove.com) for details, or you can [place a phone order](https://web.archive.org/phone.htm).
