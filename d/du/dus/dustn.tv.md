# Privacy Policy • Dustin Stout

The simple act of visiting a website leaves a trail of information, a “digital footprint,” about visitors like you. Sometimes this footprint is vague and preserves your anonymity and other times it is tied specifically to you and your real life identity.

If all you do is click around and read pages, the data captured about you is vague. If you leave a comment or sign up for a newsletter, the data captured about you is sometimes very specific. Almost all web sites on the web today collect data in this fashion about visitors, and this site is no different.

 **It is our belief that you deserve to know how we handle your information.** Consequently, the Privacy Policy below is a disclosure concerning our intent with your data. It is not a legally binding contract. It is a statement of intent made in good faith.

If you are unsure what something means, please ask. Contact information is available at the bottom of the Privacy Policy.

Protecting your private information is our priority. This Statement of Privacy applies to dustinstout.com and Dustn.co and all its owned properties (including soopz.com, dustinstout.com, dustn.co, contentmagnets.com, visualcontentcourse.com) and governs data collection and usage.

## Use of Cookies

Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Dustn.co pages, or register with Dustn.co site or services, a cookie helps Dustn.co to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Dustn.co website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Dustn.co features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Dustn.co services or websites you visit.
