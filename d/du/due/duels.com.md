Registration. To use some resources available through Duels, a user must complete our registration process. During registration, a user is required to provide certain categories of information, which may include a name, address, e-mail address, and a password.

Optional Information. At various other points during your use of Duels, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. For example, you may wish to participate in a survey or a contest.

Passive Collection of Information. In addition to the information which you actively provide to us by methods such as completing the registration form, we collect information about how you interact with Duels. We collect passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience with Duels and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. The types of passive information collected by this site include, without limitation, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where you go within Duels and your behavior within Duels.
