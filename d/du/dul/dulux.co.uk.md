# Privacy policy

## Choice and consent

We respect the purpose for which our site visitors gave us information. We give users choice and consent over how their personal information is used, and remove names immediately upon request.

## Use of information

Personal information is used for three general purposes only: to customise the advertising and content you see, to fulfil your requests for products and services, and to contact you with news, for example, about specials and new products.

## Third party use

We do not sell, rent or loan our lists to third parties for e-mail marketing (exception: if the business which uses the information is sold by ICI, the data would be sold along with the business).
