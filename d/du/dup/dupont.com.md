  * Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies;
  * Demographic information and other information provided by you;
  * Aggregated information.



### How We Collect Non-Personal Information

  * Using cookies:  Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes.  We use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information, to facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site, and to provide you with personalized marketing.  If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies.  Some features of the Site may not work properly if you decline the use of cookies.  To learn more about cookies, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>

## How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information  


Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose.  In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location).  
If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, e.g., when we combine information you provide upon registration with Non-Personal Information to provide you with targeted personalized marketing, the combined information will be treated by DuPont as Personal Information.   


## IP ADDRESSES

Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  


## How We Collect IP Addresses

An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in DuPont server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.  


## How DuPont Uses and Discloses IP Addresses?  


DuPont uses IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, administering the Site and presenting content that is tailored to your country.  We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.  Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  


## INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING  


DuPont and DuPont third party service providers use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or similar technologies to track the actions of Site users and email recipients across non-affiliate websites over time, in order to personalize your experience on the Site by presenting advertisements that are more relevant to you.  For example, we use third party service providers, to present products and offers tailored to the preferences and interests demonstrated by your online activity over time.  


## THIRD PARTY SITES

This Privacy Statement does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site to which the Site or the App contains a link.  The inclusion of a link on the Site or the App does not imply endorsement of the linked site by DuPont.

## CHOICES AND ACCESS

### Your choices regarding DuPont’s use and disclosure of your Personal Information
