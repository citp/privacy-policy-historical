Please read our [Cookie Policy](https://www.dupont.com/cookie-policy.html) to learn how we and our service providers use cookies and similar tracking technologies including to serve interest-based advertising to you.

####  How We Use and Disclose Other Information 

Because Other Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we use and disclose it for the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information as detailed in this Privacy Statement.

In some instances, we combine Other Information with Personal Information, such as combining your name with your geographical location. If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, such as when we combine information you provide upon registration with Other Information to provide you with targeted personalized marketing, the combined information will be treated by DuPont as Personal Information.

Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

####  How We Collect IP Addresses 

An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in DuPont server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the date and time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.

####  How DuPont Uses and Discloses IP Addresses 

DuPont uses IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, administering the Site and presenting content that is tailored to your country. We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Other Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.

This Privacy Statement does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site to which the Site or the App contains a link. The inclusion of a link on the Site or the App does not imply endorsement of the linked site by DuPont.

DuPont does not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals.

DuPont uses reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under DuPont control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you suspect or have reason to believe that your interaction with DuPont is no longer secure, immediately notify us of the problem by any means described in the “Contacting DuPont” section below.

####  Your choices regarding DuPont’s use and disclosure of your Personal Information 

DuPont gives you many choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Information for marketing purposes. By contacting the [Inquiry Management Center](http://www.dupont.com/forms/privacy-request.html), you may opt-out from receiving future electronic marketing messages and request that we not share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes.

We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related messages from DuPont, we may still send you important administrative messages, and you cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages.

####  How you can access, change or suppress your Personal Information 

If you would like to request to review, correct, update, suppress or delete, or object to, restrict or otherwise limit DuPont use of, your Personal Information that has been previously provided to DuPont, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law) you may contact the [Inquiry Management Center](http://www.dupont.com/forms/privacy-request.html).

In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information suppressed from a DuPont database or otherwise let DuPont know what limitations you would like to put on DuPont use of your Personal Information. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.

We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.

The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

·         The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide requested services to you;

·         Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or

· Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
