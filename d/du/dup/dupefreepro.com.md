**Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used**

Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Products and Services, and generally, do not share this information with third parties.

This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.

As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non -identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.

  
Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services may be offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner.

Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co -branded Web Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent contractor seller, or no-affiliated partner.

Our company does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.

Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.

We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the services and products. This aggregated, non -personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.
