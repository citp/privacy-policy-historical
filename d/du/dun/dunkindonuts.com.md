We want you to enjoy every visit to DunkinDonuts.com, whether you're here to order coffee, or to tell us about your last trip to one of our shops. So rest assured, any information you share with us, from your email address to your favorite donut, will be carefully guarded through our use of industry-standard security software to encrypt your credit card number and other ordering and shipping information. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.

Dunkin' Donuts reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time. Be sure to check this page periodically for updates. This policy applies only to personal information collected online at DunkinDonuts.com and does not apply to information collected offline by Dunkin' Donuts. 

**What kind of information we ask for and why.**  
Information we gather from you is used to process your order and to make your visit productive and enjoyable.

**Inquiries.** If you request information from Dunkin' Donuts, or wish to share an experience you had at one of our stores, we'll ask for personal information such as your name, address, and email address, as well as store address and any other information you may wish to share, so that we can best respond to your comments.

**Orders.** If you place an order online, we'll ask for your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number, and expiration date. That's all the information we need to process, confirm, and ship your order.

**Promotional Events.** If you choose to take part in a promotional event, we'll ask for any information necessary to the administration of the event such as your name, email address, birth date and shipping address. We may, on occasion, co-sponsor promotions with third parties. We will notify you at the time of collection if third parties will obtain your personal information.

**Franchise Applications.** If you choose to, you may submit via [www.dunkinfranchising.com](http://www.dunkinfranchising.com/) an electronic application seeking consideration as a prospective franchisee. If you submit an electronic application, we will collect your name, date of birth, social security number, address, email address, other contact information, and certain financial and employment information that you must enter on the form. By submitting this information, you agree that Dunkin' Brands, Inc. may retain, use and disclose the information to respond to your inquiry and to help us conduct our franchise marketing efforts. Information on your online form will become part of any application for a Dunkin' Donuts franchise that you might later submit. We may disclose your personal information to our business units, agents, parent company, other affiliates and to other third parties as part of our consideration of your inquiry or any subsequent franchise application. We do not authorize unaffiliated third parties to use your personal information for any purpose other than consideration of your inquiry or application.

**Aggregate Information.** We collect Aggregate Information about you and your use of our Web site whenever you visit us online. For instance, we may collect various forms of "click stream" information such as entry and exit points for our Web site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. In addition, when users request pages on our Web site, our servers automatically log their IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web.

We also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to DunkinDonuts.com from affiliate Web sites and the purchases that result from this traffic. This information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase, inquiry or franchise application.

This Aggregate Information generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal Information under this policy.

**Disclosures**  
Your privacy is very important to us. We won't give any of your personal information to anyone outside of Dunkin' Donuts and our sister brand, Baskin-Robbins, other than our agents who may need, for example to fulfill your order, respond to your requests or inquiries, or help us improve our products or Web site. We may disclose the personal information you submit on a franchise application to our business units, agents, parent company, other affiliates and to third parties as part of our consideration of that application and to help conduct our franchise marketing efforts. We require our agents to respect our privacy practices and not use your personal information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions.

**How we protect your credit card and other personal information**  
When you input your credit card number and other personal information, we use a sophisticated software program (Secure Socket Layer Technology or SSL) to encrypt or scramble that information before it's sent so that even if anyone intercepts the information, it is highly unlikely that they will be able to read or use it. In addition, we take appropriate security measures to safeguard your personal information once we have received it. Although we can't guarantee that there will never be a security problem, we and our sister brands, agents and franchisees that have access to your information carefully guard against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information we collect on our site.
