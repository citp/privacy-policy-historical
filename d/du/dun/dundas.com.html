    Phone: +1-416-467-5100<br>

    Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@dundas.com">privacy@dundas.com</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Why We Gather Personal Information:</h3>
  <p>At Dundas, we gather and use personal information to process your   orders for the purchase of software licenses, services and other   products from Dundas, to facilitate and ensure the delivery of products   purchased and services requested and to process payment of such orders.</p>
  <p>We also use the personal information you have provided to us to   communicate with you about your purchases, to respond to any inquiries   you make, to manage your account and safeguard our respective interests.   We will send you important notices, and respond to any special needs or   enquiries you may have. We may also send you information about other   products and services in which we believe you may be interested.</p>
  <p>We only use personal information for the purposes that we have   disclosed to you.  If for any reason your information is required to   fulfill a different purpose, we will obtain your consent before we   proceed.</p>
  <h3>Types of Information We Collect:</h3>
  <p>Typically, businesses are the ones who purchase our licenses and   services.  In those instances, no personal information is collected.    However, on the rare occasion, an individual may purchase a license or   service for personal use, or an individual may use his or her own credit   card (and not the business's credit card) or otherwise submit his or   her own information instead of the business's information, to place an   order or communicate with us.  In those instances, personal information   may be collected.  The type of personal information we may ask for   depends on and is related to the reason (or purpose) such personal   information was provided to us.  For instance, in order to process and   deliver orders for products and services purchased or requested from   Dundas, we will collect your name, credit card information, email   address and other similar pieces of information related to the   individual purchasing the order.  In addition to the foregoing, the   following is a description of other types of information we may ask for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Company information</li>
    <li>Mailing address</li>
    <li>Applicable telephone numbers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The choice to provide us with your personal information, either   directly or through a third party, is always yours.  However, your   decision to withhold particular information may result in limiting our   ability to provide you with the services or products you requested.</p>
  <h3>How We Collect Such Personal Information</h3>
  <p>We may gather such personal information from you via email, Internet,   in person, over the telephone, via mail, facsimile, or from third   parties who we reasonably believe have your authority to disclose such   personal information to us.</p>
  <p>Through the use of website cookies (very small text file that is   added to your hard drive from a web page), we monitor the ads you see   and the number of times these ads are seen.  Through the use of these   cookies, we are able to capture standard web traffic information such as   time, date, IP address and browser, but in no circumstance do we (or   the cookies) capture any information that can identify you as an   individual.</p>
  <p>WHILE WE TRY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY THIRD PARTY WHO DISCLOSES PERSONAL   INFORMATION TO US HAS YOUR CONSENT TO DO SO, IF YOU BELIEVE THAT A THIRD   PARTY HAS INAPPROPRIATELY DISCLOSED YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US,   PLEASE CONTACT THAT THIRD PARTY. IF THEY DO NOT ADEQUATELY RESPOND TO   YOUR INQUIRIES, PLEASE LET US KNOW IMMEDIATELY.</p>
  <p>For purposes of maintaining quality service, calls to our customer   service lines may be recorded. A recorded message given prior to your   call being answered will let you know if your call may be the subject of   our random call recording quality assurance program.</p>
  <h3>Dundas' Website:</h3>
  <p>When you visit our web site, information is not collected that could   identify you personally unless you choose to provide it voluntarily. You   are welcome to browse the Web site at any time anonymously and   privately without revealing any personal or financial information about   yourself.</p>
    <h3>Google Conversion Data:</h3>
    <p>Dundas utilizes Google AdWords conversion tracking to help us determine goal 
        conversions for our advertising campaigns. As a result, cookies are used to see 
        where users navigate within our web site.</p>
  <h3>When Information May be Disclosed to Outside Parties:</h3>
  <p>Except as specifically provided for in this privacy policy, we do not   disclose any personal information to third parties.  The following are   the limited instances where we may disclose your personal information to   third parties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to facilitate the processing of your order and delivery of the   purchased products and services;</li>
    <li>to investigate potentially fraudulent or questionable activities   regarding your account(s) or the use of our products or services; </li>
    <li>to offer you related products and services that might benefit you; </li>
    <li>in anticipation of and in the course of an actual or potential   sale, reorganization, consolidation, merger or amalgamation of our   business; and</li>
    <li>when required or permitted by law.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The type of information we are legally required to disclose may   relate to criminal investigations or government tax reporting   requirements. In some instances such as a legal proceeding or court   order, we may also be required to disclose certain information to   authorities. Only the information specifically requested is disclosed   and we take precautions to satisfy ourselves that the authorities that   are making the request have legitimate grounds to do so.</p>
  <p>There are some situations where we are legally permitted to disclose   personal information such as employing reasonable and legal methods to   enforce our rights or to investigate suspicion of illegal activities.</p>
  <h3>Our Employees and your Personal Information:</h3>
  <p>In the course of daily operations, access to private, sensitive and   confidential information is restricted to authorized employees who have a   legitimate business purpose and reason for accessing it.  For example,   when you call us, our designated employees will access your information   to verify who you are and to assist you in fulfilling your requests.</p>
  <p>Unauthorized access to and/or disclosure of personal information by   an employee of Dundas is strictly prohibited.  All employees are   expected to maintain the confidentiality of personal information at all   times and failing to do so will result in appropriate disciplinary   measures, which may include dismissal.</p>
  <h3>How We Safeguard Your Information:</h3>
  <p>We use industry standard technologies and maintain current security   standards to ensure that your personal information is protected against   unauthorized access, disclosure, inappropriate alteration or misuse.</p>
  <p>Electronic customer files are kept in a highly secured environment   with restricted access.  Paper-based files are stored in locked filing   cabinets.  Access is also restricted.</p>
  <p>We manage our server environment appropriately and our firewall   infrastructure is strictly adhered to.  Our security practices are   reviewed on a regular basis and we routinely employ current technologies   to ensure that the confidentiality and privacy of your information is   not compromised.</p>
  <p>Our web site uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and 128 bit encryption   technologies to enhance security when you visit the secured areas of   these sites.  SSL is the industry standard tool for protecting and   maintaining the security of message transmissions over the Internet.    When you access your accounts or send information from secured sites,   encryption will scramble your data into an unreadable format to inhibit   unauthorized access by others.</p>
  <p>To safeguard against unauthorized access to your accounts, you are   required to "sign-on" using a user id and a password to certain secured   areas of the Dundas's web site.  Both user id and password are encrypted   when sent over the Internet.  If you are unable to provide the correct   password, you will not be able to access these sections.</p>
  <h3>Accessing and Amending Your Information:</h3>
  <p>You have the right to access, verify and amend the information held in   your personal files.  You may access and verify any of your information   by calling our customer contact centre at +1-416-467-5100.</p>
  <p>To help us keep your personal information up-to-date, we encourage   you to amend inaccuracies and make corrections as often as necessary.    Despite our efforts, errors sometimes do occur.  Should you identify any   incorrect or out-of-date information in your file(s), we will make the   proper changes.  Where appropriate, we will communicate these changes to   other parties who may have unintentionally received incorrect   information from us.</p>
  <h3>Questions, Concerns and Complaints:</h3>
  <p>If you have a question about the privacy policies stated on this   site, please call us at +1-416-467-5100.</p>
  <p>If you have a concern or complaint about privacy, confidentiality or   the personal information handling practices of Dundas, our employees or   service suppliers, please contact:</p>
  <p>Arnie Lash, Dundas Privacy Officer<br>
    Phone :   +1-416-467-5100 x115<br>
    Fax : +1-416-422-4801 <br>
    Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@dundas.com">privacy@dundas.com</a></p>
  <p>Before Dundas is able to provide you with any information or correct   any inaccuracies, however, we may ask you to verify your identity and to   provide other details to help us to respond to your request.  We will   endeavor to respond within an appropriate timeframe.</p>
  <h3>Updating this Privacy Policy:</h3>
  <p>Any changes to our privacy policy and information handling practices   will be acknowledged in this policy in a timely manner.  We may add,   modify or remove portions of this policy when we feel it is appropriate   to do so.  You may determine when this policy was last updated by   referring to the modification date found at the bottom of this privacy   policy.</p>
  <h3>Web Sites Governed by this Privacy Policy:</h3>
  <p>The web site that is governed by the provisions and practices stated   in this privacy policy is: www.dundas.com.</p>
  <p>The Dundas web site may contain links to other third party sites that   are not governed by this privacy policy.  Although we endeavor to only   link to sites with high privacy standards, our privacy policy will no   longer apply once you leave the Dundas web site.  Additionally, we are   not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other third party   web sites.  Therefore, we suggest that you examine the privacy   statements of those sites to learn how your information may be   collected, used, shared and disclosed.</p>
  <h3>GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>
  <p>This Privacy Policy, and all related matters are governed solely by   the laws of the Ontario, Canada and applicable federal laws of Canada,   excluding any rules of private international law or the conflict of laws   which would lead to the application of any other laws.</p>
  <p>Any claim or cause of action you may have arising from, connected   with, or relating to this privacy policy or Dundas's handling of your   personal information, or any related matters must be commenced within   six (6) months after the claim or cause of action arises, after which   time the claim or cause of action is forever barred, regardless of any   statute or law to the contrary.</p>
