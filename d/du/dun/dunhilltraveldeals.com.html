	<p>
		Dunhill Travel Deals also works with third parties with whom we have a service agreement ("Service Providers") who use cookies to aid in the reporting of aggregate site usage statistics for Dunhill's Web sites. Such statistics are not linked to personally identifiable information. Some Dunhill Travel Deals advertisers use "view-through" pixels to track the effectiveness of the promotions they run on Dunhill Travel Deals.

Depending on the promotion, this information may be shared, upon the explicit opt-in of the subscriber, with external third parties for the purpose of fulfilling the promotional components of the program, for example with an airline for the awarding of frequent flyer miles to a subscriber's account. Subscribers who do not wish this information to be disclosed to third parties may decline participation in these optional programs. Any promotional program which includes the sharing of information with a third party will have such a disclosure clearly described in the program's description and rules.
