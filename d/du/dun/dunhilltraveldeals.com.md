**Tracking:**

Dunhill Travel Deals uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. The cookie is a small text file that resides on your hard drive. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

Dunhill Travel Deals also works with third parties with whom we have a service agreement ("Service Providers") who use cookies to aid in the reporting of aggregate site usage statistics for Dunhill's Web sites. Such statistics are not linked to personally identifiable information. Some Dunhill Travel Deals advertisers use "view-through" pixels to track the effectiveness of the promotions they run on Dunhill Travel Deals. Such pixels lead to cookies being placed on your computer by these advertisers. Dunhill Travel Deals does not have control over these 3rd party cookies, and cannot access any personally identifiable information about you as a result of these cookies. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our web sites. You may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page. Dunhill Travel Deals tracks individual user response (clicks) on offers on its Web sites. This information is used to better customize content and advertising for you in the future. Individual user click behavior is not shared with third parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access to or control over these cookies.

**Related Mailings:**

Dunhill Travel Deals reserves the right to send you certain communications relating to service or products, including administrative messages, and periodic product announcements associated with your newsletter or e-mail product subscription(s), as long as you remain a subscriber to one of our newsletters or e-mail products.

**Sharing with Third Parties:**

We do not rent, share, sell, or trade your personal information with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy.

We may disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

If Dunhill Travel Deals is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choice you may have regarding your personal information.

**Refer a Friend Program:**

We may from time to time conduct a referral service to introduce people you know to our Site and services. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. Dunhill Travel Deals stores this information for the purpose of sending this email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at [techsupport@dunhilltraveldeals.com](mailto:techsupport@dunhilltraveldeals.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

**Third Party Offers:**

 From time to time, we work with third parties. You may receive an email from another travel company sent by Dunhill Travel Deals. We do not share Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties. These emails are sent by Dunhill Travel Deals on behalf of our third party partners. From time to time Dunhill Travel Deals announces voluntary promotional programs which include promotional incentives for subscribers. These programs usually require personally identifiable information (ex: name, mailing address or frequent flyer account numbers) to be submitted for those subscribers who wish to participate. Depending on the promotion, this information may be shared, upon the explicit opt-in of the subscriber, with external third parties for the purpose of fulfilling the promotional components of the program, for example with an airline for the awarding of frequent flyer miles to a subscriber's account. Subscribers who do not wish this information to be disclosed to third parties may decline participation in these optional programs. Any promotional program which includes the sharing of information with a third party will have such a disclosure clearly described in the program's description and rules. To opt-out from third party sharing please e-mail us at [editor@dunhilltraveldeals.com](mailto:editor@dunhilltraveldeals.com) or email that third party directly.
