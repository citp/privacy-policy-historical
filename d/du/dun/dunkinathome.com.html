                    <u>Information Collected From Other Sources </u>
                    - We may obtain information about you from other sources, including commercially available sources, such as data aggregators, public databases and other
                    third parties. This information may include name, demographic information, interests, and publicly-observed data, such as from social media and shopping
                    behavior. For example, if you are on another website, and you opt in to receive information from us, that website will forward to us your email address and
                    other information about you so we may contact you as requested. We may combine this information with the information we collect from you to help us tailor
                    our communications to you and to improve our services and products.

            <h3>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <u>Personally-Identifiable Information</u>
                    – We may share information among our various businesses and brands within The J.M. Smucker Company and its subsidiaries. We may provide your personal
                    information to third parties who provide services on our behalf. For example, we use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card
                    processing company to bill for goods. We use other third parties to provide promotions, contests, newsletters and hosting for our site. These service
                    providers may use the information solely in conjunction with the specific services they provide for us. These service providers are not authorized to use,
                    share, retain or store your personally-identifiable information for any other purpose. We may conduct joint promotions with other companies, and may share
                    with these promotional partners (and their service providers) personally-identifiable information necessary to conduct the promotion. We may also use and
                    disclose personally-identifiable information where we think it is necessary to investigate or prevent actual or expected fraud, or criminal activity or
                    injury or damage to us or others, including when requested or required by law enforcement or government officials. We will not share
                    personally-identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties. For California residents, please see Opting Out, below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Aggregate Information (non-personally-identifiable)</u>
                    - We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers who perform services on our behalf. This
                    information does not identify individual users. We do this for online data analysis and research purposes to help provide our users with relevant tool and
                    features. We do not link aggregate user data with personally-identifiable information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <u>For California Residents</u>
                    - We may share your personally-identifiable information with affiliated third parties, some of which do not share the name of The J.M. Smucker Company, for
                    their own direct marketing purposes. Because this category of affiliates is considered to be “unaffiliated parties” under California Law, you may opt out
                    of us sharing with them. To opt out, please send a letter with your name, postal address, e-mail, with the heading “California Privacy Rights” to:

            <div>
                <p>
                    The security of personally-identifiable information is important to us. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against

                <p>
                    You should keep in mind, however, that no data transmitted over the Internet is 100% secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be
                    collected and used by parties other than the intended recipient. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee or warrant
                    the security of any information you transmit to or from our web sites.
