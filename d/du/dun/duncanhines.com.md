    * To conduct business transactions, including purchases and sales of Conagra Brands’ products, or business reorganizations including the sale, transfer, change in control, or merger of Conagra Brands assets or businesses.

It may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, or by other entities acting as data processors on our behalf.
