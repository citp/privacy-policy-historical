# University of Dundee: Disclaimer and Copyright Notice

## Your Privacy.

Your privacy is important to the University of Dundee. This statement explains what information we collect when you access our websites, why we collect it and where we disclose it. Web pages on servers listed below can have many authors/publishers who we ask, and expect, to abide by this statement. Where information is collected via any possible method for purposes other than those stated here, for example, to monitor which students have accessed a particular page, the monitoring should be stated.

### Servers covered by the present statement.

> www.dundee.ac.uk  
>  secure.dundee.ac.uk  
> *.somis.dundee.ac.uk (where * indicates different names)

### What information is collected?

**_From web pages:_** The servers listed on this page do not capture any personal data. However, in common with most web servers, the IP address and the corresponding domain name of the client are automatically logged. The address of the page where the client came from (the referrer) and the software used to access the page (the agent) are also logged. On intranet pages where an ID and password are required we also automatically collect the user ID used to access each protected page.

**_From web forms:_** At various parts of the site you may be prompted to supply personal details using on line forms in order to receive goods or services. For example when requesting a prospectus you will be asked to supply an address. Each form requesting personal data should explain what will happen to the data you supply. Where possible our on line forms operate over encrypted secure transactions so any details you supply to us can be transmitted as safely as possible.

**_From cookies:_** Cookies are small files which can be passed to your browser and can be used to collect information about you. Although we do not use them at a corporate level, it is not possible for us to control their existence as individual web page authors may use them to enable the provision of a specific service. If you object to the use of cookies - whether we use any or not - you can stop your browser from accepting them (see your browser's preferences options).

### Why is the information collected?

Routine logging of web server activity is necessary for monitoring the service we aim to provide. As part of the monitoring process, logs are also used for statistical analyses. We expect all on-line forms which collect personal data to provide an explanation of what will happen to your data.

### Where is the information disclosed?

Information collected through routine logging is not disclosed to any third parties. Normally information collected through on-line forms would not be disclosed to any third parties. However, if the information has to, or may, be disclosed the form should state what will happen to your data and/or seek permission as appropriate.
