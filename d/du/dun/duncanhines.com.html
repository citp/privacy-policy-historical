<br>
Please note that when you visit this website, any personal or non-personal data you provide will be transferred to the U.S. where the site is located.  By using this website you consent to the collection, processing, transfer and storage of such data to the U.S.<br>
<br>
<b>Note to Parents and Legal Guardians</b><br>
<br>
While many of our offerings are intended for adults, some sites or features may be of interest to children under 13.  Please review our <b>Children’s Privacy Policy</b> carefully.  We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children’s activities online and instruct their children to never provide personal information online without your permission.  Children under the age of 13 should get their parent’s or legal guardian’s permission before providing their e-mail address or other personal information to Pinnacle Foods Group LLC or anyone else via the Internet. <br> 
<br>
<b>Collection of your Personal Information</b><br>
<br>
While Pinnacle Foods Group LLC does not require anyone to share any personal information in order to enjoy any of our websites, certain features made available on the company’s websites require Pinnacle Foods Group LLC to collect personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. Pinnacle Foods Group LLC also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.<br>
<br>
There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Pinnacle Foods Group LLC. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by Pinnacle Foods Group LLC for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Pinnacle Foods Group LLC Web site.<br>
<br>
Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Pinnacle Foods Group LLC public message boards or other community features, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Pinnacle Foods Group LLC does not read any of your private online communications.  Additional information about these features is provided in the Pinnacle Foods Group LLC website Terms of Use. <br> 
<br>
Pinnacle Foods Group LLC encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Pinnacle Foods Group LLC so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Pinnacle Foods Group LLC is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on, or the privacy practices of, Web sites outside of the Pinnacle Foods Group LLC and Pinnacle Foods Group LLC family of Web sites.<br>
<br>
<b>Children’s Privacy</b><br>
<br>
Pinnacle Foods Group LLC is mindful of the need to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13.  In developing its privacy practices on sites or areas of sites directed to children under 13, Pinnacle Foods Group LLC follows the guidelines established by the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) and the requirements under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  <br>
<br>
Pinnacle Foods Group LLC does not collect and store personal information online from children who are under the age of 13 without the consent of a parent or legal guardian, except as authorized by law and described in this policy.  In any site or area of a site directed to children under 13, Pinnacle Foods Group LLC does not require children to disclose more information than reasonably necessary to participate in online activities.<br>  
<br>
Pinnacle Foods Group LLC may collect a child’s first name and e-mail address without parental consent for the sole purpose of responding to a one-time question or request from a child, or in connection with certain sweepstakes or contests, but the company will promptly delete this information after providing a response or at the end of the promotion.  When a child under 13 seeks to participate in an activity that will require multiple online contacts, such as signing up for an online newsletter, or for certain internal marketing activities, Pinnacle Foods Group LLC may also ask the child for a parent’s or guardian’s e-mail address to notify them and obtain permission or provide them with an opportunity to opt-out of that activity.   Pinnacle Foods Group LLC may collect additional personally identifiable information from a child, such as the child’s address, in connection with special offers, sweepstakes, contests, and games, so it can award prizes.  You have the right to review personal information we have about your child.  Proper identification will be required.<br>
<br>
Pinnacle Foods Group LLC may share data about your child with trusted organizations who work for Pinnacle to maintain our websites or help us administer certain features, such as contests or sweepstakes.  These companies must agree to maintain confidentiality of any personal information they see.  Pinnacle Foods Group LLC may also share anonymous, aggregate data about your child with trusted partners in connection with features, promotions, features, contests, or sweepstakes.<br>
<br>
Pinnacle Foods Group LLC does not offer public forums, such as chat rooms or bulletin boards, in child-directed areas or sites.  We will not share personal information obtained from a child with another third party, such as a co-promotional partner, for their marketing purposes without your consent.  While Pinnacle Foods Group LLC strives to only partner with companies whose privacy policies are consistent with our policy, Pinnacle Foods Group LLC cautions that it is not responsible for the policies or offerings of any third party.   Personal information from a child under 13 may only be shared in <b>Exceptional Circumstances</b> described below without your consent.<br>
<br>
This Statement of Online Privacy does not cover the privacy and data collection practices of any linked site. Pinnacle Foods Group LLC is not responsible for the content, policies, or actions of those websites, and cautions children to always check with a parent or guardian before linking to another party’s site.  <br>
<br>
<b>Use of your Personal Information</b><br>

Pinnacle Foods Group LLC also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Pinnacle Foods Group LLC and its affiliates. Pinnacle Foods Group LLC may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.<br>
<br>
Pinnacle Foods Group LLC does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Pinnacle Foods Group LLC may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.

<br>
<b>Exceptional Circumstances</b><br>
<br>
Pinnacle Foods Group LLC reserves the right to use or disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by any law, regulation, or legal request, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law, conduct investigations or possible breaches of law, or comply with legal process served on Pinnacle Foods Group LLC or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Pinnacle Foods Group LLC or another legitimate third party; (c) facilitate the sale of Pinnacle Foods Group LLC or any of its brands and, (d) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Pinnacle Foods Group LLC, our employees or the public.<br>

<b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
<br>
The Pinnacle Foods Group LLC Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.  We may also use cookies to comply with COPPA.
