### Why We Gather Personal Information:

At Dundas, we gather and use personal information to process your orders for the purchase of software licenses, services and other products from Dundas, to facilitate and ensure the delivery of products purchased and services requested and to process payment of such orders.

We also use the personal information you have provided to us to communicate with you about your purchases, to respond to any inquiries you make, to manage your account and safeguard our respective interests. We will send you important notices, and respond to any special needs or enquiries you may have. We may also send you information about other products and services in which we believe you may be interested.

We only use personal information for the purposes that we have disclosed to you. If for any reason your information is required to fulfill a different purpose, we will obtain your consent before we proceed.

### Types of Information We Collect:

Typically, businesses are the ones who purchase our licenses and services. In those instances, no personal information is collected. However, on the rare occasion, an individual may purchase a license or service for personal use, or an individual may use his or her own credit card (and not the business’s credit card) or otherwise submit his or her own information instead of the business’s information, to place an order or communicate with us. In those instances, personal information may be collected. The type of personal information we may ask for depends on and is related to the reason (or purpose) such personal information was provided to us. For instance, in order to process and deliver orders for products and services purchased or requested from Dundas, we will collect your name, credit card information, email address and other similar pieces of information related to the individual purchasing the order. In addition to the foregoing, the following is a description of other types of information we may ask for:

  * Company information
  * Mailing address
  * Applicable telephone numbers



The choice to provide us with your personal information, either directly or through a third party, is always yours. However, your decision to withhold particular information may result in limiting our ability to provide you with the services or products you requested.

### How We Collect Such Personal Information

We may gather such personal information from you via email, Internet, in person, over the telephone, via mail, facsimile, or from third parties who we reasonably believe have your authority to disclose such personal information to us.

Through the use of website cookies (very small text file that is added to your hard drive from a web page), we monitor the ads you see and the number of times these ads are seen. Through the use of these cookies, we are able to capture standard web traffic information such as time, date, IP address and browser, but in no circumstance do we (or the cookies) capture any information that can identify you as an individual.

WHILE WE TRY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY THIRD PARTY WHO DISCLOSES PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US HAS YOUR CONSENT TO DO SO, IF YOU BELIEVE THAT A THIRD PARTY HAS INAPPROPRIATELY DISCLOSED YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US, PLEASE CONTACT THAT THIRD PARTY. IF THEY DO NOT ADEQUATELY RESPOND TO YOUR INQUIRIES, PLEASE LET US KNOW IMMEDIATELY.

For purposes of maintaining quality service, calls to our customer service lines may be recorded. A recorded message given prior to your call being answered will let you know if your call may be the subject of our random call recording quality assurance program.

## Dundas’ Website:

When you visit our web site, information is not collected that could identify you personally unless you choose to provide it voluntarily. You are welcome to browse the Web site at any time anonymously and privately without revealing any personal or financial information about yourself.

### When Information May be Disclosed to Outside Parties:

Except as specifically provided for in this privacy policy, we do not disclose any personal information to third parties. The following are the limited instances where we may disclose your personal information to third parties:

  * to facilitate the processing of your order and delivery of the purchased products and services;
  * to investigate potentially fraudulent or questionable activities regarding your account(s) or the use of our products or services;
  * to offer you related products and services that might benefit you;
  * in anticipation of and in the course of an actual or potential sale, reorganization, consolidation, merger or amalgamation of our business; and
  * when required or permitted by law.



The type of information we are legally required to disclose may relate to criminal investigations or government tax reporting requirements. In some instances such as a legal proceeding or court order, we may also be required to disclose certain information to authorities. Only the information specifically requested is disclosed and we take precautions to satisfy ourselves that the authorities that are making the request have legitimate grounds to do so.

There are some situations where we are legally permitted to disclose personal information such as employing reasonable and legal methods to enforce our rights or to investigate suspicion of illegal activities.

### Our Employees and your Personal Information:

In the course of daily operations, access to private, sensitive and confidential information is restricted to authorized employees who have a legitimate business purpose and reason for accessing it. For example, when you call us, our designated employees will access your information to verify who you are and to assist you in fulfilling your requests.

Unauthorized access to and/or disclosure of personal information by an employee of Dundas is strictly prohibited. All employees are expected to maintain the confidentiality of personal information at all times and failing to do so will result in appropriate disciplinary measures, which may include dismissal.

### How We Safeguard Your Information:

We use industry standard technologies and maintain current security standards to ensure that your personal information is protected against unauthorized access, disclosure, inappropriate alteration or misuse.

Electronic customer files are kept in a highly secured environment with restricted access. Paper-based files are stored in locked filing cabinets. Access is also restricted.

We manage our server environment appropriately and our firewall infrastructure is strictly adhered to. Our security practices are reviewed on a regular basis and we routinely employ current technologies to ensure that the confidentiality and privacy of your information is not compromised.

Our web site uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and 128 bit encryption technologies to enhance security when you visit the secured areas of these sites. SSL is the industry standard tool for protecting and maintaining the security of message transmissions over the Internet. When you access your accounts or send information from secured sites, encryption will scramble your data into an unreadable format to inhibit unauthorized access by others.

To safeguard against unauthorized access to your accounts, you are required to “sign-on” using a user id and a password to certain secured areas of the Dundas’s web site. Both user id and password are encrypted when sent over the Internet. If you are unable to provide the correct password, you will not be able to access these sections.

### Accessing and Amending Your Information:

You have the right to access, verify and amend the information held in your personal files. You may access and verify any of your information by calling our customer contact centre at +1-416-467-5100.

To help us keep your personal information up-to-date, we encourage you to amend inaccuracies and make corrections as often as necessary. Despite our efforts, errors sometimes do occur. Should you identify any incorrect or out-of-date information in your file(s), we will make the proper changes. Where appropriate, we will communicate these changes to other parties who may have unintentionally received incorrect information from us.

If you have a question about the privacy policies stated on this site, please call us at +1-416-467-5100.
