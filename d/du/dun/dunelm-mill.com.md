Our Security Policy

Our site uses high level SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology which is the most advanced security software currently available for online transactions. We have a server certificate known as Thawte Security Certificate. We use a secure transaction system from Thawte to encrypt and thus protect your credit card details so it is virtually impossible for unauthorised parties to read any information that you send us. This is a powerful tool which secures your transaction details with us.

In addition Dunelm (Soft Furnishings) Ltd is enrolled in Trustwave's Trusted Commerce™ program to validate compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandated by all the major credit card associations including MasterCard and Visa.

We are also an 'Internet Shopping Is Safe' accredited retailer. ISIS-Accredited retailers now account for approximately two thirds of all UK online shopping. This means you can shop online with confidence wherever you see the ISIS logo because it certifies that we have:

  * Registered with the ISIS programme and undertaken to trade in a manner that is legal, decent, honest, truthful AND fair;
  * Had our web site and service reviewed and monitored by IMRG;
  * Had our Business, VAT and Data Protection registrations checked by IMRG. 



Our customer's security is of highest priority so we have invested in the latest fraud prevention initiative (3D Secure) to give you an increased level of payment card security for complete peace of mind. Find out more about [ 3D Secure](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StaticPageDisplay?storeId=10551&identifier=dunelm_os_payment&brdcrmb_trail=dunelm_os_home&langId=-1&catalogId=10051).
