You may opt to receive communications from us by any of the following methods: email; telephone (including automated calls); SMS text message and other electronic messages such as picture messaging; post; fax or otherwise including products and services of other companies and organisations, which we consider may be of interest to you. You will be asked to opt-in if you wish to receive these.

You can be removed from our SMS marketing list at any time by texting STOP as outlined in any communication that we send to you by SMS.

### Links to third party sites

From time to time we may provide links to other sites. This privacy statement only covers Websites that we own and control. It does not cover links to other sites nor information collected by parties that own and control those sites or their use of cookies when you visit another site.

### Security on dunnesstores.com

We take great care to ensure the security of our Website. We use a 128-bit SSL (secure sockets layer) to protect your payment details. Your computer should automatically allow the opening of the secure connection when you place your order. You can tell whether a page is secure as 'https' will replace the 'http' in front of dunnesstores.com in your browser address window. A small locked padlock will also appear in the bottom bar of your browser windows.

Your personal data is only entered on our system when the browser is in ‘HTTPS’ or secure mode. The padlock symbol should appear when you are in this mode, indicating that you are safely submitting encrypted information only. To take full advantage of all security features you should use an up-todate browser. We will never ask a customer to confirm any account or credit card details via email.

**MasterCard Secure Code & Verified By Visa:**

To give you even more confidence in shopping online with dunnesstores.com we have introduced Verified by Visa and MasterCard® Secure Code™. These services enhance your existing card account against unauthorised use when you shop with us. To use this service, you must first register with the bank or other organisation that issued your card. We will take all commercially reasonable steps (including appropriate technical and organisational measures) to protect your personal data which you provide to us.

Whilst we do our best to maintain security within our Website and to safeguard your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you may transmit to us.

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

We may change this Privacy Statement, in whole or part, from time to time as we see fit or as legislation protecting all consumers and internet users’ changes to ensure we are fully compliant. Any changes will be effective immediately and will be posted on this Website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We may, as appropriate, update customers of these changes by other means, such as postal mail or email.
