<b>Our Commitment to Privacy</b><br>
Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine quality products and services with integrity in dealing with our users.  The Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services.  
</p>
<p>

<b>What Information Do We Collect?</b><br>
When you visit our site you may provide us with two types of information:  personal information you actively choose to disclose ("Active Information") and use information we collect, in a way not visible to you, on an aggregate anonymous basis as you and others browse our site ("Passive Information").
</p>
<p>
<b>Active Information You Choose to Provide</b><br>
In order to gain use of the site (become a 'user'), we may require you to disclose the following information:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Email address</li>
<li> Date of birth</li>
</ul>

At the users option, we also collect:
<ul>
<li> Geographical location</li>
<li> Demographic data</li>
<li> Preference data </li>
<li> Content </li>
</ul>

If you choose to make a payment, you will be re-directed to a 3rd party payment processor, whose privacy policy will apply ? to view it visit: http://about.ccbill.com/html_forms/privacy_policy-english.htm].  Please note that we are not responsible for their use of your personal information.
<p>

If you choose to post information on our site or maintain email, postal mail or telephone contact with us, we may retain such information and its transmission via email is not secured.
</p>
<p>

<b>Passive Information Collected</b>
</p>
<p>
What is a Cookie?  
</p>
<p>
Cookies are a feature of web browser (Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, etc.) software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a site.  They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on one site to simplify subsequent interactions with that site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transaction on related web pages.  This makes it easier for a user to move from site to site and to complete transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalised.
</p>
<p>

Our site's servers also automatically identify your computer by its Internet Protocol address which is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  Your IP address may be used to address problems with our server or administer our site or to gather broad demographic information about our users.
</p>
<p>

Information we may gather:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Network IP address</li>
<li> Click - stream data </li>
<li> HTTP protocol elements</li>
<li> Search terms</li>
</ul>

 

<b>How Do We Use the Information Collected?</b><br>

Broadly speaking, persons we employ directly, or as contractors or agents at our direction, use Active Information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer services such as support, and making available other products or services we think may be of interest to our users.  We may use the Active Information or Passive Information you provide to us to contact you about changes to our site, new services, features or products we offer, or other information we think you shall find valuable.  If at any time you do not wish to receive such information, you may 'opt-out' of doing so by disabling informational emails in your web site settings, or by deleting your user profile.
<p>
We use Passive Information to gather information about our users and to enhance and design our site to make it easier, faster and friendlier to use.  Additionally, our site utilizes cookies to uniquely identify individual users as they move through the site. The site may also use cookies to store login information and user status information. Cookies are required to be turned on in your browser for you to be able to use our site. Passive Information may result in your viewing of particular advertising based on your user habits for your viewing on our site and a shopping experience customised to you in content, services and goods.
</p>
<p>
Except as specified in this policy we do not disclose your personal information to third parties.
</p>
<p>
<b>Your Information In Relation to Others We Link To</b><br>

When you do so you are doing so subject to their policies regarding privacy and data collection and you should read those sites' privacy policies to make sure you agree to them before using such sites. When you choose to shop at such sites, you should read their privacy policies to make sure you agree to them before making purchases. We do not accept responsibility for their use of your personal information.
</p>
<p>

<b>Sharing Information with Advertisers or Other Third Parties</b><br>

We may disclose anonymous information about user habits, characteristics and user patterns, based on aggregate user statistics to advertisers on our site.  The parties who perform services for us (credit card processors, merchant bank, our Internet Service Provider) may also have access to your information in performing such services.  Should we buy or sell assets of our company, another company may need to review our company's assets, including your information, to make business decisions as to whether to acquire such assets. We will not allow them to use it for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
<b>Sharing Information with the Government or As Otherwise Required by Law</b><br>
We may be required by subpoena, law or government agency to disclose both Active and Passive Information you have provided to us.

<p>

We will not use your personal information otherwise than as stated in this policy.
</p>
<p>
<b>How Do We Secure Active Information and Passive Information?</b><br>
We secure your personal information submitted by you by using reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, or accidental loss or destruction of Active Information and Passive Information.  Your postings on this site and other communications you may have with us via email or snailmail may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures are in place prior to your sending information.  Therefore, if you choose to communicate with us through these means, you are assuming the risk of doing so and we request that you do not send or post sensitive information through these means.
