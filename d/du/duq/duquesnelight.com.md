# Privacy Policy

**DUQUESNE LIGHT COMPANY**

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Duquesne Light Company, its subsidiaries, parents and affiliates (“DLC, we or us”) recognize the trust you place in us when you give us personal information. We do not collect personal information via the DLC website (the “Website”) unless the user of the Website (“you”) voluntarily provide it to us. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, ‘personal information’ could include, for example, your social security number, bank account information, or your email or physical addresses. 

**If you do not wish your personal information**

**to be governed by this Privacy Policy,**

**DO NOT** **provide PERSONAL information to DLC over the Website.**

You are not required to use the services provided via the Website.   Much of the Website is available for your review and information without registering or providing personal information to DLC. 

This Privacy Policy does not cover personal information provided by you or on your behalf to DLC outside of the Website, such as in connection with the establishment of your electric account with DLC (your “DLC Account’). For questions regarding the security of personal information provided to DLC outside of the Website, please call DLC’s Customer Service Line at (412) 393-7100.

**_How We Use Personal Information_**

We collect personal information so that we may promptly and accurately respond to requests for information and/or so that we may provide online services.  We will not sell or provide your personal information to unaffiliated companies.  If DLC is involved in the sale of its assets as part of a merger or acquisition, user information, including your personal information, generally is one of the transferred business assets. In that circumstance, this Privacy Policy would still apply to your personal information, but your personal information may be transferred to the successor or assignee of DLC.

In some instances, we may use this information to inform you of goods and services that may be of interest to you. Except as provided herein, Duquesne Light Company will not disclose any information about you to unaffiliated companies or organizations without your consent, unless:

§ required by law;

§ we believe it necessary to respond to an inquiry or provide you with a service which you have requested;  or

§ to implement our terms of service.

In order to operate the Website or deliver a service we may sometimes share your personal information with a service partner under strict conditions of confidentiality. We will not otherwise disclose your personal information to other companies without your explicit consent. 

**Access to Your Information**  
If at any time you want to know exactly what personal information we hold about you or wish to 

change personal information that is inaccurate or out of date, please call our Customer Service Line at (412) 393-7100 and we will amend this record. 

**Security**  
Unfortunately, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.   However, we take all reasonable precautions to ensure the security of your personal information. The Website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Access to your personal information is limited to those required to support or service your account. Security procedures in place include password protection and, as appropriate, physical protection.Your personal information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. We require our employees and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by DLC. 

**Viruses**  
DLC uses appropriate commercially available anti-virus software to ensure that this Website does not contain or carry viruses. However, due to the rapidly developing nature of viruses and the Internet we strongly recommend that you employ similar anti-virus software when accessing the Website. DLC makes no warranty that the Website or e-mail correspondence is free from such viruses.
