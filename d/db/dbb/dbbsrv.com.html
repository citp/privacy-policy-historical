            <p class="headertext">The Internet, Privacy, and Darkblue.com (DARKBLUE)</p>
            <p>The Internet contains a wealth of information; unfortunately, it 
              may also contain personal details about you that you don't want 
              everyone to know. For example, your real name (lots of people on 
              the Internet use aliases, alter egos or nicknames), street address, 
              phone number, or e-mail address. When you go online, sites you visit 
              may be gathering information about you without your knowledge. At 
              Darkblue.com we strive to help our customers protect their privacy 
              while using our services.</p>
            <p class="headertext">Darkblue.com's Privacy Policy</p>
            <p>Darkblue.com's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of 
              our users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information 
              from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience 
              and we want to help you make it so.</p>
            <p>The information you provide for your personal Darkblue.com account 
              is shared among the Darkblue.com sites, as it is our goal to make 
              your visits to our sites easy and enjoyable. However, be assured 
              that Darkblue.com will not disclose your personal information to 
              third parties without your consent. Darkblue.com may disclose user 
              information in special cases when we have reason to believe that 
              disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or 
              bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to 
              or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Darkblue.com's 
              rights or property, other Darkblue.com users, or anyone else that 
              could be harmed by such activities. Darkblue.com may disclose user 
              information when we believe in good faith that the law requires 
              it.</p>
            <p>Darkblue.com shares aggregate information about our users with 
              advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. 
              For example, we will say Darkblue.com's audience is x percent females 
              and y percent males. This data is used to customize Darkblue.com’s 
              content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users.</p>
            <p>There are cases where Darkblue.com may ask you for personal information 
              such as your name, email address, and birth date. For example, we 
              request personal information when you register for a Darkblue.com 
              email account, for transactions, or for services that require registration 
              or subscription. Darkblue.com needs to collect this information 
              for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with Darkblue.com 
              policies as well as federal, state and local laws and/or for editorial 
              and feedback solicitation purposes.</p>
            <p>In case you change your mind or some personal information may change 
              (such as your zip code), we will endeavour to provide a way to correct, 
              update or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this 
              at the member information page or by contacting our Customer Support 
              organization at customercare@Darkblue.com.</p>
            <p class="headertext">Opting-Out</p>
            <p>Information provided at the time of Registration or submission 
              from a guest may be used for marketing and promotional purposes 
              by Darkblue.com and our affiliates or companies that have been pre-screened 
              by Darkblue.com. To keep you in control of your personal information 
              and the communications directed to you, we allow you to opt-out 
              of the following services: sharing your information in our member 
              directory, receiving communications from Darkblue.com about new 
              features or services, and receiving communications about offers 
              from third-party companies that offer a product or service that 
              we think would be of value to you. If a guest objects to such use 
              for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request 
              to customercare@Darkblue.com or by modifying his/her member information 
              online.</p>
            <p class="headertext">Use of IP Address</p>
            <p>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your 
              computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big 
              computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify 
              your computer by its IP address.</p>
            <p>Darkblue.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, 
              to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit 
              the use of our site. When guests request pages from Darkblue.com 
              sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally 
              link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means 
              that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous 
              to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when 
              we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules 
              or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or 
              others.</p>
            <p>Some services within Darkblue.com, such as certain message boards, 
              may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and 
              message. Please review each service prior to use and only uses those 
              that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing.</p>
            <p class="headertext">Use of Cookies</p>
            <p>What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web 
              site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping 
              purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your 
              preferences while you're at our site. We never save passwords or 
              credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry 
              standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites.</p>
            <p>By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see 
              which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and 
              updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors 
              and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. 
              We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored 
              to our users needs.</p>
            <p>Darkblue.com has two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use 
              them to specify unique preferences. For example, in Darkblue.com's 
              Business Centre, users can specify listings across several news 
              topics. This way you don't have to tell us over and over again about 
              the kinds of news stories you want to see. Secondly, we use cookies 
              to track user trends and patterns. This helps us better understand 
              and improve areas of the Darkblue.com service that our users find 
              valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a 
              "cookie," visitors to Darkblue.com always have the option 
              of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. Information 
              from cookies is sometimes attached to messages sent to our Customer 
              Service department.</p>
            <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset 
              your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is 
              being sent. However, note that some parts of the Darkblue.com service 
              will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you 
              refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able 
              to set personalized news preferences or you may have difficulty 
              completing shopping transactions, entering contests, or playing 
              games.</p>
            <p>You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. Darkblue.com 
              does not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent 
              by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.</p>
            <p class="headertext">Links to Other Sites</p>
            <p>Users should be aware that when you are on Darkblue.com, you could 
              be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are 
              links to other sites from Darkblue.com pages that take you outside 
              our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement 
              or an Darkblue.com category listing, the "click" takes 
              you off the Darkblue.com site. This includes links from advertisers, 
              Center sponsors, affiliates and partners that may use Darkblue.com's 
              logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send 
              their own cookies to users collect data or solicit personal information.</p>
            <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information 
              online --- for example, via message boards or chat --- that information 
              can be collected and used by people you don't know. While Darkblue.com 
              strives to protect its user's personal information and privacy, 
              we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose 
              online and you do so at your own risk.</p>
            <p>Darkblue.com's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent 
              in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Darkblue.com's 
              control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable 
              law or governmental regulation.</p>
            <p class="headertext">Your Acceptance of These Terms</p>
            <p>By using this site, you signify your assent to the Darkblue.com 
              Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not 
              use our sites. Your continued use of the Darkblue.com sites following 
              the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those 
              changes.</p>
            <p></p>
