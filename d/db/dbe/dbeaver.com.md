# Privacy policy – DBeaver

We believe that the personal information you provide to us must be both kept private, and used in a responsible fashion. Therefore, we consistently put our best efforts towards achieving both these objectives. 

###### Types and Reasons for Data Collection

DBeaver requires that users provide information requested in the registration screens for reasons specified in the user registration agreement. This information is essential to us properly organize our service. As more functionality is added to the site, we will continue to develop mechanisms and policies that best address participants’ preferences related to information collection and use.
