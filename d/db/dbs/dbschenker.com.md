The protection of your personal data is important to you - and for us as well. 

Because of that, we will inform you on this page about which data we collect, why we need this data and how you can contradict the data collection.   


#### 

Schenker AG is the party responsible for collecting and processing your data. The appointed data protection officer is Mr. Maik Goehrke. If you have any questions, suggestions and/or criticism in relation to data protection, please contact:

#### 

All data collection and processing is performed for specific purposes. These may result from technical necessities, contractual requirements, or explicit customer requests. For technical reasons, certain data might be collected and stored during a visit to dbschenker.com. As for example the date and duration of the visit, the web pages used, the identification data of the browser and operating system type used, and the website from which you visit us.

If you register for one of our newsletter, the following required information is collected: Salutation, first name, last name, E-Mail address, industry you are working in.  
In this case, we may use your e-mail address for promotional purposes.

If you sign up for our newsletter “logistics NewsFeed”, we save the IP address of the computer system assigned to you by your Internet service provider (ISP) and the date and time of registration. We save this data to track (potential) abuse of the email address of a data subject, for our own legal protection. You can deregister from the newsletter at any time under [unsubscribe "logistics NewsFeed"](http://seu2.cleverreach.com/f/98765-110554/) or by clicking the deregister link at the end of your newsletter.  
If you object to the promotional use of your data, your data will only be used anonymized, for statistical analysis purposes.

To continuously improve our offerings, we save and analyze usage data from the online area on a pseudonymized basis. The legal basis for this is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.

To the extent that we request consent to process your personal data, it serves as the legal basis according to Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.

For processing of personal data required to fulfill a contract with you, the contract is the legal basis according to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Article 6(1)(b) GDPR also applies to processing operations that are required to execute preliminary measures, for example, if you ask about our products or services.

If our company is subject to legal demands that require us to process personal data, for example, to fulfill tax responsibilities, then processing is based on Article 6(1)(c) GDPR.

If you click on a link to an external page, you will move outside the pages of dbschenker.com. Schenker AG is therefore not responsible for the content, services or products offered on the linked website and also for the privacy and technical safety on the linked website.

#### 

Your data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for the purpose for which they were collected (e.g. within the framework of a contractual relationship). Your data must also be deleted if it is not permissible to store them (particularly if the data are inaccurate and correction is not possible). Where legal or practical obstacles prevent deletion, the data are blocked (e.g. special archiving obligations).

#### 

The transmission of data and emails via the internet is generally unencrypted, and is therefore unprotected against third-party access. When you contact us by email, the confidentiality of the information provided cannot be guaranteed during the transmission; we therefore recommend that confidential information should be sent exclusively by letter.

#### 

  * You can request information about what data is stored about you.
  * You may request rectification, deletion and limitation of the processing (blocking) of your personal data as long as this is legally permissible and possible within the framework of an existing contractual relationship
  * You have the right to appeal to a supervisory authority. The supervisory authority responsible for the Schenker AG is: Landesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen Kavalleriestrasse 2-4, 402013 Duesseldorf   
[poststelle@ldi.nrw.de](mailto:poststelle@ldi.nrw.de)
  * You have the right to transfer the data that you have provided us on the basis of a consent or a contract (data portability).
  * If you have given us consent for data processing, you can revoke it at any time in the same way that you have granted it. The revocation of the consent does not affect the legality of the processing due to the consent until the revocation.
  * To exercise your rights, send an email to: [dataprotection@dbschenker.com](mailto:dataprotection@dbschenker.com)



#### 

For the execution of the contract, the activation of instructions-dependent processors is usually a must, such as data center operators, printing or shipping service providers or other parties involved in the performance of the contract.

External service providers, who process data for us, are carefully selected by us and are strictly contractually obligated. The service providers work according to our instructions, which is ensured by strict contractual regulations, by technical and organisational measures and by supplementary controls.

Furthermore, your data will only be transmitted if you have given us your express consent or because of a legal regulation.

Transmission to third countries outside the EU/EEA or to an international organisation shall not take place unless there are adequate guarantees. These include the EU standard contractual clauses and an adequacy decision of the European Commission.
