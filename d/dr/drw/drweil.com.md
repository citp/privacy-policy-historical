**Privacy Policy**

This web site is maintained by Hygeia, Inc. and/or its third party contractors (collectively, "Hygeia"). This site collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. An adult user's personally identifying information will not be transferred to any third party unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. 

A user's personally identifying information may be used by Hygeia for editorial purposes. Hygeia may also use such information provided by adult users for promotional and marketing purposes. Individuals have the ability to stop their information from being used for marketing and promotional purposes by sending an e-mail request to Hygeia at no_promote@drweil.com. Any personally identifying information collected by this site from children is used for editorial participation and feedback purposes, together with any other purposes that will be described where the information is collected, and will not be transferred to any third party. 

This web site places a "cookie" in the browser files of the user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. Although the cookie could enable Hygeia to relate a user's use of this site to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided, Hygeia does not do so for any kids sites. 

Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. 

KIDS: Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself to us or anyone else over the Internet. 

Users can send e-mail to us at [privacy@drweil.com](mailto:privacy@drweil.com) with any further questions.
