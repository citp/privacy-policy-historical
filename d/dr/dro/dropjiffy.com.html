					<p>Privacy of our visitors is very important to us. We do not ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. In our services, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what is visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted. This privacy policy document outlines the types of personal information is received and collected by Dropjiffy.com and how it is used.</p>
					<p>Data privacy is an important integral part of our service. Dropjiffy provides its users with an infrastructure, which enables the user to temporarily save electronic files on internet servers. The files saved with Dropjiffy are treated confidentially. Dropjiffy does not provide any search function, with which Dropjiffy's infrastructure can be searched. Dropjiffy does not scan or open the files of its users. Nobody can access your files without knowledge of the complete download link.</p>
					<p>All files uploaded by users are stored on one of our servers and are permanently deleted in no more than 30 hours since its upload. Please note that access to the download links will be disabled after 24 hours of upload, but we may have to store the files for a few more hours in order to allow completion of download if someone initiated it just before the file expiry time.</p>
					<p>Like many other Web sites, Dropjiffy.com makes use of log files. We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Web pages, services and communications. This information includes your computer or digital device's IP address, access times, your browser type and language, type of operating system you use, your account activity and accessed pages. These information are logged and used by Dropjiffy.com for measuring usage. IP addresses, and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.</p>

					<p>The security of your information is important to us. We employ appropriate security measures in place to protect information collected from loss, destruction, disclosure, unauthorized access, misuse and alteration. Although we strive to protect your personal information, Dropjiffy cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
