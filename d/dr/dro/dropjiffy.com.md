# Privacy Policy - Dropjiffy - Secure and Private File Transfer

Privacy of our visitors is very important to us. We do not ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.

Dropjiffy does not scan or open the files of its users. Nobody can access your files without knowledge of the complete download link.

All files uploaded by users are stored on one of our servers and are permanently deleted in no more than 30 hours since its upload. Please note that access to the download links will be disabled after 24 hours of upload, but we may have to store the files for a few more hours in order to allow completion of download if someone initiated it just before the file expiry time.
