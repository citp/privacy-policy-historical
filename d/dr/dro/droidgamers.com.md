If the information we need to send you your winning(s) from a contest or a product(s) you've purchased isn't available through your account, we will ask you for it at the time of winning/purchase. If it is available, we will notify you in some form to make sure the information in your account is correct so we can deliver whatever goods you are entitled to at that time.

We do not sell, trade, share or transfer any of your personal information to outside parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
