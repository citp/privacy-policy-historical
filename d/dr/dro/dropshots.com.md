# DropShots Privacy Policy

### Your Privacy is Our Priority!

  


#### DropShots Honors and Values Your Trust.

We value your trust - Which is why we have taken great care to detail exactly how we handle the personal information you provide to us in the course of using our website, purchasing our products or using our services.

#### DropShots is Committed to Your Privacy and Security.

We use our best efforts to maintain the personal information you give to us in a secure, safe and responsible manner. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, the personal information we collect will not be sold, rented or leased.

#### DropShots Mission and Credo

DropShots seeks to be your most important resource for sharing memories and staying in touch with family and friends. We are committed to quality, integrity and excellence in all that we do and deliver.

#### You Are In Control

It is up to you whether you provide us with your personal information by participating in any of the activities mentioned in this Privacy Policy. If you choose to participate, your personal information will be carefully handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

#### The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when purchasing a subscription. This allows us to process your subscription and activate your account. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that purchase.

We use the information you provide about someone else when purchasing only to process the transaction. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. When you place orders we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. We will only release or use account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (I) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of DropShots, our users, or others.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. We may use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to our Website, new DropShots services, and special offers we believe you will find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, you can opt-out at any time. Every promotion is sent with explicit opt-out instructions.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses

#### Personal Information.

When you purchase products and/or services from our web site, through the mail, or over the phone, as well as when you participate in our surveys, occasional sweepstakes or promotions and/or perks program, you provide us with information. Depending upon what information you provide to us and whether, and where, you purchase products and/or services, the information we receive may include your name, mailing, billing and/or shipping address, telephone number, birth date, form of payment, e-mail address, profile information, product and service preferences, what you purchased and where (i.e., store location, catalog and/or website). If you use a credit or debit card or pay by check, the information we receive will include your account number and your form of payment. DropShots uses the information you provide to service your account, to ship an order to you, to provide warranty service on products and/or services you purchased, and to personalize your experience.

#### Product and Service Preferences.

You have the option within the website or when ordering by phone, to provide us with information about your product and/or service preferences, profile information or other interests. You may also provide us with product and service preference information when you participate in our DropShots perks program, sweepstakes, surveys and questionnaires. We use this information to improve the level of customization of our services and website and to provide better recommendations for you.

#### E-mail and Direct Mail Offers.

To present to you other useful and valuable products we may also use your mailing, shipping and/or billing address or e-mail address you have provided us to send you special offers from time to time that would be of interest to you.

#### Surveys.

From time to time, we may randomly contact customers about participating in a survey about our products, services and/or website. Your feedback helps us identify customer needs, levels of satisfaction, and improve and/or develop new products and services for you and your family. These surveys are always voluntary.

#### DropShots Contests, Promotions, Advertisements and Other Opportunities.

If you enter a DropShots contest and/or sweepstakes, we will ask for your name, mailing address, e-mail address and any other information relevant to the particular offer. Unless otherwise noted on the offer, the information you provide us will be kept exclusively by DropShots.

#### Contests, Promotions, Advertisements and Other Opportunities Provided With Select Third Parties. 

DropShots may run contests, sweepstakes, advertisements and other promotional offers with select companies outside of the DropShots website, by e-mail, through our catalogs or by direct mail. When you choose to participate in these contests, sweepstakes or promotional offers, you may be asked to give the third parties your personal information. These businesses operate independently from DropShots. Any personal information that is given to them is at your option and is not controlled by our Privacy Policy. To avoid confusion, we will identify these businesses as independent from DropShots. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these businesses if you should have any concerns about how they will treat your personal information.

#### Research Providers, Shipping Companies, and Consultants.

DropShots hires selective companies to do product and service research, deliver merchandise you have purchased from us, help us be a better, more effective and efficient company, and/or develop new and /or better products and/or services for you. We also share sales information with third parties to properly process services and returns, place new supplier orders and perform other administrative functions.

#### Legal Requirements.

On rare occasions, we may be required to disclose personal information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or as required by applicable laws. Also, if the ownership of DropShots were to change, customer information pertinent to that business's operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner.

#### Change Happens.

DropShots is continually improving its services, offerings, and products to you. This includes adding new functionality and features to its websites and/or catalogs. Because of these changes, changes in technology and/or the law, this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We encourage you to review it each time you visit our website or order by phone to make sure you understand our current practices and policies.
