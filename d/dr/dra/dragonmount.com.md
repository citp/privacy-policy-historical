Your privacy is critically important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available in our footer and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

This website does not store any information that would, on its own, allow us to identify individual users of this service without their permission.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by emailing our staff. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 

In order to better prevent spam, and to help ensure only authentic users register for our services, we have implemented the IPS Spam Defense Service. The email address and IP address of each registering member is passed to the service to determine the likelihood a registering account is a spam source. Data from accounts determined not to be spammers are permanently deleted within 48 hours. Data from accounts determined to be spammers may be stored indefinitely to create a block list. 

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us an email at [webmaster@dragonmount.com](mailto:webmaster@dragonmount.com).
