The following Privacy Policy will provide you information about the personal data that is collected and how it is processed and used.<br><br><b>Subject matter of this Privacy Policy</b><br>This Privacy Policy applies to all services which are offered on Shanda Internet pages, in particular the Shanda portal and the individual online gaming sites. Unless stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy exclusively regulates how Shanda treats your personal data. In case you make use of services provided by third parties, the privacy policies of these third parties apply exclusively. Shanda does not revise privacy policies of third parties.<br><br><b>Data controller</b><br>The data controller according to the Federal Data Protection Act is Shanda Frankfurt Straße 63-69, 65760 Eschborn.

If the consent is declared electronically within the scope of our Internet presence, we will comply with the statutory obligations to inform you about it.<br><br><b>Collection of data to implement the contract</b><br>Generally, you can access our Internet presence without disclosing any personal data to us. It is always your choice whether or not to provide us with your personal data. We collect your data to be able to fulfill the user contract concluded with you.

The proper implementation of the user contract involves in particular the monitoring of compliance with the terms of use and the rules of the game. Insofar as we provide you clients for download to participate in our games, a program to avoid altering or fraudulent interventions in the game may be installed in the game along with these clients to prevent unlawful use of the game and manipulation of data. <br><br>Such programs are started together with the respective game and exclusively serve to protect the data of the respective game stored on the clients and the servers.
