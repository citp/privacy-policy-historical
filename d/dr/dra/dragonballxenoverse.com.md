**Question 10  
What security measures does BANDAI NAMCO take to ensure the confidentiality of my personal information?**

BANDAI NAMCO acknowledges that all personal data are subject to compliance with the legal framework applicable to the security of personal data.

BANDAI NAMCO undertakes to take the necessary measures to ensure the security of the processing of personal data in compliance with data protection regulations.

Maintaining the security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented administrative, physical and technical security measures, with regard to the nature of the data we process and the risks of the processing, to preserve the security of the data and, in particular, prevent their alteration and damage, or access by non-authorised third parties. We also carry out periodic reviews of our security procedures with a view to implementing new and updated technologies where appropriate. However, despite the wide range of initiatives and measures in place, no security protocol is perfect, infallible or impenetrable.

If BANDAI NAMCO subcontracts all or part of the processing of personal data to processors, BANDAI NAMCO will require that its processors provide contractual guarantees on the security and confidentiality of personal data by means of technical data protection measures and appropriate human resources.

You also have a role to play in keeping your personal information safe. If you are asked to create a unique password to secure access to your account, choose one that would be impossible to guess and make sure you never share it with anyone. It is your responsibility to ensure your password and account information is always confidential. If you use a public or shared computer, turn off all settings and options that remember your login credentials and ensure you always log out of your account before leaving the computer.

**Question 11  
How can I update or change my login information and profile?**

Our websites allow you to access your login details (through the areas called "My Account", "My Profile", "My Settings" or similar names) and we may offer various options for updating your account and personal details within it. If these options are not offered on the website you are visiting, or if the request or change you want to make is not offered in these account management areas, you have several courses of action available to you:

  * **Opting out of BANDAI NAMCO communication and marketing** – When registering or sending information, you may be given the option to subscribe to BANDAI NAMCO communication and marketing by ticking the box provided. Some initiatives or registrations may automatically generate certain messages (including marketing communication) when you send personal information (e.g. an email address in a registration form used for this sole purpose) or as part of performing an action that involves receiving messages (e.g. setting up a profile in your BANDAI NAMCO account). Our marketing communications also come with the option to opt out of all future marketing communications of the same type (e.g. option to unsubscribe). You just need to follow the steps to unsubscribe or the instructions contained in the marketing communication. Please note that even if you opt out of all marketing communication from BANDAI NAMCO, you may still receive communication from us, such as product news, account information and mandatory messages. You may also receive messages related to BANDAI NAMCO from friends or family members through their use of referral and sharing features or any other similar website service.
