                          DragonFable has a large portion of the game available
                            to the users for free. In order to register a character
                            for the free version of the game, the only information
                            that DragonFable collects is the user’s e-mail
                            address. The e-mail address is used for the following
                            purposes:<br>
                          1. To send a confirmation notice to the user of their

                          the password.<br>
                          3. In response to any question, concerns or problem
                          that the user contacted DragonFable about. <br>
                          4.	To contact the user about any problem with the user’s
                          account or conduct in the game.<br>
                        5.	To send out a newsletter*.</p>
                        <p>* DragonFable game is unique in a sense that we design
                          and run numerous special events that keep the game
                          constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting
                          for our users. Some of these events coincide with actual
                          real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day,
                          other events are made up as we go along. We use the
                          newsletter to notify our users of all the current events,
                          changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc.
                          In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of
                          new products and services that DragonFable has designed
                          and made available exclusively to our users. In addition,
                          DragonFable may send promotional items and advertisements
                          from the sponsors, however DragonFable will not divulge
                          your personal information to the sponsor directly.</p>

                          A Subscriber Account is a paid membership account
                          that provides our users with additional access and
                          privileges while playing DragonFable. The Subscriber
                          Account requires and uses all of the information listed
                          under the Free Account in the same manner. In addition
                          to the above, however, we will require you to provide

                          information for the sole purpose of verifying your
                          account and payment information.</p>
                        <p><span class="subheader">What We WILL NOT DO With Your Personal Information<a name="2"></a></span><br>
                          DragonFable does not sell or knowingly divulge your
                          personal information to advertisers or any other third
                          parties, unless we are required to share your information
                          with a third party in order to comply with law, to
                          comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our
                          site or game rules; to protect the safety and security
                        of our users and our Web sites.</p>

                          A cookie is a little piece of information handed
                          to a web browser to a web server that contains information
                          that can be retrieved from the server later. DragonFable
                          uses cookies only to the limited extent of recognizing
                          the registered user and pairing that user with the
                          character that the user created and the account preferences
                        set by that user within the game.<br>

                          The DragonFable message board is a place for users
                          of the game to interact by posting messages. The message
                          board must be signed up for separately from the game
                        and is subject to TERMS OF USE. </p>

                          DragonFable does not process your payments directly.
                          Instead we contract this service to PayPal. Founded
                          in 1998, PayPal, an eBay Company, enables any individual
                          or business with an email address to securely, easily
                          and quickly send and receive payments online. To find

                          <span class="subheader">CHILDRENS’S PRIVACY POLICY<a name="7"></a></span><br>
                          DragonFable encourages parents and legal guardians
                          to spend time online with their children. We urge parents
                          and legal guardians to instruct their children to never
                          give out their personal information online without
                          permission. We also recognize a special need to protect
                          personal information obtained from children. In compliance
                          with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
                          (“COPPA”), we have adopted the following
                        policies regarding children under the age of 14 (“Children”):</p>
                        <p> <strong>Type and Use of Information Collected from Children</strong><br>
                        Parents of children under the age of 13 who wish to allow their children access to the Site or Services must create an account on behalf of their child. When you create a child’s account, you certify that you are at least 18 years old and that you are the legal guardian of the child using the account. Accordingly, as the legal guardian, it is your responsibility to determine whether any of the Service areas and/or Content are appropriate for your child. By creating a child’s account, you also give your child permission to access many areas of the Service, including email and message boards (among others). By creating a child’s account, you do not give your child permission to purchase account upgrades or other items by credit card or any other means. To purchase account upgrades or other products, you must represent that you are at least 18 years old. When you purchase account upgrades or other products on behalf of a child under the age of 18, you certify that you are at least 18 years old and that you are the legal guardian of the child. </p>
                        <p>To create a Subscriber Account, DragonFable does require an e-mail address
  as well as the parent’s correct billing information as outlined under
  the Subscriber Accounts section. The setting up of the account by the parents
  is considered an actual verifiable consent by the parent for the child to use
  this website as required by COPPA.<br>
  <br>
  For Subscriber Accounts, we use your child’s e-mail address for the following
  purposes:<br>
  1. To send a confirmation notice to the child of their
                          character registration and password information.<br>
                          2.	Upon the child’s request, to send the user
                          password information when the child has lost or forgotten
                          the password.<br>

                          real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day,
                          other events are made up as we go along. We use the
