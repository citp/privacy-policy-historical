</p>
<h3>Use of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>
Drawception collects and uses your In-Game Actions to operate and improve the Drawception Games and better deliver the Services. These uses may include performing analysis aimed at improving the Service; making the Drawception Games or Services more user friendly; and displaying advertising and content that are tailored to your preferences and interests.  Drawception will not use, display, or share any of your In-Game Actions or your Information in a manner inconsistent with the privacy settings on your Facebook Account and/or Section 9 of Facebook’s Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (currently accessible at http://www.facebook.com/terms.php).
</p>
<p>
We may also use your Information (e.g., name, email address and other Information) to notify you of new releases, notifications, and to solicit your comments and feedback.  Any such emails will include an “unsubscribe” link should you decide you do not want to receive further such emails.
</p>
<p>
In-Game Actions and/or Information collected on Drawception sites and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Drawception or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using a Drawception site or service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. 
</p>
<p>
You understand and agree that Drawception may access, maintain, archive and disclose any Information we may have about you and the contents of your Drawception account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, maintenance, archival or disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order), to avoid liability, or to protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates or the public. Drawception is not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that Drawception receives.
</p>
<h3>Sharing of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>
Except as described in this Privacy Notice, your Information will be used only by Drawception and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates, and such information will not be disclosed to any other third party without your consent.  Drawception occasionally hires other companies to provide limited administrative and communication services on our behalf, such as providing customer support in connection with the Drawception Games, or performing statistical analysis of the Services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only such Information from you as necessary for them to deliver the service. Those companies are required to maintain the confidentiality of the Information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

</p>
<p>
In some cases, Drawception may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Drawception, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

<p>
