## 1\. The information we collect about you

**What is personal information?**

Personal Information is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. We do not consider personal information to include information that can no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.

We collect information from you both when you provide it voluntarily and also automatically when you use our Services. We may also collect personal information from other sources, as described below.

For more information about the personal information we collect, read on below.

We collect personal information from you and any devices (including mobile devices) you use when you: use our Services, register for an account with us, make a purchase, provide us information on a web form, engage or connect with us through one of our social media pages, update or add information to your account, chat with a customer support specialist, or when you otherwise correspond with us.

In addition, we also collect personal information about you from third parties in connection with our Services, including from the following sources:

  1.     1.       * E-commerce service providers
      * Email, chat and other communications service providers
      * Customer service providers
      * Data analytics service providers
      * Advertising providers
      * Social media platforms



For more information about the types of your personal information we may use, see the detailed descriptions below.

#### _General Personal Data_

We may use the following categories of personal information in connection with your use of our Services:

  1.     1.       * Personal contact details, such as name, title, addresses, telephone numbers, and personal email addresses

      * Computer and connection information such as statistics on your page views, traffic to and from the sites, referral URL, ad data, your IP address, your browsing history, and your web log information



#### _Special Categories of Data_

We never request or require you to provide any of the following special categories of data, but through our chat services and customer services interactions, we know that sometimes customers and users of the Services choose on their own to share the following kinds of personal information with us:

  1.     1.       * Information about your race or ethnicity, religious beliefs, sexual orientation and political opinions
      * Information about your health, including any medical conditions, diagnoses and/or injuries



**Again, we will never request or require this type of information! But if you decide to share it with us, our business partners who provide tools to support our chat and customer service interactions generally maintain a copy of transcripts and recordings for all customer service transactions, but we do not use or disclose it for any purposes other than resolving or analyzing complaints, suggestions or issues brought to our attention by you.**

#### _Other Information We Collect About You_

  1.     1.       * **Cookies.** Our Services use “cookies” and similar technologies. Cookies are small text files sent by your computer or device each time you visit our Services, which are unique to your account, browser or device. Cookies make web surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use these to improve your next visit to our Services – for example, remembering your login information. Cookies help us learn which areas of our Services are useful and which areas need improvement. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience with our Services may be impaired and some features may not work as they were intended. When we use cookies or other similar technologies, we may set the cookies ourselves or ask third parties to do so to help us.  
Cookies may be either persistent or temporary (or session) cookies. A persistent cookie retains user preferences for a particular website allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions and remains valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date). A temporary cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
      * **Pixels, Beacons.** We or third party ad servers may use invisible pixels or beacons on the Services to count how many users visit certain pages or content. This information is collected and reported in the aggregate. We may use this information to improve our marketing programs and content, and to target advertisements to you.
      * **Other Non-Personal Information.** In addition to personal information you choose to provide us or that is automatically collected by us and our third-party service providers when you use the Services, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies to automatically collect certain usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Services. This information may include browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, the source of the request, the preceding page view, and other similar information (collectively, “ **Usage Information** ”).



## 2\. How we may use information about you

We will only use your personal information for the purposes identified below, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose described here. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Some of your personal information, such as a way to identify you, is necessary to enter into our [Terms of Use](https://draxe.com/terms-of-use/) or other agreement we have with you. The provision of all other personal information is voluntary, but may be necessary in order to use our Services, such as registering and viewing a webinar or receiving support and customer service through customer support chat.

#### _General Personal Data_

In general, your personal information may be used for the following purposes:

  1.     1.       * In connection with our provision of Services to you, which may include the following:

        * Operating and improving our Services
        * Managing your rewards account
      * For us to comply with our legal obligations, including assessing compliance with our regulatory requirements (e.g., using customer order information in the aggregate, including revenues generated in connection with our regulatory tax requirements).
      * For our other legitimate interests to make available and highlight content and opportunities that are relevant to you, improve our Services, maintain our relationship with you, and protect users of our Services and customers, where your rights and freedoms do not outweigh these interests.  We both benefit when we use your information to:

        * Offer new features, programs and opportunities 
        * Decide which ads to show you by only showing you those that “match” your past viewing, browsing and shopping activity. Many advertising services collect and use data from your web and mobile app activity both on and off the Services to help show you ads that are more targeted to your interests
        * Contact you via email or postal mail in order to offer you coupons, discounts and special promotions, poll your opinions through surveys or questionnaires and inform you about our Services, as authorized by applicable law

        * Measure the performance of our email marketing campaigns (e.g. by analyzing open and click rates)
        * Contact you regarding your account or an order, to troubleshoot problems with your account or an order, to resolve a dispute, to collect fees or monies owed or as otherwise necessary to provide you customer service
        * Monitor and improve the information security of our websites
        * Keeping our Services safe, secure and operational
        * Prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraud, security breaches or other potentially prohibited or illegal activities
        * Customizing content that includes items and services that you may like in response to actions that you take
        * Provide other services requested by you as described when we collect the information
        * Conduct analytics on who is using the Services and what they are doing. For example, by reviewing how often people read certain content, we can learn and understand which content is most valuable and helpful to you and others
        * Use your geo-location to provide location based services
    2.       * With your consent, we may use your personal information to:
        * Provide you with marketing via telephone calls, email, SMS or text
        * Provide you with marketing from third parties



We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:

  1.     1.       * Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests).
      * Where it is needed in the public interest.



#### _Special Categories of Data_

Notwithstanding the above, we will only use the “special categories” of data described in the “ ** _The Information we collect about you_** ” section above in very limited circumstances and only with your express consent or, less commonly, we may use this type of data where it is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is needed to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public.

We will never ask you for such special categories of information, but if you provide it to us in your communications with us, such as, for instance, in customer support chats, we and our third party service providers who we employ to assist us manage customer- and visitor-provided requests and communications will store, but not otherwise use or disclose, such information in accordance with our standard data retention policies. 

**If you do not wish for us to have such special categories of personal information, please do not disclose it to us.**

#### _Other Information We Collect About You_

  1.     1.       * **Cookies and Tracking Technologies.**
        * We use cookies and other tracking technologies to assist you navigating and using our Services, analyzing your use of our Services, and assisting with our promotional and marketing efforts (including advertising to you based upon your interests).
        * We may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use our Services and other websites, apps or online services, based on information relating to your access and use of our Services and other websites, apps and services on any of your devices, as well as information received from third parties. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags). They may also use these technologies, along with information they collect about your online use, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone and a laptop.   

    2.       * **Do Not Track Signals.** At this time, we do not respond to browser ‘do not track’ signals, as there are not yet standards for how such signals should be interpreted. Third parties, including our service providers, may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites, including when you visit our website.
      * **Usage Information.** We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Services. When analyzed, Usage Information helps us determine how our Services are used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the Services, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising. We may associate your Usage Information with the personal information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as personal information.
