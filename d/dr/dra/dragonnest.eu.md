### 8\. How can you verify, modify or delete your personal information

You may verify and modify your Personal Data that we hold about you by logging into your Cherry account, or contacting our customer support via Cherry Messenger.

If we process your Personal Data, we shall endeavor to ensure by implementing suitable measures that your Personal Data is accurate and up-to-date for the purposes for which it was collected. If your Personal Data is inaccurate or incomplete, you can change the information you provided via the above two means.

You may request the deletion of Personal Data concerning you if the reason why we could collect it (see section 2 and 3 above) does not exist anymore or if there is another legal ground for its deletion. For individual items of Personal Data please edit them through your Cherry account or request the deletion via our customer support using Cherry Messenger. You are required to provide your personal identity information for the deletion request to verify that you are the genuine owner of the Cherry account.

As a result of deleting your Cherry account, you will lose access to all Cherry Credits services, including your Cherry account, e-wallet, Cherry Game accounts, game-related information linked to the Cherry account and the possibility to access other services you are using the Cherry account for.

We allow you to restore your Cherry account with a grace period of 30 (thirty) calendar days from the moment you request deletion of your Cherry account. This functionality allows you not to lose your account by mistake, because of your loss of your account credentials or due to hacking. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalize financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Cherry account deletion request. After the grace period, Personal Data associated with your account will be deleted subject to section 4. above

In some cases, deletion of your Cherry account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. Namely, if your account has a business relationship with Cherry Credits, such as due to your work for Cherry Credits or a game developer, you will only be able to delete your Cherry account after you have transferred this role to another user or have dissolved the business relationship. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than three further months.
