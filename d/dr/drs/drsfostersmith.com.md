**Secure Shopping**

All orders on our site are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - one of the most prevalent and secure systems available online. SSL is an extremely complex form of cryptography that makes it virtually impossible for a third party to decrypt any useful information you provide. You can rest assured that your personal and credit card information is protected when transmitted online. You can find detailed information about SSL technology and how it works online using any of the search engines. A good place to start is by visiting [Webopedia's discussion on SSL](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERMS/S/Secure_Socket_Layer.html). 

**Privacy Policy**

At Drs. Foster & Smith, we are committed to honoring and respecting your individual privacy. The following paragraphs describe our privacy policies regarding the personal information you provide us as well as information we collect about how our visitors use our site. 

Personal Information

Drs. Foster & Smith offers three shopping options that allow you to choose how much information you wish to share with us for your shopping convenience.

  1. Shop Anonymously - In this option, we will not save any personal information about you. The information you provide (name, address, etc.) will be used only for the order you place with us. Each time you shop anonymously, you will re-enter all your billing and shipping information.
  2. Remember Me - With this option, we will save all information you provide on the order form - except your **_credit card information_** \- so that the next time you shop with us, the billing and shipping information will be conveniently filled in for you. This will save you time during the checkout process since the only thing you will have to enter is your credit card information.
  3. Express Checkout - This option offers maximum convenience and allows you to check out with just two clicks. With Express Checkout, we will save all of the billing and shipping information you provide us, including your credit card information, to make future ordering very easy, very fast, and very convenient.

The information you provide for the Remember Me and Express Checkout options is protected by the personal password you select along with your User ID so that only you have access to your account information. 

You are free to change your shopping convenience preference at any time by clicking on the "My Account" link at the top of each page.

**Email**

We believe that your email address is private information and you have our assurance that we will not rent or sell your email address to anyone. You will have the opportunity on our site and through occasional email invitations to Opt In to our informative email newsletters as well as our periodic promotional mailings. You can easily Opt Out of any of our email lists via links in emails or on the Unsubscription Page on our site. We will always try to contact you by phone if we have a question about an order you placed. If we are unable to reach you by phone, we may also try to contact you by email.
