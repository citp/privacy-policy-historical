# Customer Service: Privacy & Security

_Drs. Foster & Smith is very sensitive to the issues of online privacy and electronic security. As we establish and maintain an online relationship with you, we want you to know we will always do whatever possible to ensure a secure and private environment to maintain your unquestioned trust._

**Privacy Policy**  
At Drs. Foster & Smith, we are committed to honoring and respecting your individual privacy. The following paragraphs describe our privacy policies regarding the personal information you provide us as well as information we collect about how our visitors use our site. 

**Personal Information**  
Drs. Foster & Smith offers three shopping options that allow you to choose how much information you wish to share with us for your shopping convenience. 

  1. **Shop Anonymously** \- None of your personal information is stored and all information you will be asked for your shipping, billing and credit card information each time you proceed through our Checkout procedure. 
  2. **Remember Me** \- We store your billing and shipping information on our secure server for your convenience. Your Bill-To and Ship-To information is pre-filled in the appropriate areas in our Checkout procedure. 
  3. **Express Checkout** \- We store your billing and shipping information, and credit card information on our secure server for your convenience. This is all pre-filled in the appropriate areas in our Checkout procedure.

The information you provide for the **Remember Me** and **Express Checkout** options is protected by the personal password you select, along with your User ID, so that only you have access to your account information. 

You are free to change your shopping convenience preference at any time by clicking on the **Your Account** link at the top of each page. 

**Email**  
We believe that your email address is private information and you have our assurance that we do not rent or sell your email address to anyone. We use your email address to send you order-related emails, like shipping confirmations, as well as informational/sale newsletters. 

_We will always try to contact you by phone if we have a question about an order you placed. If we are unable to reach you by phone, we may also try to contact you by email._

You may opt out at any time from any or ALL newsletters in the series, either [online](https://web.archive.org/newsletters/index.cfm?login) or by using the links provided in every newsletter issue. 

We use an email delivery and marketing company to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Pixel tags and cookies are used in those email messages and at our website to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising, how our visitors use our site and to enable us to provide more focused and subsequent email marketing communications to you. 

**Secure Shopping**  


[](https://www.scanalert.com/RatingVerify?ref=www.drsfostersmith.com)

All orders on our site are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - one of the most prevalent and secure systems available online. SSL is an extremely complex form of cryptography that makes it virtually impossible for a third party to decrypt any personal information you provide. You can rest assured that your personal and credit card information is protected when transmitted online. You can find detailed information about SSL technology and how it works online using any of the search engines. A good place to start is by visiting [Webopedia's discussion on SSL](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/SSL.html). 

**Better Business Bureau Accredited**

This means we meet all the standards required for membership in the Better Business Bureau, and we fully abide with the BBB Code of Online Business Practices. 

**Cookies**  
We use computer "cookies" only to assist us in identifying our valued returning customers and tracking items placed in their shopping carts. We store an identification number in your cookie that is only significant to DrsFosterSmith.com. No personal information is stored in your cookie. If you attempt to shop and have cookies disabled, we will not be able to remember items you have placed in your shopping cart. 

**JavaScript**  
We use JavaScript for many useful features such as instantly displaying backordered items, recalculating your order total when selecting a different shipping method and for displaying pop-up information for products and assistance throughout our site. Having JavaScript enabled isn't a requirement for using our site. However, these features are designed to enhance your online shopping experience and to make shopping online more convenient for you.

We use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
