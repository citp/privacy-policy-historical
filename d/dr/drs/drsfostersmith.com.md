Privacy Policy

Drs. Foster & Smith is very sensitive to the issues of online privacy and electronic security. As we establish and maintain an online relationship with you, we want you to know we will always do whatever possible to ensure a secure and private environment to maintain your unquestioned trust.

**Secure Shopping**

All orders on our site are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - one of the most prevalent and secure systems available online. SSL is an extremely complex form of cryptography that makes it virtually impossible for a third party to decrypt any personal information you provide. You can rest assured that your personal and credit card information is protected when transmitted online. You can find detailed information about SSL technology and how it works online using any of the search engines. A good place to start is by visiting [Webopedia's discussion on SSL](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/SSL.html).

**Privacy Policy**

At Drs. Foster & Smith, we are committed to honoring and respecting your individual privacy. The following paragraphs describe our privacy policies regarding the personal information you provide us as well as information we collect about how our visitors use our site.

Personal Information

Drs. Foster & Smith offers three shopping options that allow you to choose how much information you wish to share with us for your shopping convenience.

  1. **Shop Anonymously** \- If you shop Anonymously none of your information will be stored for future orders and all information will have to be provided each time you shop. As an Anonymous shopper, you will be asked for your shipping, billing and credit card information each time you proceed through our quick four-step checkout procedure.
  2. **Remember Me** \- If you choose to become a Remember Me customer we will store your billing and shipping information on our secure server for your convenience. As a Remember Me customer your Bill To and Ship To information will be pre-filled in the appropriate areas in our four-step checkout procedure. You will be able to store up to four different Ship To addresses, which you may quickly select from during checkout. Credit card information is not stored for a Remember Me customer, and must be filled in on a per-order basis.
  3. **Express Checkout** \- As an Express Checkout customer you will enjoy the most convenient ordering experience available at DrsFosterSmith.Com. We will ask you for your shipping, billing and credit card information only once so that you will be able to go directly from your Shopping Cart to Final Checkout in One Click! You will be able to store up to four credit cards and four Ship To addresses on our secure server.



The information you provide for the Remember Me and Express Checkout options is protected by the personal password you select along with your User ID so that only you have access to your account information.

You are free to change your shopping convenience preference at any time by clicking on the "My Account" link at the top of each page.

**E-mail**

We believe that your e-mail address is private information and you have our assurance that we will not rent or sell your e-mail address to anyone. You will have the opportunity on our site and through occasional e-mail invitations to opt in to our informative e-mail newsletters as well as our periodic promotional mailings. You can easily opt out of any of our e-mail lists via links in e-mails or on the Unsubscribe Page on our site. We will always try to contact you by phone if we have a question about an order you placed. If we are unable to reach you by phone, we may also try to contact you by e-mail.
