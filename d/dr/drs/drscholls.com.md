Bayer is aware that the security of your private information from the use of our websites, mobile apps or other online services (“Website”) is an important concern. We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Therefore we would like you to know what data we maintain and what data we discard. With this privacy statement, we would like to inform you about our security measures.

## Collection of Data

You can use many features of our Website without disclosing your personal data. You are not required to provide personal information as a condition of using our Website, except as may be necessary to provide you a product or service at your request; these products or services may include some of our apps or online services, such as those providing premium content or exclusive offers. When you use our Website, certain data may be stored for various purposes, including security, site functionality, analytics and marketing purposes. This data may include the name of your internet service provider, the website that you used to link to our Website, the websites that you visit from our Website and your IP-Address or device identifier. This data could possibly lead to your identification, but we do not use it to do so or combine it with personal information without your consent. We do use the data from time to time for statistical purposes, but maintain the anonymity of each individual user so that the person cannot be identified. If you elect to participate in certain analytics, communications and marketing programs, including those operated or run by third parties, we may also enhance personal data by obtaining or merging personal data with technical, cookie or other data we collect or that we receive from third parties; we would use this enhanced data to create a more complete profile for a more customized user experience. In cases when personal data is provided to others to provide you products or services you have requested, or for other purposes you have authorized, we rely on technical and organizational means to assure that applicable data security regulations are followed.

## Collection and processing of personal data

We collect personal data only when you provide it to us, through registration, completion of forms or e-mails, as part of an order for products or services, inquiries or requests about materials being ordered and similar situations in which you have chosen to provide the information to us.

The personal data you disclose to us remains at our company and/or with data processors or servers acting on our behalf and responsible to us. We may disclose the personal data we collect to third party service providers in connection with services that they perform for us, such as running and fulfilling promotions, conducting surveys, and e-mail and direct mail delivery services. Your personal data will not otherwise be passed on by us or by our agents for use by third parties in any form whatsoever, unless we have obtained your consent, are legally required to do so such as to comply with law or a legal request such as a subpoena, to protect the company’s rights, property or interests, or in the event of a sale of assets or other corporate restructuring.

We will retain control of and responsibility for the use of any personal data you disclose to us. Some of this data may be stored or processed at computers located in other jurisdictions whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live. In such cases, we will ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the data that are equivalent to those that apply in the country in which you live. 

## Purposes of Use

The personal data we collect will only be used for the purpose of supplying you with the requested products or services or for other purposes for which you have given your consent, except where otherwise provided by law.

## Right of Access and Correction

## Use of Cookies and other Tracking Technologies

This website uses so-called “ ** _Cookies_**.” Cookies are small text files that are stored on your hard drive through the visitor's local browser cache. Using such cookies it is possible to recognize the visitor's browser in order to optimize the website and simplify its use. Data collected via cookies will not be used to determine the personal identity of the website visitor.

Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol is not yet established, Bayer’s information collection and disclosure practices and the choices it offers to consumers will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy regardless of a “do not track” choice made by the consumer.

Most browsers are set-up to accept Cookies automatically. In addition, you can deactivate the storing of cookies or adjust your browser to inform you before the Cookie is stored on your computer. In the case of third-party Cookies for interest-based advertising, you can opt out of receiving interest-based ads by visiting the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

We use cookies for two main purposes: (1) cookies to facilitate technical aspects or special features on our site, without which the functionality of our website would be reduced, and (2) cookies for analytics and marketing purposes.

The lifespan of these cookies range from deletion at the end of a browser session to up to 60 days for preference settings, and some cookies may persist for up to one year.

The data collected via a cookie may be used to gather statistical information or technical information like day and time of your visit as well as device type or browser used to access our site.

The preference data we collect could include information like region, language or user name to be able to provide you a more personalized experience and deliver content more relevant to your interests. While we do leverage the information we collect in aggregate to deliver more relevant advertisements and offers to you on other third party websites as you navigate the Internet, we do not share your personal information with any third party vendor or website owner for their own marketing purposes.
