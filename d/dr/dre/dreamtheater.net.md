**Other Information We May Collect**

We may also collect any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual, such as browser information, information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, demographic information, other information provided by you, and aggregated information (“Other Information”).

**How We Collect Other Information**

We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to:

Through Your Browser or Device: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version, device manufacturer and model, language and Internet browser type and version. We use this information to ensure that the Site functions properly.

Cookies: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Site, pages visited, language preferences and other anonymous traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while visiting the Site, as well as for online tracking purposes. We also use cookies to gather statistical information about the use of the Site in order to continually improve its design and functionality, understand how it is used and assist us with resolving questions about it. Cookies further allow us to select which of our content, advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Site. We may also use cookies in online advertising to track responses to our advertisements.

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). If you choose to decline cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Site, and some or all of the features, functionality and promotions available through the Site may not be available to you.

We may use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect information about Site use anonymously and reports website trends, without identifying individual visitors. We also use an enhancement to Google Analytics called “Demographics and Interest Reporting,” through which Google provides us with information about Site users’ demographics (e.g., age, gender) and interests. This information, which Google may collect by tracking a user’s behaviour across third-party websites, helps us to learn more about our users. You can learn about Google’s practices in connection with this enhanced tracking and opt out of it by visiting <http://www.google.com/settings/ads> or by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.

Pixel Tags and Similar Technologies: Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates.

IP Address: Your IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider. An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems and administering the Site.

From You: We collect other information, such as your preferred means of communication, when you voluntarily provide it. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you.

By Aggregating Information: Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you (for example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).

**How We Use and Disclose Other Information**

We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then, in addition to the uses listed in the How We Collect Other Information section above, we may use and disclose Other Information for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information. If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site to which this Site contains a link. The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our affiliates.
