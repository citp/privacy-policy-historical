**13\. Cookies, web beacons and IP address**

A cookie is a piece of data stored locally on your computer, which contains information about your activities on the Internet. The information in a cookie does not contain any personally identifiable information you submit to the Platform. 

On the Platform, we use cookies to track users’ progress through the Platform, allowing us to make improvements based on usage data. We also use cookies if you log in to the Platform to enable you to remain logged in. A cookie helps you to get the best out of the Platform and helps us to provide you with a more customised Service. 

Once you close your browser, our access to the cookie terminates. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. To change your browser settings, you should go to your advanced preferences. 

If you continue to use our Platform we assume you agree to our use of cookies as described above. 

If you choose not to accept the cookies, this will not affect your access to the majority of information available on the Platform. However, you will not be able to make full use of our online Services and even log-in into your Account and use your Personal Data therefrom, but however you will be able to browse through the website and see public pages thereon. 

A web beacon, also referred to as a clear gif or page tag, consists of code on the Platform that delivers a small graphic image from another website or third-party server. They may not be visible as the beacon is generally a 1x1 pixel that is often designed to blend into the background of a webpage. 

We use web beacons, often in conjunction with cookies, to monitor the effectiveness of ad banners; and to gather general log, statistical, and referral information. We do not use beacons to store or link to Personal Data. We thus use beacons to understand certain actions that you took (such as a purchase), but not to identify you. 

Please note, any interaction with the Platform may reveal your Internet protocol (IP) address. We may use your (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our Platform, to administer the Platform, or to gather demographic information about our Users. Your IP address may also be used to assist in the detection of fraud and we may pass this information to the legal bodies for that purpose. 

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or would like to have access to your data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at [support@dreamteam.gg](mailto:support@dreamteam.gg). 

Thank you!
