When you submit a question to customer service, we may need your email address or telephone number to respond, and you may also provide us with additional information to help us answer your question. dressbarn social networking or mobile applications may also provide dressbarn with information contained within your mobile device or your social network account, such as your profile information, friend or contacts information, pictures, and interests. You may choose not to provide certain information; however, choosing to do so may prevent you from being able to take advantage of many of our Sites' features, from conducting transactions, or from using the application.

Whenever you browse dressbarn.com or other websites operated by us, dressbarn automatically receives and records information such as your IP address, browser type, domain name and specific dressbarn.com web pages through which you click. We may maintain a record of your product interests and the purchases you make in our stores or on-line. We may secure information about you from our joint marketing partners and/or from unrelated third parties. We may also collect demographic information, and we may use mailing lists from third parties. We may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

To provide location-based services on certain of our Sites, in particular our social networking and mobile applications, we may need to capture and record certain location-data regarding your use of the application and your travels in order to provide location-related functionality ("Location-Data"). We may link that Location-Data to other information that you provide to us or that may be accessed in connection with your use of the application. Your use of, and our ability to offer functionality through, the application is then enabled through our use of Location-Data and associated information.

**What are "cookies" and how does dressbarn use them?**  
dressbarn uses computer "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) to make your shopping experience more efficient, convenient and personalized. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that enable our systems to recognize your browser. Through the use of these cookies, dressbarn may automatically collect non-personal information and data, such as your IP address, Internet service provider, location, language, your computer software types and versions, screen resolution and colors, domain name, how you got to our Site (including key words used in a search engines), whether you are a returning or new visitor, how often you visit the Site, and specific dressbarn web pages through which you click and how long you spend on each page.

Cookies are not required for you to browse our Sites; however, they are required to add items to your shopping cart and for you to place an order. Cookies do not contain any PII. They are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our Sites' features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

**How do you use my information?**  
Our primary purpose for collecting PII is for dressbarn to provide you with a safe, efficient and beneficial experience. To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online and in our stores about your activities and product interests.

Personal information provided by you through the Sites will be used for other purposes consistent with those purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. We use information about you for various purposes, including the following:

  * To verify your identity and protect each party from errors, misuse of the Sites, fraud, or any criminal activity;
  * To respond to your inquiries;
  * To verify your eligibility for, and to provide you with, products and services;
  * To contact you regarding any problems with your merchandise order or sign-in account;
  * To help us serve you better, enhance and personalize your shopping experience, and to provide you with information about other products and services which we believe may be of interest to you;
  * To manage and develop our business and operations;
  * To generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use;
  * To meet legal and regulatory requirements;
  * To detect and troubleshoot problems and resolve disputes; and
  * To fulfill any other purpose consistent with this Privacy Policy.



**Do you share my personal information?**  
dressbarn does not share your PII with others except as outlined below.

We may share your information with carefully selected third-party service providers who may assist us in responding to your inquiries or requests or otherwise serve you, or for the purpose(s) authorized when it was submitted. For example, we may retain an outside company to create and distribute a direct mail or email offering. Other examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, text messages, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. In those situations, the outside company is performing work for dressbarn, and dressbarn takes appropriate steps designed to ensure your privacy and that your PII is used only to provide the services requested by us, and not for other purposes. These third parties are required to treat this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

dressbarn may also disclose said PII to third-parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information, or under limited circumstances specifically described to you when we collect the information, as in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.

dressbarn does not sell or rent your PII to third-parties for their marketing purposes.

We reserve the right to release account and other PII about you when we believe release is appropriate to ensure compliance with the law and the safety and security of our Sites, including in response to legal process and law enforcement requests; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, safety or other interests of dressbarn, our parent company, affiliates and shareholders, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Any PII shared via a dressbarn mobile application or on another website (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) may become public information. We cannot control the use of information disclosed in public forums, such as forums, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, and networking functions of mobile applications. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in these public areas, especially your Location-Data, and be careful how you disclose your PII. Content posted in public areas of any dressbarn social networking or mobile applications, including advice and opinions, represents the views and is the responsibility of those who post the content. dressbarn does not necessarily endorse, support, verify, or agree with the content posted. If you have any questions or comments about any content on the dressbarn mobile or social networking applications please contact our Customer Service Center.

**Will dressbarn send me unsolicited electronic or postal mail or text messages?**  
Unless you sign up to receive emails, text messages, and/or promotional information through the mail, or through our Sites, you will only receive emails, direct mail, or texts from us when you have submitted a specific question or comment to dressbarn, or to notify you of the progress of any orders you may have placed with us.

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of PII, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the confidentiality and integrity of the PII we collect. These safeguards are designed to protect against, but are not a guarantee against, the loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction of PII. Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. dressbarn uses the industry standard encryption protocol known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to encrypt your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than dressbarn We will retain PII only as long as necessary to fulfill a legitimate business need or as required by law. All destruction or removal of PII from our records is done securely with due regard to the sensitivity of the information concerned.

We cannot, therefore, warrant or ensure the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us through the Internet, and you do so at your own risk.

**How are children's privacy protected?**

When you enter a promotion hosted or sponsored by dressbarn and/or its partners (the "Sponsor(s)"), you may be asked to provide registration information such as your name, address, email address and other information, some of which may be optional, in order to participate. If you voluntarily submit PII to enter a sweepstakes on the website, the information that you submit may be used for sweepstakes administration and prize fulfillment purposes, and it may also be used for future marketing by the Sponsor(s), such as to notify you of a product or promotion that Sponsor(s) think/s may be of interest.

Third parties that host promotions alone or in conjunction with dressbarn may collect and use your information. Some third parties may use cookies in order to track your progress or number of entries in a promotion.

However, if you navigate away from the dressbarn Sites to a third party site, the privacy policy applicable to that site will apply.
