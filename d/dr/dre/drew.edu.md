## Overview

Drew University is posting this statement in order to emphasize its commitment to user privacy and to clearly spell out the information gathering and information disseminating practices for the web site [www.drew.edu](http://www.drew.edu/)

Visitors to the Drew web site will encounter online surveys and forms that they may choose to fill out. Completing these forms or surveys is entirely voluntary. These forms and surveys collect information for a number of different purposes: from sending out brochures to prospective students; to updating a data base for university alumni.

Completing a form or survey may require visitors to provide contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age or income level). Drew uses contact information to send users information about Drew, or, occasionally, to contact visitors, but does not share this information with others.

Unique identifiers (such as social security numbers) are sometimes collected to verify a visitor's identity and to serve as account numbers in Drew's data system. Profile information is also collected so that Drew might enhance a visitor's experience at the Drew web site; for example, showing them content that they might find interesting or informative. Providing this information is voluntary. Moreover, visitors may elect not to receive mailings and should see the "Choice/Opt Out" section that follows for an explanation of how to cancel further electronic communications. Drew does not share this information with others.

Visitors should understand that their Internet Protocol (IP) address may be used to help diagnose problems with the Drew server, and to administer the Drew web site. The IP address also is used to gather very general demographic information. An IP address only reveals the location of a computer (e.g. Drew University), not the identity of the user. In addition, the Drew web site contains links to other sites, both personal web sites at Drew as well as web sites off campus. Drew is not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites.

## Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information that is received from third parties.

## Choice/Opt Out

The Drew site provides users with an opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from the university at the point where they are asked to provide personal information. Each form will provide visitors with the following options of removing themselves from a mailing list or data base once they have joined it:

  * An email address
  * A postal address to mail changes
  * A phone number to call



## Correct/Update

In order to keep information about visitors as accurate as possible, each Drew form provides a way for visitors to correct or update information they've already submitted. Each form provides the following options for updating information:

  * An email address
  * A postal address to mail changes
  * A phone number to call
