Cookies

Our Site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. We also use cookies to save your user ID, password,
name, and email address so you don't have to re-enter them each time you visit our site.   These are also used
on the horse ads as a way to make it easier for you to send inquiries to the horse owners.

<h4>
Registration Forms
</h4>
<p>
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information like their name, email, and postal address.
We display the horse owner's contact name, contact email, contact phone, contact fax, city, state and postal code with the horse ad.
We do not display an owner's street address.  The only required field is contact email.
</p>

<p>
Contact information (email address) from the registration forms is used to get in touch with the customer when necessary such as informing the
customer that their horse or tack ad is expiring.
Contact information may also be shared with any law enforcement agency
  investigating any fraudulent or improper activity on Dream Horse Classifieds or TackTrader.com.</p>

<p>Dream Horse does not and will never sell or give your email address to any SPAMMERS or JUNK MAILERS.
  We hate spam and will do everything possible to protect your information.
  We have recently begun hiding your email address completely so that we can track and screen any and all responses to your ads
  by forcing responses through our owner contact form.
