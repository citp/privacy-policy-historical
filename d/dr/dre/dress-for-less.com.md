### IV. Cookies and pixel tags

#### 1\. What are cookies and pixel tags?

We use cookies on our website. These are small files which are automatically created by your browser and which are stored on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone or the like) when you visit our website. Cookies do not damage your computer and do not contain viruses, Trojans or any other malware.

Information is stored in the cookie relating to the specific device used. This does not mean, though, that we can immediately establish your identity.

We use pixel tags (also called tracking pixels) in our online offering. Pixels are small graphics which are integrated using the HTML code of our webpage. The pixel tag does not store or change any information on your device, pixels also do not damage your device and do not contain viruses, Trojans or any other malware.

Pixels can send personal data such as your IP address, the referrer URL of the website visited, the time the pixel was viewed, the browser used and previously placed cookie information to a web server. As a result reach measurements and other statistical analyses which serve to optimise our offering can also be conducted.

The use of cookies makes it easier for you to use our website. We use for example so-called session cookies in order to recognise that you have already visited individual pages of our website, to recognise that you have already logged into your user account or to display the shopping basket. These are deleted automatically after you leave our site.

We also use temporary, so-called comfort cookies to optimise the user-friendliness of the website, which are stored on your device for a specific period of time. If you visit our website again in order to use our services, it automatically identifies that you have already visited us and what entries and settings you have made so that you do not have to input these again. These are usually deleted after a maximum of 30 days. Only those comfort cookies with language settings store these for 365 days.

We also use cookies and pixel tags in third-party tools in order to statistically record the use of our website and to analyse the use of our website for the purpose of optimising our offering for you (see under V). These analysis, tracking and targeting cookies allow us to automatically recognise that you have already visited us when you visit our website again. These cookies are deleted automatically after a defined period of time.

#### 2\. On which legal basis is the processing with the use of cookies and pixel tags based?

The data processed with the use of cookies and pixel tags is necessary for the aforementioned purposes to protect our legitimate interests in the analysis, optimisation and efficient operation of our website as well as the legitimate interests of third parties pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 Clause 1 Letter f GDPR.

#### 3\. What opt-out do you have?

Most browsers accept cookies and pixels automatically. However, you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or a notice always appears before a new cookie is created.

The complete deactivation of cookies may result, though, in you not being able to use all of the functions of our website. Instructions on how to turn off cookies in your browser can be found in the Help function of your browser or under the following links:

### V. Tracking und targeting

The tracking and targeting measures listed below are used by us on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 Clause 1 Letter f GDPR: With the use of these tracking measures, we want to ensure that our website is tailored to the needs of users and its continuous optimisation. We also use the tracking measures to statistically record the use of our website. By using these targeting measures, we want to ensure that you are only shown advertising tailored to your actual or presumed interests on your devices.

The respective data processing purposes and data categories can be found in the description of the tracking tools.

#### 1\. adrox

This website deploys the tool adrox of adrox GmbH, Niederstr. 1, 47829 Krefeld. A cookie is stored on your terminal device, which transfers pseudonymised information about purchased items. However, adrox does not receive any information with which users can be identified personally. The information gathered serves to create conversion statistics and thus create interest-oriented advertising on the websites of the contractual partners of adrox.

If you would like to opt-out of the deployment of the tool with effect for the future, you can also refuse the placement of the cookie required to do this through the setting in your browser which deactivates the automatic placement of cookies generally. We would point out, however, that in this instance not all functions of our website will be available in full.

#### 2\. Bing Conversion Tracking

We use Conversion Tracking from Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA. This allows us to track the activities of users on our website if they arrive at our website via Bing Ads advertisements.

If you arrive at our website via a Bing Ads advertisement, a cookie is placed on your computer. Here data on the use of the website is stored by Microsoft. This includes among other things the dwell time on the website, what areas of the website were accessed and via which advertisement you arrived at the website and, in the case of an order based on this, the order value and the time of the order. Information relating to your identity is not collected.

This information is sent to Microsoft servers in the USA, where it is stored for a maximum of 180 days. Microsoft complies with the data protection regulations of the US Privacy Shield and is registered with the US Privacy Shield programme of the US Department of Commerce. We have also concluded a contract data processing agreement with Microsoft for the use of Bing Ads. With this agreement Microsoft assures that it processes the data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and protects the rights of the data subject.

If you do not want to participate in the tracking process, you can also refuse to accept the placement of a cookie required for this purpose, for example by a browser setting which generally deactivates the automatic placement of cookies. Further information on data protection and the cookies used by Microsoft Bing can be found on [Microsoft's website](https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement).

#### 3\. Criteo

On this website data is collected and stored for marketing and optimisation purposes with technologies of Criteo SA (32 Rue Blanche, 75009 Paris, France).

These technologies of Criteo allow the evaluation of our advertising campaigns and advertising content. This data can be used to create user profiles under a pseudonym. For this purpose cookies are used. The data collected using the Criteo technologies will not be used without separate consent being given by the data subject to identify personally the visitor to this website and not be combined with personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym. Criteo analyses the surfing behaviour using an algorithm and can then display targeted product recommendations as personalised advertising banners on other websites (so-called publishers). There is no other use of your data or disclosure to third parties. Further information on the technologies of Criteo can be found in [Criteo's privacy policy](https://www.criteo.com/de/privacy/).

Please note that if you deactivate the display of personalised advertisements from Criteo and other advertising partners, you will continue to receive advertisements, but these will be less tailored to your interests/surfing behaviour.

#### 4\. Econda Web Analytics

To optimise the website and the databases in the background, we use the web analysis solutions of econda GmbH, Eisenlohrstr. 43, 76135 Karlsruhe.

#### 7\. Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics on our website, a web analysis service of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (hereafter: "Google").

The information is used to analyse the use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to perform other services related to the use of the website and the internet for market research purposes and to ensure that these websites are tailored to the needs of users.

This information is also forwarded to third parties insofar as this is allowed by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google. Under no circumstances will your IP address be linked to other Google data. The IP addresses are anonymised, as a result they cannot be assigned to users (IP masking).

As an alternative to the [browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de), in particular with browsers on mobile devices, you can also prevent the collection of data by Google Analytics by clicking on this link.

#### 8\. Google Adwords Conversion Tracking

We use Google Conversion Tracking on our website, a web analysis service of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (hereafter: "Google") in order to statistically record the use of our website and for the purpose of optimising our offering for you. A cookie is placed by Google Adwords on your computer if you arrive at our website via a Google advertisement.

These cookies expire after 180 days. If the user visits certain pages of the website of the AdWords customer and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can tell that the user has clicked on the advertisement and been redirected to this page.

The information produced by the cookie on your use of this website is sent to a Google server in the USA, where it is stored. Google complies with the data protection regulations of the US Privacy Shield and is registered with the US Privacy Shield programme of the US Department of Commerce. We have also concluded a contract data processing agreement for the use of Google AdWords. With this agreement Google assures that it processes the data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and protects the rights of the data subject.

Every AdWords customer receives another cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained with the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for Conversion Tracking. We learn the total number of users who have clicked on their advertisement and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not obtain any information with which users can be personally identified.

If you do not want to participate in the tracking process, you can also refuse to accept the placement of a cookie required for this purpose, for example by a browser setting which generally deactivates the automatic placement of cookies. You can also deactivate cookies for conversion tracking by adjusting the settings in your browser so that cookies from the domain "www.googleadservices.com" are blocked.
