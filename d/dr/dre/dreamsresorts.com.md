### LEGAL STATEMENT

Policy and guidelines for use of marks in advertising, promotion and display   
AMRESORTS and its affiliates have the exclusive rights to use the AMRESORTS service mark and other AMRESORTS marks and logos. Under the trademark laws, the AMRESORTS companies must prevent the use of their names and marks in ways that could give customers and potential customers the mistaken impression that an AMRESORTS company owns or is affiliated with an agency using its marks. AMRESORTS (and trademark law) allow the "fair use" of AMRESORTS marks and logos by agencies, in a truthful, informational way in accordance with the rules provided here. Please adhere to the following specific rules when using AMRESORTS names and marks in promotions on Internet web sites and in print advertisements.

### General Rules 

All uses of the AMRESORTS name or any AMRESORTS mark must relate solely to AMRESORTS travel packages and not to the agencies selling them. Agencies that sell AMRESORTS packages may not refer to themselves in any context as "AMRESORTS travel agents" or to their businesses as "official AMRESORTS travel agencies."

Travel agencies may only use signage, window displays, or point of purchase items employing the AMRESORTS name or any AMRESORTS mark (a) as provided by AMRESORTS, or (b) as approved in writing by AMRESORTS.

No one may copy any content appearing in any AMRESORTS website, brochure, or advertising without express written permission from AMRESORTS.

AMRESORTS marks should be used with the ® symbol, and the use should be accompanied by a legend appearing at the bottom of the page where used that the mark is registered; for example, AMRESORTS is a registered trademark.

### Internet Web Sites 

No one may use the name AMRESORTS or any AMRESORTS mark (or anything confusingly similar) as part of an Internet domain name.  
No agency may display the AMRESORTS mark by itself on a web site without prior written approval.

Travel agencies may use an AMRESORTS mark in a website in the following ways: a. An AMRESORTS mark may be used as part of a statement such as "We sell AMRESORTS travel packages," so long as all of the words in the sentence are of a similar size. b. An AMRESORTS mark may be used in conjunction with links, schedules, product descriptions, or order forms, expressly referring to the sale of AMRESORTS travel products by the agency. c. In any case where the AMRESORTS name or mark is used, the name of the travel agency must appear on the same screen, above the AMRESORTS name or mark, and in a size at least 125% of the size of the AMRESORTS name or mark used.

### Print Advertising 

No AMRESORTS marks may appear in Yellow Pages advertising.  
As discussed above, truthful, informational statements are permitted in promotional materials and advertisements, such as, "We sell AMRESORTS travel packages." In any case where the AMRESORTS name or mark is used, the name of the travel agency must appear in close proximity, above the AMRESORTS name or mark, and in a size at least 125% of the size of the AMRESORTS name or mark used.

Marks must not be used as an agency identifier; i.e., an AMRESORTS mark may not appear by itself or at the top of a page in an advertisement.
