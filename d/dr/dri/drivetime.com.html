        At DriveTime, we believe that the confidentiality and protection of your personal
        information is one of our fundamental responsibilities. We want you to know that
        you can count on us to protect the privacy and security of your customer information
        and to provide you with the responsive, professional service you deserve.
    </p>
    <p>
        While you can visit and browse through the DriveTime.com website without disclosing
        who you are or providing any other personal information about yourself, some key
        features of the site require us to collect information from our users. By using
        this site, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Information Collection and Use
    </h4>
    <p>
        We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers or former
        customers to anyone, except as permitted by law. Nonpublic, personal information
        includes any information about you that you or someone else has provided to us and
        that is not publicly available as well as information about your transactions with
        us. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information we receive from a consumer-reporting agency.</li>
        <li>Your payment history if you have previously purchased a vehicle from us.</li>
        <li>Information we collect from you via the credit application page located at <a href="/GetApproved">http://www.drivetime.com/getapproved/</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We may, however, disclose certain information to government agencies, consumer-reporting
        agencies, and other outside parties as permitted or required by the Federal Privacy
        Act and other applicable laws. These disclosures are typically made for specific,
        limited purposes, such as verifying individuals’ identities, reducing fraud and
        identity theft, verifying information or credit approvals, and reporting transactions
        to credit reporting agencies.
    </p>
    <p>
        DriveTime is also committed to preventing others from gaining unauthorized access
        to your customer information, and we enforce our privacy policies through the use
        of processes, procedures, and technology specifically designed to ensure the confidentiality
        of your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, we restrict access to your information by our employees and agents
        to that of business purposes only. Agents may include third parties who help service
        your account or help provide our products and services to you. We may also enter
        into joint marketing arrangements with other parties to make you aware of products
        or services we think you might be interested in. We require any party who has access
        to your information to maintain the confidentiality of the information and not use
        it for their own purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you specifically request us to provide nonpublic personal information to anyone,
        such as mortgage companies or other lenders, we will provide the information only
        upon your written or verified email authorization.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Encrypted Data Transmission
    </h4>
    <p>
        This Web site secures your private information using a VeriSign SSL Certificate.
        Information exchanged with any address beginning with “https” is encrypted using
        SSL before it is transmitted.
    </p>
    <h4>
        About Cookies
    </h4>
    <p>
        A cookie is a small text file containing information that a Web site stores on your
        computer's hard disk so the site can remember something about you at a later time.
        Cookies can make a Web site more useful by allowing the site to personalize information
        for visitors and by storing information about user preferences on a particular site
        so that the user does not have to re-enter information, etc., each time he or she
        returns to the site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major
        Web sites such as DriveTime.com use them to provide useful features for their customers.
        The cookie information does not include personal data such as name, age, phone number,
        e-mail address or mailing address.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most browsers are automatically set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you
        can set your browser to reject cookies. However, you might not be able to use certain
        features on the site.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Log Files
    </h4>
    <p>
        DriveTime uses Google Analytics to analyze traffic to this Web site in order to
        help us understand our customers’ and visitors' needs and to continually improve
        our site for them. The data they collect on our behalf may include search engine
        referral, affiliate referrals, traffic driven by banner ads or other online promotions,
        how visitors navigate around the site, and the most popular pages. We also collect
        certain technical information, such as the browser version and operating system.
        Google Analytics collects only anonymous, aggregate statistics. For example, we
        do not tie a specific visit to a specific IP address and we do not correlate this
        tracking with personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Assistance to Victim of Identity Theft
    </h4>
    <p>
        If you suspect that someone has had unauthorized access to your account with us
        or access to your personally identifiable information, you should report this crime
        to your local law enforcement agency and to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
        To speak with a trained FTC telephone counselor, call toll-free 1-877-IDTheft (1-877-438-4338).
        Or, to enter information about your complaint into a secure FTC online database,
        visit <a href="http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft" target="_blank">www.consumer.gov/idtheft</a>. The
        site also provides links to consumer education materials.

    <h4>
        Ways to Limit Direct Marketing You May Receive from Outside Sources
    </h4>
    <p>
        There are outside agencies and companies that compile mailing lists for purchase
        by marketers. You may wish to have your name removed from many of these lists by
        following the procedures outlined below:
    </p>
    <div class="privacy-subsection">
        <h4>
            Direct Marketing Association and Member Companies</h4>
        <p>
            To remove your name and direct mail or telemarketing lists of members of the Direct
            Marketing Association, send a written request with your name, address, and Social
            Security Number (if it was included in the mailing you received) to the Direct Marketing
            Association. The Direct Marketing Association is responsible for notifying its members
            (i.e., the agencies and companies that compile mailing lists) that you want your
            name removed from the lists they sell. Your name and address remains in their consumer
            exclusion files for five years.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must register yourself; they cannot process any request from us. You may visit
            their Web site at <a href="http://www.dmachoice.org" target="_blank">www.dmachoice.org</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Credit Reporting Agencies (Credit Bureaus)
        </h4>
        <p>
            National consumer credit reporting agencies may also sell or share your name and
            certain other information to various outside companies for marketing purposes. You
            may direct these agencies not to do so by calling their toll-free telephone number
            at 1-888-567-8688 (1-888-OPTOUT)
        </p>
        <h4>
            Federal “Do Not Call” Registry
        </h4>
        <p>
            The FTC has implemented a Do Not Call Registry, effective October 1, 2003. To register
            for the Telemarketing Do Not Call list, visit the FTC’s Web site at <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov" target="_blank">
                www.donotcall.gov</a>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4>
        Notification of Changes
    </h4>
    <p>
        These practices and policies are subject to change, but we will communicate any
        material changes to you. The practices and policies in this disclosure replace all
        previous privacy notices or statements of DriveTime.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Receiving E-mail from DriveTime
    </h4>
    <p>
        DriveTime does not send unsolicited e-mail. When you provide your e-mail address
        to us, it is under the explicit understanding that you want to receive information
        from DriveTime. Every time you submit a request for information, DriveTime will
        send you an automatic response confirming your submission. In addition, we may contact
        you from time to time (or have our partners or vendors contact you in our behalf)
        for the purpose of informing you about DriveTime products, services and programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each e-mail sent by DriveTime contains a link that provides access to a simple automated
        facility to opt out of future e-mails from us. If you wish to opt out of additional
        e-mail communications, and no longer have the e-mail with the link, you can opt
