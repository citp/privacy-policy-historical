### 4\. How our systems combine information and how we store, transfer,  
retain, and protect your information

  * **Our Systems –** All PII is recorded in our ecommerce system  
and all NPII is stored in a separate tracking system. A user’s PII and  
NPII are linked by way of the fact that their information in both  
systems is categorized under the same unique identification number  
(UID). Due to the shared UID number in these systems, all information  
collected and stored in both systems is treated by 383 Media as PII.  
However, neither system is able to use nor automatically access the  
information stored in the other. Where the NPII collected is  
disassociated from the UID, the information collected is treated as  
NPII. Where such Mix Panel is a third party application utilized by  
383 Media for the purpose of securely hosting Customer Relations  
Management (CRM). 383 Media analyzes data collected on an aggregate  
basis to optimize ecommerce flow and marketing campaigns.
  * **Storage of Your Information –** Information that we collect  
may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country  
in which we, our subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors,  
representatives, agents, or resellers maintain such information. PII  
on our servers is only accessible from our physical premises, premises  
of our subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, representatives, agents  
and authenticated networks and personnel. Access is limited to  
authorized personnel only, and company networks are password protected  
and subject to additional policies and procedures for security. By  
your use of our product you consent to any such transfer of  
information outside of your country.
  * **Data Transfer –** Information may be transferred to the 383  
Media group in the United States or other countries that may have less  
protective data protection laws than the region in which you are  
situated and be accessible by 383 Media employees or contractors  
exclusively to be used in accordance with the purposes outlined in  
this policy. For the same purposes the information may be shared with  
partners and vendors that process information on behalf of 383 Media,  
including, for instance, banking and credit card partners to process  
payments made by you on our site. 383 Media has taken steps so that  
the collected information, if transferred, receives an adequate level  
of protection.
  * **Data Retention –** In general, 383 Media will retain your PII  
for as long as you are a user of our products and thereafter for  
internal reporting and reconciliation purposes as necessitated by  
legal requirements and to provide you with any feedback or information  
you might request or require. After this time period we may delete or  
de-identify the information from our systems. Please note that if we  
remove your PII from our systems as described above, because we keep  
track of past transactions, we cannot delete information associated  
with those transactions. Additionally, it may be impossible to  
completely delete your information because of our data backup  
processes

safeguards to protect the information we maintain and ensure it is  
used in accordance to the terms of this policy. Our security controls  
are designed to restrict access to the information to authorized
