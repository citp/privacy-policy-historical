In addition, Drillinginfo, third parties working on our behalf, and our partners may collect other information about your use of our apps and website and other websites.

**_How do we collect it?_**

Drillinginfo collects information you provide when you express an interest in obtaining additional information about Drillinginfo services, registering for an event or webinar, or downloading any Drillinginfo content.

On our website and apps, Drillinginfo, third parties working on our behalf, and our partners, including social networking sites, may also place, view, and/or use “cookies,” web server logs, web beacons, and other electronic tools to collect information about your use of the Drillinginfo and other websites.

We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our apps and other products. This can include information in or about the content you provide (like metadata), such as the date a file was created. We also collect information about how you use our apps and other products, such as the features you use and the actions you take.

We also use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, and some similar services to better understand your use of our website and apps. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the website, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to visiting. Google uses the data to track and examine the use of the website, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the website to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&gl=us). Google offers an opt-out mechanism for the web available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

In some of our apps, we create a video recording of some sessions. In parallel with that, a log of app activity is created and uploaded to the server, along with the user id used during the session. Each session is also provided with a rough location (country/district) at the time of use.

**_Can you disable cookies?_**

You can delete and disable cookies. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to disable cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. You must do this for each browser you use and on each device.

The Drillinginfo website and all Drillinginfo apps and products are designed to be used only by those over 16. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the service at any time or in any manner.

If we learn that personal information has been collected by us from persons under 13 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

**_We sometimes use customer testimonials in our materials and on our web site – do these require permission?_**

Yes.

### Data Security

**_How do we protect your data?_**

Drillinginfo takes data security very seriously and we use industry-standard physical, technical, and administrative procedures. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.

Our services use industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. All supplied sensitive and credit card information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway provider’s database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential.

It’s important to stress, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about our security protocols, please email us at [support@drillinginfo.com](mailto:support@drillinginfo.com).

**_How can you improve your data security from side?_**

When logging into the Drillinginfo website and apps, you should take every precaution to protect your own personal information, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters, numbers and symbols, and make sure you use a secure browser.

### Sharing Data with Third Parties

**_Do we share your information with third parties?_**

We may share certain information, including your personal information, with third parties for the following reasons:

  * To help service providers assist in operating our business.
  * To comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process.
  * To produce relevant documents or information in connection with litigation, arbitration, mediation, adjudication, government or internal investigations, or other legal or administrative proceedings.
  * To protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of Drillinginfo or others.
  * To enforce any terms of service or other legal disclosures on or related to this website or apps.
  * In connection with a sale or other transfer of all or some of the assets of Drillinginfo and/or in connection with a sale or merger of Drillinginfo or any division of Drillinginfo.
  * To provide you with the services or products requested by you, and to perform other activities for business and marketing purposes related to such services and products.
  * We may disclose information about our users on an anonymized and aggregated basis to third parties, without restriction. Efforts will be made to assure that individual companies will not be recognizable in these aggregate statistics. We also reserve the right to use data where companies have given explicit permission.



**_What protections are provided by third parties with whom we share data information?_**

Generally, we limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information.

We cannot offer guarantees, however, as the collection, use, and disclosure of information by these third parties is governed by their own privacy policies, not this privacy policy, and is not the responsibility of Drillinginfo.

**_Do we source data from third parties?_**

Drillinginfo obtains business contact and company information and other data from third party sources, such as business intelligence providers. The information obtained from these third parties is used to support Drillinginfo’s marketing, sales, and business efforts.

Our website and apps include social media links, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn buttons. Please be aware that Drillinginfo is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal information.

You should be aware that any information or comments you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blogs, contact us at [support@drillinginfo.com](mailto:support@drillinginfo.com).

### Information Across Borders

**_Where is Drillinginfo’s service hosted?_**

Drillinginfo’s service is hosted in the United States and the United Kingdom. If you choose to use the service from Canada, the European Union, or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are likely transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing.

**_What if my personal information is transferred to other countries? Do they have their own privacy policies and regulations?_**

Some of the uses and disclosures mentioned in this privacy policy may involve the transfer of your personal information to various countries around the world that may have different levels of privacy protection than the United States. By submitting your personal information through the Drillinginfo website or apps, you consent to such transfers and to the processing of your personal information in such countries for the purposes described in this privacy policy.

**_ _** ** _Are there international mechanisms?_**

Yes. We comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the European Commission and Swiss Administration, to provide companies with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States in support of transatlantic commerce. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at [support@drillinginfo.com](mailto:support@drillinginfo.com). We commit to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources and non-human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Shield Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles.
