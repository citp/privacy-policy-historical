**Information Collection**

|  |   
---|---|---  
  
WebTrafficSchool.com is the sole owner of the information collected on www.WebTrafficSchool.com. WebTrafficSchool collects information from our users during enrollment. Confidential information about you will not be provided to anyone other than yourself or the court that you have selected as responsible for your citation. Under no circumstances will we provide any details about you to junk emailers or other direct marketers. We only share your personally identifiable information with third parties only as outlined within this privacy policy or if required by law to do so. 

Interactive Solutions, Inc. and The Learning Annex have entered into a trademark agreement exclusively and this is agreement is not to be construed as a partnership or joint venture, of any kind. No information, electronic or otherwise, is exchanged between Interactive Solutions, Inc. and The Learning Annex.   
  
| **Registration** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
In order to use WebTrafficSchool.com's web site, you must first enroll in our course. During enrollment you are required to give us your contact information (such as name, address and email address). We require your Drivers License number, which is a unique identifier that will enable you to log into our course after the initial enrollment process. We also require some personal information like last four digits of your social security number, (your social security number if you are taking the Florida course) date of birth, height, weight, and eye color.  
  
| **Information Use** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
The information we collect is used to help us access your record in case you are experiencing technical difficulties while taking the course. It also helps in clarifying your information such as County and State, in order to process your certificate of completion accurately. Unique identifiers such as driver's license number and citation number are used to identify you as the user and to help in accurate certificate processing for your court or insurance company. The demographic information is for our statistical purposes only.

The personally identifiable information we collect online is used for verification of your identity while taking our online course. We only share your personally identifiable information with third parties only as outlined within this privacy policy. While taking our course online, security questions will appear on the screen asking you to identify yourself. The correct answers to the questions are based on the information you provided us with during enrollment. Each course has a different security measure depending on the State in which the citation was issued. 

We use your email address to send you important notifications and to make sure you complete the course quickly and efficiently. For example, sending a reminder if your court expiration date is near, if your tuition payment has not been received, if the system cannot recognize the court that issued your citation, test scores, payment receipts, Fed Ex tracking numbers, our quarterly newsletter with discount offers and tips on safe driving. If you choose not to receive any communications from us via email, you may send us an email with the word "Unsubscribe" in the subject field, or call our toll free number to have a customer support representative block your email address from receiving communications from us and our web site. This will opt you out of any email communications from us. 

The physical address is used to mail a copy of your completion certificate to you for your records. We use the phone number to contact you only when it's absolutely necessary to do so. All other information like your driver's license and citation number is collected in accordance to the court issuing your ticket.   
  
  
| Cookies |  |   
---|---|---  
  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user in our servers. Cookies are linked to personally identifiable information while on our site. We use session ID cookies only. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. The cookies help to keep track of the user's progress while on our site. They keep a record of the times and dates you log in and out of each section of the course. They also help the web site to remember where users log off on their individual courses. It is necessary for the users to enable cookies, as some certain features will not work without them

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather brad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service (for details see below).

We store information that we collect through cookies to create user profiles. A profile is stored information that we keep on you that details what section of the course you are in. Collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to help in keeping track of their progress. This profile is used to update the user's final certificate of completion for the course. 

We also use third party tracking service (Human Click - interactive user support chat) who sets cookies on our set track internal progress of the application. The Human Click tracking service reports this data to use in aggregate so we can better understand our users and to improve our site. This information is not tied to any individual user.

Special Offers and Updates** |  |

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify successful enrollment. We also send an email when user's due date is near and after they graduate successfully. Upon graduating the course, we send associate email to users to refer other people to our course, and in return they would receive a referral fee. We provide a way to opt-out of the associate emails. Users can click on the "Unsubscribe" link or call our toll free number to have their emails blocked. We then remove the users email from our mailing list  
  
**Newsletter** |  |

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Unsubscribe section.  
  
**Service Announcements** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
Sometimes it might be necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For example if we are experiencing technical difficulties or if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. Those who have un subscribed from receiving emails will not receive these emails.  
  
**Customer Service** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email, online live support, or phone, in accordance with the users wishes  
  
**Sharing Legal Disclaimer** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.  
  
**Aggregate Information** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
We do not share aggregated demographic information with anyone. We solely use this information for statistical purposes.  
  
**Third Party Advertisers** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
We do not share web site usage information about users with any third party companies except for occasional Google Site Stats ads delivered by Google. These are used by WebTrafficSchool.com and Google to measure the performance of the advertising Google delivers to WebTrafficSchool.com through the use of cookies, small strings of text that are placed on your computer when you click on ads. These cookies typically remain active on your computer for about 30 days. If you visit certain pages on WebTrafficSchool.com, Google and WebTrafficSchool.com will be able to tell that you saw the ad delivered by Google.

**Business Transitions ** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
In the event WebTrafficSchool.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email and a prominent notice will be placed on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, they will be given choice consistent with our notification changes.   
  
**Third Party Intermediaries** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. We use a court assigned agent, Coordinated Court Services (CCS), to print certificates of completion for certain counties in California. Our system only sends information that is required by the court to CCS to enable them print certificates of completion. For the States of Virginia and Florida, we have contracted with outside agents in each state to offer customer support and to print traffic school certificates of completion. These agents do not collect any personally identifiable information. They merely access our database to offer customer support to students in the respective states, and to print certificates of completion. They do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.  
  
**Third Party Service Providers** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
We partner with [www.idrivesafely.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20050404070918id_/http%3A//driversed.com/faq/www.idrivesafely.com) to provide online traffic school in the States of Colorado, New Mexico, and Missouri. When you sign up for traffic school in these three states through our website, we keep a record of your driver's license, email, name and contact information. We only use this information to keep track of the referrals through our website. [www.idrivesafely.com](http://www.idrivesafely.com/) collects all other personally identifiable information and they are the sole owners of the information they collect.

**Surveys** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
After the course completion, our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes reason for choosing our site, how you heard about our site, how many times you have attended traffic school, level of computer expertise, and means of connecting to the internet. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site and for statistical purposes.  
  
**Tell-A-Friend** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them to give their own email address or driver license number as a discount code. WebTrafficSchool.com will automatically give a discount to each one of them, as long as the referred friend uses the discount code while enrolling and successfully completes the course. Webtrafficschool.com stores this information for the sole purpose of tracking the success of our referral program.   
  
**Security** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. Sensitive information submitted through our enrollment form is protected using SSL encryption. Our enrollment form displays the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer indicating a secure page.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Employees have their own user name and password to access student's information in the database. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every year as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to 

[info@webtrafficschool.com](mailto:info@webtrafficschool.com). 

Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Personal Information  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), we provide a way to correct, update or delete users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the course "Summary" section or by emailing our Customer Support at [info@webtrafficschool.com](mailto:info@webtrafficschool.com). [Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below].  
  
**Notification of Changes** |  |   
---|---|---  
  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. 

In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web Site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
