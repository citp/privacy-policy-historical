**3\. Sharing Personal Information with Third Parties**  
Other than as expressly described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personal Information with any third-party, except in the following cases (and then, only to extent reasonably necessary under the circumstances): (a) to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, subpoena or governmental request; (b) to enforce this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations of it; (c) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (d) to respond to your support requests; (e) to respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties; (f) to respond to claims that contact information (e.g. phone number, name, etc.) of a third-party has been posted or transmitted without their consent or as a form of harassment; (g) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the Company, its Users and the general public; (h) when the Company is undergoing any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (i) pursuant to your explicit approval, in order to supply certain services you have requested from Company.

This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of any External Network or any other third-party.

**4\. Cookies and Local Storage**  
When you visit our Website or use the App, we may use industry-wide technologies such as "cookies" (or similar technologies) ( **"Cookies"** ), which store certain information on your device ( **“Local Storage”** ) and which will allow us to enable automatic sign-in to the Services and make your use of the Services more convenience and effortless.

**5\. Advertising**  
From time to time, we may allow third-parties advertisers ( **“Advertisers”** ) to sponsor advertising content or links ( **“Ads”** ) that can be directly accessed from within the Services.

However, before such Information is shared with the Advertisers, all Personal Information involved will be aggregated into anonymous statistics. For example, we might provide an analysis of data that says “1000 Users in California who accessed the App in the month of June using a Samsung Galaxy S4 shared a Drip on Facebook about free off-line map applications for Android.” That said, keep in mind that if you click through links to leave the Website or the App and go to the Advertisers’ sites, those sites may gather information about you.
