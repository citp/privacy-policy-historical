**Information we collect when you visit our websites**

Drippler and its partners use cookies or similar technologies on our websites to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

Drippler also gathers certain information about the use of Drippler’s services, including the number of unique visitors, the frequency of visits, how users interact with the sites, user experience preferences, IP address, and other information that may help Drippler improve the user experience, mitigate fraudulent activity, and comply with legal requirements. Such information may include, but is not limited to the following:

Log information

When you visit Drippler’s sites we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs. This type of information includes details of how you interacted with our services. It may include personal information such as: IP address, Unique Device Identifier, the content of web pages, transactions with APIs (Application Program Interface), activity and content of visitor interaction with call center representatives; application usage activity, hardware information, hardware and system settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, referral URL, etc.

Cookies

A cookie is a small data file that is managed by your web browser or other application and stored on your local system. Drippler uses session and persistent cookies to, among other things, identify your computer during a particular interaction and analyze your behavior during a particular visit. Most web browsers provide you with the ability to accept or decline cookies, as well as to be warned each time a cookie is being sent. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully use Drippler’s services.

Pixel tags

Pixel tags, also known as web beacons, help Drippler better manage user experience and content tracking. Pixel tags are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, which provide a similar function to cookies and are used to track user interaction with content provided by Drippler or an affiliate organization. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly within content. The small size and transparency of pixel tags are not intended to deceive content recipients, but minimize distraction.

**How we use your personal information**

**Advertising**

From time to time, we may allow third-party advertisers (“ **Advertisers** ”) to sponsor advertising content or links (“ **Ads** ”) that can be directly accessed from within the Services.   In order to provide Ads that we think would be of most interest to our users, we may share certain Information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) to Advertisers. For example, we might provide an analysis of data that says “1000 users in California who accessed the application in the month of June using a Samsung Galaxy S7 shared a Drip on Facebook about free off-line map applications for Android.”  That said, keep in mind that if you click through links to leave the application and go to the Advertisers’ sites, those sites may gather information about you.  This policy does not cover the practices of any Advertiser or any other third-party.
