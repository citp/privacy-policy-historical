DriveArabia.com collects minimal inconsequential information from the users of this site. No personal information is stored on our systems.

Advertising banners and pop-up windows appearing on this web site are delivered to you by our advertising partners. These advertising companies may place or may not place a very small cookie file on your computer in the course of delivering advertisements to this site, so that you do not have to view the same advertisements numerous times. Additionally, information about your visit to this and other web sites (but not your name, address, or other personal information) is used to serve ads to you on this site and other sites about goods and services that are of interest to you. This is now the norm when dealing with any website on the internet that has any form of advertising on it.
