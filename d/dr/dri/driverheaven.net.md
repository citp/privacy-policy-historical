CONDUCT RULES  
Welcome to the DriverHeaven forum, I hope you will enjoy posting here and debating with some good friendly likeminded people, as in any community we need some sort of conduct guidance which will be enforced by our moderators/staff.

* One account per person only. if you have more than one account or know someone who has more than one -- contact me via email at [zardon@driverheaven.net](mailto:zardon@driverheaven.net) to have additional accounts removed.  
* Forum members will obey the requests and judgments of moderators, adminstrators/staff and will respond in a polite and respectful manner.  
* no cursing in the thread subject lines.  
* No racial, sexual, homophobic, or any other slur targeting a minority will be tolerated. This behavior is grounds for banning.   
* Spamming is not permitted and repeat offenses will be grounds for banning.  
* No warez and porn allowed on any level on Driverheaven forum. This also includes the posting of keys and/or activation codes for products. Posting of pictures or links/URLs, websites depicting genetilia/hard core pornography is strictly forbidden, repeat offenses are grounds for banning. No child pornography tolerated and IPs will be reported to authorities.   
* Offensive posts should be reported via the "report this post" option.  
* As this is a driver related forum, no direct copying of other peoples work/code will be allowed.  
* signatures must not exceed 10 lines or 5 lines with a 100 pixel deep image, this is to ensure the forum text is easy to read.  
* no commercial advertising in public forum thread on Driverheaven without permission from Zardon, this is against site policy.

STAFF MEMBERS AND REPORTING PROBLEMS  
DriverHeaven strives to be a friendly and safe place for everyone, and a great part of the responsibility for such rests on the shoulders of various staff members. If there is a technical issue with the forum itself, post in the feedback forum and the Administrators will see it and take care of it in there, but don't PM the Administrators unnecessarily. They are generally tied with other site and server related issues, and it is the rest of the staff's job to handle problems without unnecessarily burdening the Administrators.

If you have a problem, or see a problem, especially one involving an infraction of the rules posted in this thread you should report this by clicking the link in the lower right hand corner of every post. This will notify all of the Moderators assigned to a particular forum of the post in question. If you prefer, you can PM any of the Moderators for the forum section that the questionable post is in. If you want to see which Moderators are in what forum section, you can refer to [this page](http://www.driverheaven.net/showgroups.php?s=). Should there be no Moderators for that particular section, or if its a problem spanning multiple sections, or something else altogether, report the post anyway, and PM one of the Super Moderators, who are listed on [this page](http://www.driverheaven.net/showgroups.php?s=). Should you have a problem with the way a certain matter was handled by a Moderator or a Super Moderator, or have a complaint of any sort about any staff member, contact the Moderation Team Leader, WyretheWolf. He also handles moderation problems; so don't be surprised if he takes care of a particular issue.

Above all, please keep in mind that it’s the moderator team's job to keep Driverheaven a friendly and safe place for everyone, and we truly appreciate it when members help us through reporting problematic posts or other board members. Thank you for your cooperation.
