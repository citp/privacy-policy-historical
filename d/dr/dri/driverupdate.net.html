                    Utilities</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>" or "<strong>our</strong>") has
                developed this privacy policy to demonstrate its commitment to
                protecting your privacy. This privacy policy (the "Privacy
                Policy") is intended to describe for you, as an individual who
                is a user of the Slimware Utilities websites, mobile apps,
                social media sites, software and/or services (collectively the
                "Services"), the information we collect, how that information
                may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about
                such uses and disclosures. We seek to handle the information we
                collect in a manner that complies fully with the privacy
                requirements under all applicable United States federal and
                state privacy laws and regulations.
            </p>

            <p>
                We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. By
                using the Services, you are accepting the practices described
                in this Privacy Policy, and agreeing to the processing and
                storage of information we collect from you in the United
                States and, in connection with certain Services, the
                Philippines and other non-United States jurisdictions. If you
                do not agree with the terms and conditions set forth in this
                Privacy Policy, then please do not provide us with any
                information and do not access, browse or use the Services. If

            <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

            <p>
                The information we collect will either be 1) Personal
                Information or 2) Anonymous Information. <i><u>Personal
                        Information</u></i> means information that may directly or
                indirectly identify you, such as your name, address, email
                address, and telephone number. <i><u>Anonymous
                        Information</u></i> means information that does not directly
                or indirectly identify you, such as the number of page views,
                link clicks, and login times. We may use both Personal and
                Anonymous Information to create Aggregate
                Information. <i><u>Aggregate Information</u></i> is derived
                from the grouping of information we collect into groups and/or
                categories, which does not identify you directly or
                indirectly.
            </p>
