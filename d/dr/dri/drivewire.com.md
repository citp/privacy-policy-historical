#### What information does DriveWire collect from you?

To avail of our products and services, you need to give us two types of information: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Giving this information allows you not only access to our products and services, but also a customized shopping experience (this will be further explained in the latter part of the policy). Personally Identifiable Information allows us to know the specifics of who you are. This type of information is typically needed when you are ordering a product or service, registering for a gift list, participating in sweepstakes, filling out surveys, and sending us feedback. Specifically, this information includes your name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, credit card information, or other payment information. This information allows DriveWire to deliver personalized service. 

On the other hand, Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that is not identifiable to a specific individual. This type of information is compiled and analyzed on a personal and aggregated basis. Non-Personally Identifiable Information includes your Web browser, the next Uniform Resource Locator (URL) you go to, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. 

#### How do we collect information and what we do with it? 

Our goal is to give our shoppers a unique and customized shopping experience. To do this, we need to collect private information from our customers. We use this information to improve our service. For example, your contact information enables us to keep you updated on the status of your orders. We also use your personal information to send promotional items and to administer the site. 

Demographic data is also collected at our site through a third-party advertising server, which provides the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server. The third-party server also monitors the pages a customer viewed in our site. 

The monitoring information is analyzed in an aggregate basis. Once analyzed, this information is used to shape the site in favor of the customer's preferences. We also conduct research on our visitor's demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on the information submitted in billing forms and server log files. 

The obtained data is used to improve your shopping experience at our site. Based on your preferences, we customize our marketing and promotional efforts to give you relevant offers. 

It is also important to remember that all information provided by the third-party ad server is not personally identifiable data. 

Third-party ad servers are only one means to collect data; we also collect data from _Online Surveys, Contests and Sweepstakes,_ and _Cookies_. 

####  _Online surveys and polling_

To improve our services, we occasionally ask our customers to fill out order forms, which maybe collected by third-party affiliates. Despite being Non-Personally Identifiable Information, this information is still strictly kept private. Customers who do not wish to participate can simply decline whenever they are asked. 

####  _Contests and sweepstakes_

Whenever you participate in a contest or a promotion, DriveWire needs your contact information (e.g. name, address, and e-mail address) to administer the contests, to send you promotional e-mails, and to notify winners. The disclosure of your private information is a condition of your participation. In order to receive prizes, participants need to submit an Affidavit of Eligibility to qualify you to receive prizes according to contest rules. 

#### _Using Cookies_

This will be further discussed in the DriveWire Cookies section. 

#### _Contact information collected by third-party affiliates_

Whenever you contact our customer service representatives through telephone or e-mail, we keep a record of your correspondence or comments. If you report a problem, we collect the information and place it in a file specific to you. If you call our customer service representatives via phone, we ask for your name and e-mail address to send you a reply. 

From time to time, third-party affiliates also send us records of your correspondence and activities on the site. We also place this information in a file specific to you. 

Our third-party affiliates are vital to providing you with top class customer service. To do this, we share your private information with them. 

####  Who else gets your private information? 

For the most part, your private information is used only to: (1) process your orders; (2) keep you updated on the status of your order; (3) monitor site statistics; (4) improve site performance; and (5) notify you of our special offers and discount promos. 

To process your orders, we need to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to our third-party affiliates. For instance, we need to disclose your credit card number to the issuing bank in order to confirm your payment and process your order. 

Rest assured that we do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to non-relevant parties. On occasion, we share your Non-Personally Identifiable Information to our advertising affiliates to analyze sales, traffic patterns, and other site-related data. 

When we deem it necessary, we may release your account information to enforce our _Terms and Conditions_ to protect the rights, property, and safety of our site and our users. 

Except as otherwise stated in this policy, DriveWire does not share customers' Personally Identifiable Information to other merchants. With your permission, we may share your customer information to companies that sell products and services that may be of interest to you. This would be done for marketing purposes only and no credit card information would be given. 

When it is required for law enforcement by judicial authorities, we may provide your Personally Identifiable Information to appropriate governmental regulators. For example, we may disclose your information to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies activities that we deem to be unlawful. 

Rest assured that you will be notified if your information is disclosed whenever any third party wants to collect your information. This allows you to choose whether or not you will let us share your information to the concerned third party. 

We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website. 

#### Ownership and distribution of your information 

Once you have submitted your information, it is stored in the DriveWire database and becomes the property of DriveWire Inc. This information may be passed to our dealers and fulfillment partners when necessary. When this happens, the information is subject to the respective privacy policy of the third-party recipient. Our third-party affiliates need this information to process your order. You are free to opt out of this arrangement; however, upon choosing this option, we will be unable to fulfill your order. If you do not opt out of the arrangement upon the initial time of the order, subsequent requests to opt out of the arrangement will be addressed to the concerned third-party affiliate. 

####  Updating Personally Identifiable Information

You have unlimited access to the personal information that you provide us. You can edit it during each ordering process to update the information you have submitted. You can also change it whenever you log on to the site using your personal account. We encourage you to update your account whenever necessary. 

#### Unsubscribing for special promos and other communications 

With your confirmation, we send you e-mails of our latest promotions, specials, and discounts. When you no longer want to receive these e-mails, you can click the "opt-out" option at the bottom of our e-mails. Doing so will remove your name from our e-mailing list. 

####  How do we protect your personal information? 

You can rest assured that the highest standards are used by DriveWire to secure your personal and account information. We know how much customers value their privacy. That's why we invested in advanced firewall technology to protect your personal information. 

For better service, we contracted specialists to handle your orders. We have different third-party affiliates that specialize in banking, processing, distribution, and order fulfillment. To fulfill their functions, these third-party affiliates receive some of your personal information. For instance, delivery affiliates will need your address to deliver your order. 

On the site, your account information is kept on a secure server. Also, your personal information is not accessible through any physical means. 

####  DriveWire Cookies

Whenever you use our site, we install cookies on your computer to give you a more customized shopping experience. 

A cookie is a small data text file that is installed in your hard drive, which allows our servers to recognize you whenever you visit DriveWire. 

A DriveWire cookie gives you a unique identification number that makes your shopping experience easier. This allows you to retrieve prior-made shopping carts and helps us administer our services. If your browser is not set to accept cookies, then you will be unable to avail of our services. 

Our third-party affiliates also place cookies on our site. We have no access or control over these cookies. This privacy policy serves as a disclaimer that we are only responsible for DriveWire cookies, and that does not include third-party cookies on the site. 

####  On minors browsing the site

DriveWire is meant for the use of adults (18-years-old and over). However, minors are more than capable of collecting online contact information to use the site without parental consent. Upon discovering that such an incident has occurred, such contact information will be deleted and disregarded. 

#### Third-party privacy policies 

Other sites accessible from DriveWire have their own privacy policies. It is important that you read third-party affiliate privacy polices because these sites are not owned and controlled by DriveWire. We are not liable for the information practices of our third-party affiliates. 

Third-party affiliates may send cookies and collect personal information from you. DriveWire cannot control this information distribution. If you have questions and concerns, you should direct them to the concerned third-party affiliate.
