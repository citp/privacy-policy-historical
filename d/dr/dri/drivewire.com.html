<b><a name="1">1. What
information does Drivewire.com collect from you?</a></b>
<br><br>

In order to better provide
you with numerous products and services, Drivewire.com collects two types of
information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and
Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting
information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized
experience while using our site. 
<br><br>

Personally Identifiable
Information This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who
you are. Personal information is requested when you order a product or service,
register for a Gift List, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and
send us feedback. This information might include your name, billing address,
shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment
information, and product details. With this information, Drivewire.com can fill
your orders and better provide you with personalized services. 
<br><br>

Non-Personally
Identifiable Information This refers to information that does not by itself
identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based
upon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information is compiled
and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may
include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just
came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your
Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of
documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an
identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks
like the web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP
address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is
automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web,
allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP
addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. 
<br><br>

<a href="#Overview:" class="bookmarklinks">Back to Top</a>
<br><br>

<b><a name="2">2. Where
do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</a></b>
<br><br>

Our primary goal in
collecting personal information is to provide Drivewire.Com visitors with a
superior customized online experience. We use the customer contact information
to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to
send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and
administer our systems. 
<br><br>

Limited demographic data
is also collected at our site from our third party advertising server, who
provides us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server,
along with pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of the Drivewire.com
visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences.
Drivewire.com does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages
viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from
our server log files, from contests, drawings or surveys. We will use this data
to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and
promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product
offerings, and to customize our Site's content, layout, and services. We
receive summary, but not individual, reports from our third party ad server,
which tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon. 
<br><br>

<b>We gather information
in the following ways: </b>
<br><br>

<b>Online
Surveys and Polling<br>
</b>In order to
improve our services to you, we ask some of our customers to voluntarily
complete surveys, which may be collected by an independent third party.
Individual survey answers are confidential, although Non-Personally
Identifiable Information is collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do
not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked. 
<br><br>

<b>Contests and
Sweepstakes<br>
</b>When you enter a
contest or other promotion, we may ask you for contact information such as your
name, address and e-mail address in order to administer the contest, to send
you promotional e-mails, notify winners and make the winners' list publicly
available pursuant to certain states' laws. Your consent to such promotional
use and disclosure of this information is a condition of your participation. As
a condition of receiving any prize, you will be required to submit an Affidavit
of Eligibility, for us to ensure that you are eligible to receive the prize
according to the Contest Rules. 
<br><br>

<b>Cookies<br>
</b>We use cookies in
the operation of our site; to find out what cookies are and how we use them see
the section 8, “Use of Cookies”. 
<br><br>

<h5>Contact Information and Third Party Data </h5>

If you
contact Drivewire.com or our customer service representatives by telephone,
e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your correspondence or comments. If
you report a problem with our site, we may collect such information in a file
specific to you. If you contact us through our feedback area or by calling one
of our customer service representatives, we may ask for your name and e-mail
address in order to send you a reply. If other users or third parties send us
correspondence about your activities or purchases on our site, we may keep the
information in a file specific to you. We use a third party to help us provide
customer service. In order to help you most effectively, we provide them with
your order information. 
<br><br>

<a href="#Overview:" class="bookmarklinks">Back to Top</a>
<br><br>

<b><a name="3">3. With
whom do we share your information?</a></b>
<br><br>

The information collected
by Drivewire.com is used only for the limited purposes of processing orders,
keeping you informed about your order status, for statistical purposes, for
improving our site and its performance, and to notify you of products or
special offers that may be of interest to you. We will disclose your Personally
Identifiable Information to third parties to charge your credit card, fill your
order, deliver your order, provide customer service and deliver promotional
e-mails to you from Drivewire.com. For example, we must release your credit
card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment; and release your
address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered.

<br><br>

We do not sell, trade, or
rent your personal information to others. We may provide Non-Personally
Identifiable Information about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and
related site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not
include any Personally Identifiable Information. We may release account
information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to
enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property,
and safety of Drivewire.com, our users, or others. 
<br><br>

Except as otherwise stated
in this Policy, at present Drivewire.com does not disclose its customers'
Personally Identifiable Information to other merchants. In the future, with
your permission, we may provide some customer information to companies with
products or services that may be of interest to you. This would be for
marketing purposes only and no credit card information would be given.
Occasionally Drivewire.com may be required by law enforcement or judicial
authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate
governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information
upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement
investigation. Drivewire.com fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in
identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the
right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good
faith believe to be unlawful. 
<br><br>

You will be notified when
any third party that is not our agent/service provider collects your personal
information, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share
your information with that party.
<br><br>

We reserve the right to
disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when
we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply
with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web
site.
<br><br>

<a href="#Overview:" class="bookmarklinks">Back to Top</a>
<br><br>

<b><a name="4">4.
Ownership Of Information.</a></b>
<br><br>

Once you have submitted
information and it is received in the Drivewire.com database, all submitted
information, including your name, e-mail address, home address, phone number,
financial and credit information becomes the property of AUTO SERVICE GROUP
INC. This information may be passed as needed on to our dealer and fulfillment
partners, finance partners and affiliates for the execution of the order,
service or request. Any information received by our partners is subject to
their respective privacy policy on customer information. Our partners use this
information to process your order, to approve your credit and to provide
valuable services. If you choose to opt out on our website we will not and
cannot provide your information to partners, thus being unable to complete your
request. If you do not opt out on our website at the initial time of service
request, any subsequent requests to opt out of future partner communications must
be made directly to the Partner. 
<br><br>

<a href="#Overview:" class="bookmarklinks">Back to Top</a>
<br><br>

<b><a name="5">5. How
can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information?</a></b>
<br><br>

We believe you should have
the ability to access and edit the personal information that you have provided
to us. During the online ordering process you can review, change, or delete the
information that you have submitted. You may change any of your personal
information in your account online at any time. We encourage you to promptly
update your information if it changes. 
<br><br>

If your personally
identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you
may correct, update, or delete by making the change on our account information
page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@Drivewire.com">support@Drivewire.com</a>. or by contacting
us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.
<br><br>

Opt Out -
We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally
identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this
information.&nbsp; For example, when you purchase a product/service but do not wish
to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your
preference on our order checkout form. 
<br><br>

If you no
longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may
opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each
newsletter or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Drivewire.com">privacy@Drivewire.com</a> or you may
contact us at 949-387-1900 or by mail at Drivewire.com 18021 Sky Park Circle
Suite K Irvine CA 92614 to opt-out.

<br><br>

<b><a name="6">6. What
are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your
information?</a></b>
<br><br>

We may from time to time
send you e-mail or other communications regarding current promotions, specials
and new additions to the Drivewire.com site. You may "opt-out," or
unsubscribe from our newsletters by following the unsubscribe instructions in
any e-mail you receive from us. After doing so, Drivewire.com users will not
receive future communications or mailings unless they open a new account or
enter a contest.

<br><br>

<b><a name="7">7. What
security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration
of your information?</a></b>
<br><br>

At Drivewire.com you can
be assured that your personal and account information is secure, consistent
with current industry standards. The importance of security for all Personally
Identifiable Information associated with our customers is of utmost concern to
us. Our secure servers protect the information using advanced firewall
technology. 
<br><br>

In order to most
efficiently serve you, established third party banking, processing agents and
distribution institutions handle credit card transactions and order
fulfillment. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your
credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order. 
<br><br>

When you access your
