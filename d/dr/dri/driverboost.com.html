<p><strong>Why DriverBoost Collects Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>DriverBoost only collects your Personal Information where it 
    is required to provide you the best services and products available. By 
    maintaining an accurate customer database, we are able to send 
    notifications via e-mail to keep you informed about the status of your 
    orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices. These 
    messages are essential to the maintenance of your subscription and the 
    functionality of our products and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why DriverBoost Collects Device Hardware and Software Inventory Information</strong></p>
<p>DriverBoost collects your device’s hardware and software 
    inventory information in order to deliver our driver and other 
    device-associated recommendations, download access, and installation 
    automations provided in our software.&nbsp; The hardware and software 
    inventory data is essential for our software and servers to match the 
    best updates for a particular system on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; We 
    retain this information in order to continuously improve our matching 
    intelligence based on aggregating and normalizing the data collected 
    across all systems.</p>
<p><strong>What Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>DriverBoost collects your Personal Information at a variety of
     points, including when you place an order, (which may require you to 
    provide personal information, including a credit card number, to our 
    commerce providers) register software, request services or take part in 
    other activities on our Web site. For example, we often ask for your 
    Personal Information when you are conferring with one of our customer 
    support technicians, downloading a new product or program update, 
    registering your software or purchasing a product. During these 
    interactions we will collect Personal Information relevant to your 
    transacting with DriverBoost, such as your name, mailing 
    address, e-mail address, shipping address and credit card information 
    along with information about the DriverBoost products you 
    own, such as the activation code or key code, date of purchase and 
    information relating to a support issue. We use this information for 
    billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing 
    an order, we will use this information to contact you. When you 
    register, you will be provided with an option to opt-out of receiving 
    promotional information on our products and services. We will not use 
    your personal information for anything other than what you have intended
     it for. Please be aware that if you prefer not to provide us with your 
    Personal Information, because such information may be necessary for us 
    to provide certain services, we may not be able to, or may choose not 
    to, make such services available to you.</p>
<p><strong>Device Hardware and Software Inventory Information</strong></p>
<p>The scanning technology present in our software is designed to collect all 
    hardware ID’s and software signatures present in the system and passes 
    this data back to our servers.&nbsp; We use this information so that our
     servers can respond back to our software with a list of recommended 
    drivers and other software relevant to the discovered hardware.&nbsp; 
    While in trial-mode (pre-purchase) this information is not tied in any 
    way to any personal information.&nbsp; Post-purchase and after 
    activation of the software the inventory data is linked to your personal
     information so that it can be shown as historical information in the 
    software, used as part of our free driver backup service, &nbsp;as well 
    as historical scan information available in your personalized <a href="https://secure.driversupport.com/account/">https://secure.driversupport.com/account/</a>
     web portal (all features of our software and services).&nbsp; This 
    information is also used to handle any technical, product, or customer 
    support requests that you may send to us.&nbsp; Please be aware that if 
    you prefer not to provide this inventory information, our software will 
    be unable to provide any of our services.</p>
