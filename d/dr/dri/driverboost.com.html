			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			
		  <p><strong>Effective Date:  05/21/2012</strong></p>
		  <p> BOOST SOFTWARE INC. (“BOOST SOFTWARE INC.”) privacy policy  (“Privacy Policy”) covers the collection and use of personal information  (“Personal Information”) that we may gather any time you interact with us, such  as when you visit our Web site, purchase a BOOST SOFTWARE INC. products, or  when you contact our customer support or sales departments. This policy  describes our data privacy practices, including what type of information is  gathered, how BOOST SOFTWARE INC. uses the information, and how we safeguard  your Personal Information when you submit it to us at www.driversboost.com. At BOOST  SOFTWARE INC., protecting your privacy is important to us. After all, online  privacy and security is what we’re all about.&nbsp;<strong>You expressly consent to  the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy  Policy.&nbsp; Personal Information may be processed by BOOST SOFTWARE INC. in  the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the  United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less  stringent.</strong></p>
		  <p><strong>Why BOOST SOFTWARE INC. Collects Personal Information</strong></p>
			<p>			  BOOST SOFTWARE INC. only collects your Personal Information  where it is required to provide you the best services and products available.  By maintaining an accurate customer database, we are able to send notifications  via e-mail to keep you informed about the status of your orders or accounts and  to provide updates and technical notices. These messages are essential to the  maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our products and  services.</p>
		  <p><strong>Why BOOST SOFTWARE INC. Collects Device Hardware and  Software Inventory Information</strong></p>
			<p> BOOST SOFTWARE INC. collects your device’s hardware and  software inventory information in order to deliver our driver and other  device-associated recommendations, download access, and installation  automations provided in our software.&nbsp; The hardware and software inventory  data is essential for our software and servers to match the best updates for a  particular system on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; We retain this information in  order to continuously improve our matching intelligence based on aggregating  and normalizing the data collected across all systems.</p>
			<p>              <strong>What Information We Collect</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
			<p>              BOOST SOFTWARE INC. collects your Personal Information at a  variety of points, including when you place an order, (which may require you to  provide personal information, including a credit card number, to our commerce  providers) register software, request services or take part in other activities  on our Web site. For example, we often ask for your Personal Information when you  are conferring with one of our customer support technicians, downloading a new  product or program update, registering your software or purchasing a product.  During these interactions we will collect Personal Information relevant to your  transacting with BOOST SOFTWARE INC., such as your name, mailing address,  e-mail address, shipping address and credit card information along with  information about the BOOST SOFTWARE INC. products you own, such as the  activation code or key code, date of purchase and information relating to a  support issue. We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your  orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to  contact you. When you register, you will be provided with an option to opt-out  of receiving promotional information on our products and services. We will not  use your personal information for anything other than what you have intended it  for. Please be aware that if you prefer not to provide us with your Personal  Information, because such information may be necessary for us to provide  certain services, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, make such  services available to you.</p>
			<p>              <strong>Device Hardware and Software Inventory Information</strong></p>
			<p> The scanning technology present in our software is designed  to collect all hardware ID’s and software signatures present in the system and  passes this data back to our servers.&nbsp; We use this information so that our  servers can respond back to our software with a list of recommended drivers and  other software relevant to the discovered hardware.&nbsp; While in trial-mode  (pre-purchase) this information is not tied in any way to any personal  information.&nbsp; Post-purchase and after activation of the software the  inventory data is linked to your personal information so that it can be shown  as historical information in the software, used as part of our free driver  backup service, &nbsp;as well as historical scan information available in your  personalized&nbsp;<a href="http://account.driversupport.com/">http://account.driversupport.com/</a>&nbsp;web  portal (all features of our software and services).&nbsp; This information is  also used to handle any technical, product, or customer support requests that  you may send to us.&nbsp; Please be aware that if you prefer not to provide  this inventory information, our software will be unable to provide any of our  services.</p>
			<p>              <strong>Regarding Children</strong></p>
			<p>			  BOOST SOFTWARE INC. does not intentionally gather Personal  Information about visitors who are under the age of 13.</p>

The email address is  stored log files by a third party, but is not utilized in any way by them and  remains our information.</p>
			<p> If our company or our assets are acquired by another  company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and  it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information  as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
