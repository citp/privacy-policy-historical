"Cookies" are small data files that many Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them.

Lead Forms: In certain other features, you may be presented with a form that requests, among other items, your name and contact information. When this form is submitted by you the information you provide is stored on our computers, so that we have a record of what we have sent to our partners. We also serve a cookie to you telling us where that information is maintained, so that we can "pre-fill" your name and contact information for you when in the future you call up a similar form.
