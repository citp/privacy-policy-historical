  * Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload content or send messages through the Dripbook Websites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any content that you submit to the Dripbook Websites (other than your e-mail address and payment information) may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public. 
  * We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major changes to the Dripbook Websites or for customer service purposes). 
  * We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Dripbook Websites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.

##  When Dripbook Discloses Information 

  * We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 
  * We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. 
  * We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Dripbook Websites. 
  * We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. 
  * Dripbook.com also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Dripbook.com believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Dripbook.com, our Users or others.

##  Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites 

Ads appearing on the Dripbook Websites may be delivered to users by Dripbook.com or one of our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Dripbook.com and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

Dripbook.com does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Dripbook Websites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you. Dripbook's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. 

##  Our Commitment To Data Security 

Dripbook.com uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Dripbook.com and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Dripbook.com makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

If Dripbook.com learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Dripbook.com may post a notice on the Dripbook Websites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us. 

##  Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy 

In order to register for an account on the Dripbook Websites, a user must be over the 18 years of age and agree to abide by and be bound by our Terms of Use. Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Dripbook.com does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Dripbook Websites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Dripbook Websites at any time or in any manner. If Dripbook.com learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Dripbook Websites without verified parental consent, then Dripbook.com will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. 

##  In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy 

In the event that Dripbook.com is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
