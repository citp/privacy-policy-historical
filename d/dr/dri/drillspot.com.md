When you make a purchase through www.DrillSpot.com, we ask that you provide your name, email address, billing and shipping address, credit card information, and phone number. Credit card transactions are handled by a reputable payment processor. Our processor receives the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card prior to order fulfillment. Our processor is under strict obligation not to sell or share any of your personal information.

DrillSpot® fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities and information that we reasonably believe to be unlawful. 

Checkout:  
For your future convenience, we store your billing and shipping information on our secured server.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. DrillSpot® asks for company name and suite number for shipping purposes only. All shipments are sent via UPS, which requires a business name and valid suite number when applicable.
