Postmedia Network’s divisions and affiliates may share personal information with each other in order to fulfill the purposes that you have consented to.  We may also share your personal information with third party service providers as necessary for them to provide services on our behalf.  Some service providers may be located outside of Canada where personal information may be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions.
