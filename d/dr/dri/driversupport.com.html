                        processed by PC Drivers Headquarters in the country where it was 
                        collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Why PC Drivers Headquarters Collects Personal Information</strong></p>

                        notifications via e-mail to keep you informed about the status of your 
                        orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices. These

                    <p><strong>Why PC Drivers Headquarters Collects Device Hardware and Software Inventory Information</strong></p>
                    <p>PC Drivers Headquarters collects your device’s hardware and software 
                        inventory information in order to deliver our driver and other

                        automations provided in our software.&nbsp; The hardware and software 
                        inventory data is essential for our software and servers to match the 
                        best updates for a particular system on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; We 
                        retain this information in order to continuously improve our matching 
                        intelligence based on aggregating and normalizing the data collected 
                        across all systems.</p>
                    <p><strong>What Information We Collect</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
                    <p>PC Drivers Headquarters collects your Personal Information at a variety of
                         points, including when you place an order, (which may require you to 
                        provide personal information, including a credit card number, to our 
                        commerce providers) register software, request services or take part in 
                        other activities on our Web site. For example, we often ask for your 
                        Personal Information when you are conferring with one of our customer 
                        support technicians, downloading a new product or program update, 
                        registering your software or purchasing a product. During these 
                        interactions we will collect Personal Information relevant to your 
                        transacting with PC Drivers Headquarters, such as your name, mailing 
                        address, e-mail address, shipping address and credit card information 
                        along with information about the PC Drivers Headquarters products you 
                        own, such as the activation code or key code, date of purchase and 
                        information relating to a support issue. We use this information for 
                        billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing 
                        an order, we will use this information to contact you. When you 
                        register, you will be provided with an option to opt-out of receiving 
                        promotional information on our products and services. We will not use 
                        your personal information for anything other than what you have intended
                         it for. Please be aware that if you prefer not to provide us with your 
                        Personal Information, because such information may be necessary for us 
                        to provide certain services, we may not be able to, or may choose not 
                        to, make such services available to you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Device Hardware and Software Inventory Information</strong></p>
                    <p>The scanning technology present in our software is designed to collect all 
                        hardware ID’s and software signatures present in the system and passes 
                        this data back to our servers.&nbsp; We use this information so that our
                         servers can respond back to our software with a list of recommended 
                        drivers and other software relevant to the discovered hardware.&nbsp; 
                        While in trial-mode (pre-purchase) this information is not tied in any 
                        way to any personal information.&nbsp; Post-purchase and after 
                        activation of the software the inventory data is linked to your personal
                         information so that it can be shown as historical information in the 
                        software, used as part of our free driver backup service, &nbsp;as well 
                        as historical scan information available in your personalized <a href="https://secure.driversupport.com/account/">https://secure.driversupport.com/account/</a>
                         web portal (all features of our software and services).&nbsp; This 
                        information is also used to handle any technical, product, or customer 
                        support requests that you may send to us.&nbsp; Please be aware that if 
                        you prefer not to provide this inventory information, our software will 
                        be unable to provide any of our services.</p>

                        We use credit card processing companies to bill you for goods and 
                        services, an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf and
                         a customer support provider to supply live assisted-support. These 
                        companies do not retain share, store or use personally identifiable 
                        information for any other purposes.</p>
                    <p>PC Drivers Headquarters 
                        maintains this information; but we reserve the right to disclose your 
                        Personal Information as required by law and when we believe that 
                        disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a 
                        judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our 
                        Website. If you require assistance, and would like someone to follow-up 
                        with you, then you will be asked to provide an email address. The email 
                        address is stored log files by a third party, but is not utilized in any
                         way by them and remains our information.</p>
                    <p>If our company or our 
                        assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the 
                        Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and 
                        obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this 
                        Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p><strong>How We Communicate with You</strong></p>
                    <p>PC Drivers Headquarters has an optional e-mail service for customers who 
                        wish to periodically receive promotional information, such as general 
                        product, service and PC Drivers Headquarters news. Users can sign up for
                         emails through one of the following processes: (1) an online Purchase; 
                        (2) registering through the full application; (3) registering through 
                        the trial application; and (4) signing up on the PC Drivers Headquarters
                         website.</p>
                    <p>Customers are provided the option to opt-out within each
                         e-mail. If you no longer wish to receive PC Drivers Headquarters 
                        communications, you may “unsubscribe” from our mailing program at any 
                        time in the following ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By clicking on the auto-unsubscribe link included in each e-mail</li>
                        <li>By contacting our technical support department at support@drivershq.com</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>We will then update our database and take reasonable measures so that no 
                        further promotional correspondence should be sent to the e-mail address.
                         You may, however, still receive transactional messages.</p>
                    <p><strong>Transactional Messages</strong></p>
                    <p>PC Drivers Headquarters sends required notifications via e-mail to keep 
                        you informed of the status of your orders or accounts and to provide 
                        updates and technical notices. This service is used for messages that 
                        are important for the maintenance of your subscription and the 
                        functionality of our services. When you purchase or register a product 
                        online, we require an e-mail address for completion of the transaction, 
                        which we will use for these communications. In order to stop receiving 
                        these notifications, please contact our technical support team at 
                        support@drivershq.com. You will be opted out of further communications 
                        within 10 business days.</p>

                        effort to keep your Personal Information accurate for the purposes for
