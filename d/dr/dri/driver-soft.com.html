      <p align="left">Driver-Soft.com processes personal information on our   servers in the United States of America and in other countries.

      <p align="left">Choices for personal information<br>
        When you sign up   for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide   personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the   purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to   such use. </p>
      <p align="left">If we propose to use personal information for any   purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific   service notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of   personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use   sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy   and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior   consent. </p>
      <p align="left">Information security <br>
        We take appropriate security   measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,   disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data   collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as   physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where   we store personal data. </p>
      <p align="left">We restrict access to personal information to   Driver-Soft.com. employees, contractors and agents who need to know that   information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These   individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to   discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet   these obligations. </p>
      <p align="left">Data integrity <br>
        Driver-Soft.com processes personal   information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance   with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review   our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only   collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve   our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information   we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to   update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. </p>
      <p align="left">Changes to this policy<br>
        Please note that this   Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights   under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes   will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if   the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including,   for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of   this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and   we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your   review. <br>
