    When you sign up for a   particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal   information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose   for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. </p>
  <p align="left">If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other   than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific service notices, we   will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information   for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for   purposes other than those described in this Policy and/or in the specific   service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. </p>
  <p align="left">Information security <br>
    We take appropriate security measures to   protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or   destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection,   storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical   security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store   personal data. </p>
  <p align="left">We restrict access to personal information to Driver-Soft.com.   employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to   operate, develop or improve our services.

We will not reduce your rights under this Policy   without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.   Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are   significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain   services, email notification of Policy changes).
