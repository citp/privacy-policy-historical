We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We also urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website or App. The Member Forums, while part of a "Member-only" community, are message boards that become accessible and public once you post your messages. The information you share may be viewed by other users of the Website or App, and may result in unwanted e-mail or contacts from third parties.

Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk and DrFuhrman.com is not responsible.

ALTHOUGH WE WILL TAKE (AND REQUIRE OUR THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS TO TAKE) REASONABLE SECURITY PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM AND STORED ON THE SITE, BECAUSE OF THE OPEN NATURE OF THE INTERNET, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED ON OUR SERVERS, TRANSMITTED TO OR FROM A USER, OR OTHERWISE IN OUR CARE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY SAFE FROM INTRUSION BY OTHERS, SUCH AS HACKERS. ACCORDINGLY, WE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY THEFT OR LOSS OF, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DAMAGE TO, OR INTERCEPTION OF ANY DATA OR COMMUNICATIONS.

## Legal Basis for Processing European Individual’s Personal Data
