		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>World Media Group, LLC ("Company") manages websites including the Lawer.com website and provides this privacy policy because we value your right to privacy. This policy is effective as of January 1, 2009 and governs the collection of personal information through our websites on or after this date.</p>

<p>This policy describes the types of information we may collect from visitors and how that information is used. Please read this policy carefully before providing us with any personal information. If you have questions about this policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@world.com">privacy@world.com</a> </p>

<p>We offer information at our website that is in the public domain as a service to our users seeking easier and faster ways to access information.  The doctor database used on this site was licensed from another company. Data may be outdated due to the date and the method of the collection. If you find data that is inaccurate please contact us at <a href="mailto:compliance@world.com">compliance@world.com</a> and we can verify and then update the directory.</p>

<p><b>Information we collect.</b></p>

<p><b>Unregistered users</b><br>
You can register at some of our sites to take advantage of personalization features.</p>

<p>If you do not register, then the information we collect from you when you visit the site is limited. We log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site and track usage statistics. Your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may be the same. It would be extremely difficult for us to identify you through your IP address, and we make no attempt to do so. If you reached our site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, we may log that information. All of this information is collected and used only in the aggregate.</p>

<p>We may place a small "cookie" file on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through our Web site and to determine whether you have visited us before. Unless you register with us, the cookie contains no personally identifiable information. We may use cookies to help us understand how visitors use our site, and to help us to improve our site. You may elect not to accept cookies by changing settings in your browser. </p>

<p><b>Registered users</b><br>
If you choose to register with us when you visit our site, you'll be able to add content to certain of our sites. For example, you may post your own comments on hundreds of popstars listed at PopStar.com. At certain sites, you can provide your email address to receive newsletters and other information. For example, at Asia.com we will send you travel booking confirmations.</p>

<p>If you register with us, we will collect personal information from you in addition to the non-personal information described above. That personal information may include your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, travel preferences, user name and password, as well as contact information for other people that you provide to us. The information we collect may vary, but we only collect the information that you manually enter into our forms or otherwise authorize us to collect. We may store all or some of that information in a cookie file on your hard drive, so that our system will recognize you each time you visit our site. In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized Web site, without requiring you to log into our site every time you visit. To improve services and enhance personalization, we may periodically obtain information about you from other independent third-party sources and add it to your registration information. Additionally, authorized personnel may update your registration information to accurately reflect any new information included in communications received from you.</p>

<p>If you reach our site through one of our partners and you choose to register with us, we may be required to give our partner your registration information. </p>

<p><b>How we use the personal information we collect.</b><br>
Registering allows you to personalize our Web site so that it is most useful to you. It also allows you to log into our site automatically each time you visit, rather than manually typing your user name and password every time. We may use your personal information to periodically contact you with news or important information, to provide you with other information or invitations related to your membership, and to request your feedback on our site. In addition to these periodic updates, we may email you additional marketing materials that you have requested. These might include opt-in newsletters and partner offers. You may opt-out of any or all marketing communications in any commercial e-mail we send or at any time (opt-out links are provided in all emails).</p>

<p>We may also use certain information that you provide in order to present you with advertising that you may find interesting. This benefits both of us. It benefits us because advertising helps pay the bills, and we can charge our advertisers more if they know that their ads will be seen by somebody more likely to find it useful. It benefits you because you see advertising that is more likely to be interesting to you and because it permits us to offer you a broader range of free services. </p>

<p><b>Disclosure of your personal information.</b><br>
We may share some of your personally identifiable information with our parent company, our subsidiaries and sister companies. We do not place restrictions on the use of personal information by our parent company, subsidiaries, or affiliates but require that they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications, and must give you an opportunity in any such email that they send to choose not to receive such promotional e-mail messages in the future.</p>

<p>We also may share your personal information with third-parties engaged to provide services to us (such as market research firms, marketing services providers and advertising agencies). We will ensure those parties to agree to use any such personally-identifiable data solely for the purpose of providing the specified services to us. We must cooperate with legal authorities, and may in some circumstances be required to disclose personally identifiable information in response to requests from law enforcement authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. We can turn over information about you if we believe we must in order to prevent a violation of the law, and by accepting this policy, you consent to our doing so, in our sole discretion. You also consent to our disclosing information about you in the course of legal proceedings if we are legally required to do so, if we reasonably believe that doing so may mitigate our liability, or if doing so will assist us in enforcing our legal rights. We also may share your information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, and in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. </p>

<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Policy.</b><br>
We reserve the right to change this policy should we deem it advisable to do so. If we make material changes that will affect personal information we have already collected from you, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and give you the opportunity to amend or cancel your registration.</p>
