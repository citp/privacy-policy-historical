  Dr. Leonard’s Healthcare Corp. (“Dr. Leonard’s”) respects your privacy.  This privacy policy describes the ways that Dr. Leonard’s collects and uses personal information at [www.drleonards.com](http://www.drleonards.com/).  By using this web site, you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this privacy policy.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

You may visit Dr. Leonard’s web site anonymously.  However, we offer special features that require you to submit personal information to participate.  For example, if you make a purchase using a credit card, we will need to collect information such as your credit card number and billing address to complete that transaction.  You may also register at the site by submitting your name, email address and zip code.  If you do not wish to provide us with that information, we cannot provide those services to you.

We may use your personal information to send you information about goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  At our discretion, we may share your personal information with third parties who may also contact you.  Please note that we advise our partners to use your information in accordance with this policy.  In the unlikely event that some or all of Dr. Leonard’s assets are sold, Dr. Leonard’s will transfer all personal information to the acquiring party.  Finally, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties in order to comply with law, to protect our rights in or the safety of our web site, or to protect the safety or rights of other users of our web sites.

You may opt out of future communications from Dr. Leonard’s by clicking on the link located at the bottom of our email messages.  Please note that certain communications, i.e., those relating to purchases, do not provide the opportunity to opt out as they are necessary to complete the transaction with you. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

_Cookies_

To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a standard feature found in browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of anonymous user ID that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read data off your hard drive. 

We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. We may share this data with third parties to achieve those goals.  In. addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our sites visited by our users. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies. 

**Children’s Information**

We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Dr. Leonard’s web site is not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may change this privacy policy at any time by posting revisions to this web site. Your continued use of this web site after any changes have been posted indicates your agreement to the revised terms. Accordingly, we urge you to review this privacy policy at the start of each use of this web site.  We will also list the date of the last revision at the top of the privacy policy.

**Confidentiality and Security**

We use modern technology to protect the information you submit.  All personally identifiable user information is stored on secured servers and behind a firewall.  However, no security system is completely impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. 

**Contact Information**

You may review or delete any personal information we retain about you by sending an email to our Privacy Officer at the address listed below.  However, if you are contacted by one of our partners, you will need to alert them that you wish your information to be deleted. **  **Please note that it is sometimes not possible to erase all copies of your personal data such as that data in storage located on a back up drive.
