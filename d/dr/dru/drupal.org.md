# Drupal.org Privacy Policy | Drupal.org

_Last updated: 23 May 2018_

We value your privacy and strive to protect your personal information. Please read this Policy to understand what types of information we collect from you, for what purposes and what choices you have regarding our collection of your information.

This policy covers Drupal.org website and all *.drupal.org subsites (collectively, the "Website"). By accessing, using or posting information to this Website, you agree to this Privacy Policy and the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms).

As stated in Section F of our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms), Drupal.org serves an international community, and so we are committed to complying with any applicable data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU's [General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)](https://www.eugdpr.org/).

### **Human Readable Summary**

_Disclaimer: This summary is not itself a part of the Privacy Policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding privacy rights and regulations. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to the legal language of our Privacy Policy._

In plain language, regulations such as GDPR define the following roles, rights, and responsibilities:

  * **Data Subject** \- this is you, the end user.
  * **Data Controller** \- this is us, the Drupal Association as the owners and operators of Drupal.org and its sub-sites.
  * **Data Processor** \- any other organization that processes personal data on behalf of the Data Controller.



#### Rights of the Data Subject

  * **Right to be Informed** \- A data subject has the right to know whether personal information is being processed; where; and for what purpose.  

This information is outlined in the section below titled "Information We Collect About You" and "How we Use Your Information".

  * **Right to Access** \- A data subject has a right to access the information about them that is stored by the Data Controller.  

This information is outlined in the section below titled "Information We Collect About You" and "How we Use Your Information".

  * **Right to Rectification** \- A data subject has the right to correct any errors in the data about them. This can be done by editing your user account, or contacting the Drupal Association directly.  
 
  * **Right to Restrict Processing** \- A data subject has the right to request that data not be processed, and yet also not be deleted by the Data Controller.  
 
  * **Right to Object** \- A data subject has the right to opt out of marketing, processing based on legitimate interest, or processing for research or statistical purposes.  
 
  * **Right to be Forgotten** \- Also known as the right to revoke consent, the right to be forgotten states that a data subject has the right to request erasure of data, the cessation of processing by the controller, and halting processing of the data by third party processors. 

The conditions for this, as outlined in article 17, include the data no longer being relevant to original purposes for processing, or a data subjects withdrawing consent.

It should also be noted that this right requires controllers to compare the subjects' rights to "the public interest in the availability of the data" when considering such requests.

This information is outlined in the sections below titled "Accessing and Correcting Your Information".

  * **Data Portability** \- A data subject has the right to receive a copy of their data in a 'commonly used and machine readable format.' 

This information is outlined in the sections below titled "Your Choices About Use and Disclosure of Your Information" and "Accessing and Correcting Your Information".




#### Responsibilities of the Data Controller and Data Processors

  * **Privacy by Design** \- _'The controller shall..implement appropriate technical and organisational measures..in an effective way.. in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects'._ Article 23 of the GDPR calls for controllers to hold and process only the data absolutely necessary for the completion of its duties, as well as limit the access to personal data to those who need it to carry out these duties.  
 
  * **Breach Notification** \- The Data Controller must notify the appropriate data processing authority and any affected end user of any breach that might result in 'risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals' within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. 

A Data Processor must notify the Data Controller of any breach 'without undue delay.'  
 

  * **Data protection officer** \- A Data Controller or Processor must appoint a Data Protection Officer when: a Data Controller represents a public authority; or the core operations of the Controller require regular and systematic monitoring of Subjects on a large scale; or when the Controller's core operations depend on processing a large scale of special categories of data (including but not limited to health data, criminal conviction information, etc).  

The Drupal Association's core operations do not require the Association to establish a Data Protection Officer.

The appropriate method(s) for accessing your information, if any, will depend on which of our websites and services you have visited or used. Depending on the website and service, you may have the ability to view or edit some of your information online, by logging into the website and visiting your account profile page. If you remove information from your user profile, it will stay in backups on our servers for 2 weeks, after which it will be completely removed.

You may also request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year by contacting [help@drupal.org](mailto:help@drupal.org) or in writing to: Drupal Association, Attn: Customer Support - Privacy Inquiry, 3439 NE Sandy Blvd #269, Portland, OR 97232, United States of America. Please allow 30 days for a response.

**We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your account**. We also may not accommodate a request to change or delete information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirements, be contrary to our Terms of Service or any other applicable agreement between you and us, or cause the information to be incorrect.

Upon deletion all private and personally identifying information from your profile will be deleted. The data will stay in backups on our servers for 2 weeks, after which it will be completely removed.

Once deleted, your account is gone and can not be restored.

### **Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Committed to Repositories**

All users acknowledge that some personal identifiable information may be included in code repositories, in particular: names and email addresses associated with commit history.

In accordance with regulations such as GDPR, it is the Drupal Association's position that there is an overriding public interest in the availability of the data included in and associated with commits to our repositories. Because commits to these repositories are decentralized and irrevocable, all users waive the right to be forgotten from repository history, as well as the right to revoke future consent.

If a user wants to protect their PII from being committed to repositories they are encouraged to use a pseudonym and the Drupal.org no-reply email address in their git configuration.
