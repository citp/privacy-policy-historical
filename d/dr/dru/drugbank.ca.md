DrugBank is a unique bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource owned by The Governors of the University of Alberta (the **“University”** ) that combines detailed drug data with comprehensive drug target information.

Delivery of a unique database that combines detailed information about pharmaceutical drugs with drug target information ("Service") to users ( **“Users”** , **“you”** ) requires us to collect and retain certain identifying information.

This Privacy Policy (the **“Policy”** ) sets out how we use, protect, collect and preserve information submitted by Users. Any capitalized terms not defined in the Policy have the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Use, which are available on the DrugBank website (www.drugbank.ca) and should be read in conjunction with the Policy.

By submitting and accessing information through the DrugBank or web based application, be it www.drugbank.ca, www.drugbankplus.com, www.omx.io, or any other website directly directing traffic thereto, (collectively, the **“Platform”** ), you are agreeing to the terms of this Policy.
