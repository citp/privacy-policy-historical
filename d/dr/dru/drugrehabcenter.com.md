This website does not collect any personal information from your computer when browsing this site. Unless you give us written permission to post information on our secure and private Alumni Information Form or request a reply using one of our feedback or reply forms, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other information that identifies you.   
Internet Protocol (IP) Address:  
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet. When you request a page from our site, our server logs your current IP address. We would only use your IP address to help diagnose problems that affect the integrity of our computer systems, not for personal identification of any users. 

  
**Cookies**  
Holistic does not send or set cookies on your machine.

  
**Information Needed to Execute the Transaction You Request:**  
When we need to collect information from you, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to receive information about admission to Holistic, you may fill out the Inquiry Form in the Admissions section which requests information about your name, address, phone number and e-mail address plus a place to check programs you wish to receive information about and a place to write your question, plus questions about how you heard about us (for evaluation of our own marketing practices). We will use your e-mail address only to provide the information you requested, or to communicate news as you requested. If at any time you decide you do not want to receive this information, you may let us know by reply e-mail or use the form to request that we no longer contact you. Providing information to us using any of our on-line forms is voluntary and the information we collect is used only for the purpose for which the information was collected and is not shared with any other companies. 

**  
Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information:**  
When we ask you for personal data in any of our forms on-line information is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line provided you are using an SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer. After information reaches Holistic it is stored on a secure server that resides behind a firewall that is designed to block access from outside the Center.

  
**Holistic Use of Information:**  
We treat the information that you provide to us as confidential information. It is, accordingly, subject to Holistics security procedures and strict corporate policies regarding protection and use of information. We will only disclose this information to individuals at Holistic on a need-to-know basis and person(s) authorized by you. Patient information is additionally protected under the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 42 and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Holistic maintains strict compliance with each of these laws and regulations.

The laws applicable to personal information vary from country to country. The information we process and store is kept in accordance with the applicable United States legal requirements, which may not be as comprehensive as the data protection laws found in other countries, such as those in the European Union. 

**E-Mails and Opt-Out:**  
Our goal is to only send e-mails that are likely to be of interest to you. All e-mail is generated from Holistic and not from an outside third-party e-mail service provider. Holistic does not make e-mail addresses available to any partners in the Holistic Network or to any others for their use. You may at any time request not to receive e-mails from Holistic by replying to any e-mail with your request to opt-out.

This is a United States website and subject to United States law. Holistic will disclose personal health information without your permission only when required by law, or in a good faith belief that such action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful activities to Holistic patients, staff, volunteers, alumni, property (including this site) or to others or as authorized by federal medical privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. 

**Holistic Privacy Statement Changes:**  
In the future, we may need to change the privacy statement for www.drugrehabcenter.com.
