### 1\. Information That We Collect

Drury collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective and former guests, visitors, website visitors and other consumers (“Consumers”), travel and other business partners (“Business Partners”), and individuals who work for us including current, prospective and former employees, contractors and temporary and other seasonal workers (“Team Members”) based on the legal grounds and legitimate business purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

Drury collects Personal Information directly from Consumers, Business Partners, and Team Members and indirectly through third parties and Business Partners such as an online travel agencies, airline or other electronic travel reservation service, staffing agencies and recruiters, and other agencies and service providers. The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from third parties) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Drury and the requirements of applicable law. 

We endeavor to collect Personal Information only relevant for the purposes of processing. Below are the legal bases and some of the ways we collect information and how we use it.

Drury collects Personal Information directly from you when you contact us to make a room reservation or stay at a hotel, buy a gift certificate, apply for a job, or create a personal profile through our Drury Rewards loyalty program or otherwise engage directly with us. You may choose to create a personal profile, to make it more convenient for you to do business with us or stay informed you about products and special offers that may be of interest to you. In addition, in certain circumstances and if you elect, you may include credit or debit card information in your profile, to be used for subsequent reservations to increase reservation speed and eliminate the need for you to repeatedly enter your credit card information. 

We may collect other information about you, such as demographic information (for example, your age or gender), employer information (for example, travel agents and potential applicants), information about your preferences and interests (such as if you prefer a non-smoking room or tour packages) and your hotel-based activities (such as vehicle information, or use of hotel services). We may collect payment information (such as a credit or debit card number), if applicable. If we combine other information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. 

Drury may ask you to provide Personal Information about others. For example, may ask you to provide an employment reference or you may purchase a gift certificate or make a reservation for someone else, or we may allow you to forward information about our products, services, and hotels to another person.

In addition, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records such as from your travel agent in order to provide you with information, services, or products you have requested, to tailor content, to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may interest you, and for other purposes, including marketing demographics. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.

At any time you may seek confirmation regarding whether Drury is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask to receive (port), amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate by calling [1-888-324-1851](tel:18883241851). Drury will make good faith efforts to implement requested changes in our active databases. Note, however, that we may keep information you update or change for Drury’s administrative purposes. Also, it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases, and such requests will be processed in line with local laws. 

Although Drury makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Drury is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Drury determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Drury will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information. 

### 11\. Retention

Drury retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Website(s)s or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our products and services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements and comply with applicable laws. 

### 12\. Protection of Personal Information by Drury

The security of all Personal Information provided to Drury is important to us, and we employ commercially reasonable security methods and technologies to help secure your Personal Information. However, no data transmission over the Internet or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Drury strives to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Drury, and you do so at your own risk. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your own passwords. If you have reason to believe that your passwords or Personal Information is no longer secure, please promptly notify Drury as provided in Section 12 below.

### 14\. Other Rights and Important Information

  1. #### 14.1 Information Regarding Children

Due to the nature of Drury’s business, services and benefits are not marketed to minors. Drury does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16). If we learn that we have collected Personal Information directly from a child under the age of 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16), we will promptly delete that information. 

If you are under the age of 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16), please do not submit any Personal Information to Drury. 

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under the age of 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16), has directly provided us with Personal Information without his or her consent, he or she should contact us and we will delete such information from our files. 

  2. #### 14.2 Third-Party Links and Content

Please note that Drury Website(s) may contain links to other websites, including to our Drury branded credit card partners, for your convenience and information. Drury does not control these third-party websites or their privacy practices, which may differ from those set out in this Privacy Policy. Drury is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party sites and does not endorse or make any representations about the third-parties website privacy practices. Any Personal Information you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy. Drury encourages you to review the privacy policy of any company or website before submitting your Personal Information. Some third parties may choose to share their users’ Personal Information with Drury; that sharing is governed by that company’s privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy. 

  3. #### 14.3. Users Residing Outside of the United States and Consent to Transfer

Drury Hotels Company, LLC, the Drury Site and all of our hotels are based on the United States. All Personal Information sent or collected via or by Drury may be stored in the U.S. or anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, in the United States, in the cloud, our servers, the servers of our affiliates or the servers of our service providers. Your Personal Information may be accessible to law enforcement or other authorities pursuant to a lawful request. By providing information to Drury, you consent to the storage of your Personal Information in these locations.

Drury reserves the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy in its discretion at any time and will notify you of material changes by posting the changed or modified Privacy Policy on our Site. We may also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as through contact information you have provided. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy unless otherwise specified and your continued use of the Site after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy (or such other act as specified in the revised Privacy Policy) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected. 

  5. #### 14.5 California Residents

Your California Privacy Rights: Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Drury does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As stated above in this Privacy Policy, Drury provides you with a choice prior to sharing your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Drury offers that choice, Drury does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes. 

If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request by email to [legal@druryhotels.com](mailto:legal@druryhotels.com) or write to us at: 721 Emerson Road, Suite 400, St. Louis, MO 63141 Attn: Legal Department. You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per person each year.
