# Privacy Policy - DrugWatch.com

**Last Updated:** July 2, 2014

The Privacy Policy outlined below discloses the specific ways in which Drugwatch.com functions, how you should use it or can use it, how we collect user information and how that information is handled and protected. Your privacy is important to Drugwatch.com, and we’re committed to making sure it is protected.  We use your information only in the ways described below.

## Agreement to this Policy

By using this website you consent to this Policy, including your consent to our use and disclosure of information about you in the manner described in this Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

Drugwatch.com receives, but does not track, a variety of “personally identifiable information,” including your email address, IP address and and message content. When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to execute a requested transaction or provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. We may ask you for information such as, but not limited to: your name, address, telephone number, and email address to process your submission. You also have the option of also providing information regarding your name, demographics (such as your state and country of residency), operating system, browser, Internet service provider (“ISP”), connection type and email program that you are using. Drugwatch.com also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP Address and the page you requested. Your IP address is not linked to your email address or Drugwatch.com.

Drugwatch.com does not collect your email address unless you actively provide it to the company so that we communicate with you.

When your Web browser or email application requests a Web page from another computer on the Internet it automatically gives that computer the address where the requested information should be sent. This is called your computer’s “IP address.” (IP stands for “Internet protocol.”) For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up ISP, the IP address may be different every time you log on. Drugwatch.com receives your IP address each time you view a Web page from the Site. Your IP address is not linked to your email address or any other personally identifiable information. Your IP address may be used for various purposes, including:

  * to diagnose service or technology problems reported by you that are associated with your IP address.
  * to estimate the total number of users visiting the Site from specific locales, countries or regions of the world.



In certain areas of this website, we require that you provide us with personally identifiable information, in order to be able to use that portion or those portions of this website. For instance, the names and contact information of persons who visit our website will be added to our database so that, for example, they may be contacted in the future regarding Drugwatch.com’s products, services or future opportunities. Such contact may occur by email, telephone or mail, as Drugwatch.com deems appropriate. Drugwatch.com uses your email address for the following purposes:

  * to contact you about Drugwatch.com services or the Site.
  * to notify you when you receive a Drugwatch.com email message.
  * to communicate with you concerning problems or malfunctions you report.



The server collects information about which pages on the site are accessed and the duration of a visitor’s time on the page. Drugwatch.com is able to see how a visitor accessed the site, whether it is through a search engine or a specific advertising banner.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, in accordance with applicable state and federal standards, to protect your personal financial information against risks such as loss, destruction or misuse. These measures include computer safeguards, secured files and buildings, and restrictions on who may access your personal information. In the event of a system compromise, Drugwatch.com will implement all reasonable measures to ensure the integrity of the website’s database is protected and ensure proper notice is provided under the law.

## Log Files

When a Web page on the website is requested, that request (including the date and time) is logged on our servers with information including the IP address of the computer that requested the page.

We use log files for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. IP addresses and access times are not linked to your email address or any other personally identifiable information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and then stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie cannot obtain information from your hard drive, destroy files, or transmit viruses. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser, if your browser’s preferences allow it. To protect your privacy, your browser normally only permits a website to access cookies that it has previously sent to you, but not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

If you request certain services from us, Drugwatch may then attempt to set cookies on your computer and later access those cookies. You can normally refuse cookies by setting preferences in your browser. You do not need to accept cookies in order to use the Drugwatch service.

## Choices about Cookies

You can normally configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) If you reject all cookies, you will still be able to use Drugwatch services. Cookies are used only as an option selected by you that allows us to recall your email address from the cookie that we sent to your computer.

## Data Storage/User Information

All Drugwatch account information (including names, phone numbers, and mailing addresses) and content of email messages are stored on multiple redundant disk storage systems. No removable offline copies or backups are made. If you request deletion of your email address or any other identifiable information, your information will be deactivated and removed from our user registration database within 30 days.

In reviewing the information above, please keep in mind Drugwatch cannot and does not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including other website users and including the manner in which they might use information received either from Drugwatch or independently.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Drugwatch will not sell or rent your email address, name, mailing address or other supplied information to anyone, except as provided in the legal disclaimer below.

## Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information, as required, to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, judicial proceedings, court orders or subpoenas, to enforce our Legal Notices or other agreements, or to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, or to protect the property or safety of our users or others (e.g., to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection etc.), and to ensure the security of our network and services.
