<b>Important explainations regarding privacy and the above charts:</b><br><br>

First off, we do <b>not</b> know who you are unless you tell us. However, when one visits any of our services, their remote IP address is <b>revealed</b> to the respective server(s) along with other various information, such as browser type and referrer.
This information does <b>not</b> reveal a visitor's real identity to us, since IP addresses are often <b>dynamically allocated</b> so one gets a different one each time they login to their ISP or in some instaces their IP address is <b>shared</b> with numerous other on-line users.<br><br>
<b>Importantly</b>, as a general rule, we do <b>not</b> maintain general access logs and we do <b>not</b> log message posting activity, unless indicated otherwise. In regards to error logs, generally only errors of level "critical" and higher are logged. Other lesser errors such as "404 File Not Found" are typically <b>not</b> logged. Error logs are typically kept no more than 24 hours.
<br><br>
In regards to advertisements, we maintain click-through logs of visitors who click on advertisements, such as ad banners. A visitor must actually visit (click-through to) the advertiser to be logged. Click-through logs contains the remote IP address the visitor came from along with the browser type and referrer as reported by their web browser. This information is the same information the advertiser may log from their site, but we log it on our site as well for verification and marketing purposes.
<br><br>
Sales transactions, completed or not, made through our on-line merchants are extensively logged. We retain sales transaction data indefinitely; typically at least three years. Credit card transactions are processed via gateways by various credit card processors. The credit card gateway, credit card processors, credit card issuers, and other associated parties retain various records regarding credit card transactions done through our merchants.
<br><br>
Registration is required for posting messages on our various message board services.
We require a valid and working email address during the registration process.
This email address is kept on-file. However, it is important to note that the email address used for registration often <b>does not correspond to who actually posted a particular message</b>, since some user names are shared, as well as people often change their email addresses, share email addresses, share ISP accounts, etc.
Also, email is <b>not</b> a secure means of communication and may be intercepted or tampered with.
Thus we do <b>not</b> honor requests by third parties for such information, since there is no way to ensure that a particular email address actually belongs to the poster of a particular message; also such information is considered by us to be <b>confidential</b> and is reserved our internal use only.
Furthermore, the content of the message entered by the poster remains the property of the poster and thus we are <b>not</b> responsible for their message content.
<br><br>
Some of our services use cookies in order to give the visitor a better experience. Cookies are special headers that are embedded within some of our webpages, which a visitor's web browser may store locally on the visitor's computer for a period of time ranging from seconds to many years. Cookies set (sent) by our services are only sent back to themselves; they are not revealed to other websites other than our own.
The cookies we set (send) contain little to no personal information and thus they pose little threat to one's privacy.
However, visitors may choose to limit or even disable cookies in their web browser, but note that some features may not function properly.
<br><br>
Email sent to any DrugAbuse.com service or associated entity is retained for an indefinite period. Email shall <b>not</b> be construed as confidential, since such communications may be intercepted or altered by outside parties.
In addition, we do <b>not</b> consider email privileged (we reserve the right to reveal email content to outside parties solely at our option), <b>unless both</b> the sender and the respective DrugAbuse.com services and associated entities to whom the email is addressed have all agreed in writing, <b>prior</b> to the respective email communication(s), that such email communication(s) is to be considered privileged. In summary, we retain email for an indefinite period and we may generally do whatever we wish with email we receive, including email received in error.
<br><br>
To better protect your privacy one may find various anonymizer services such <b>The Anonymizer</b> useful. By accessing through an anonymizer service, we get their remote IP address and other information such as browser type <b>instead</b> of yours.<br><br>

A few points to keep in mind regarding privacy and the internet:<br><br>

<ol>

<li> Legal jurisdiction in many instances is determined by the <b>physical location of the visitor</b> as opposed to where the server is located. Please check your local laws governing content, etc before accessing any website or related service - this is most applicable to persons accessing from locations where freedom of speech and expression are not protected.<br><br>

</li><li> Many ISPs maintain logs including the URLs their users visit, which <b>includes</b> URLs to SSL encrypted webpages, their dial-in port, and some also log the phone number users dial in from among other things.<br><br>

</li><li> Using email, or PM (personal message) services, or IRC and related chat systems will often reveal one's IP address to others. The use of remailers for email, use of anonymizer proxies for the web, use of special proxies for IRC, and encryption are all great preventative measures, but none of these measures are perfect.<br><br>

On a related topic, even if a website or related resource one visits does not maintain logs or is in another jurisdiction, one's privacy may still be at risk, since most ISPs log similar information. In essance the information logged by a person's ISP will often tend to <b>mirror</b> the logs of the websites and other services the person accessed. So persons who are extra concerned about their privacy may wish to consider an anonymous dial-up account or similar in addition to using anonymizer services.<br><br>

</li><li> A fair amount of internet traffic is monitored through <b>NAPs (network access points)</b> as well as in transit by various
governments and intellegence gathering agencies. They are primarily scanning for military and terrorist information.<br><br>

</li><li> With a <b>lot</b> of effort most PGP encoded messages <b>can be decrypted</b> but certainly <b>not in real time</b> which is primarily why
many governments want to control encryption. PGP is still a good idea, but is not foolproof and requires some effort on part of the
persons using it to keep it secure or otherwise risk key infiltration among other things.<br><br>

</li><li> One should be careful with whom they correspond with and what information they reveal to them.
No computer security in the world will protect one from poor judgement. A good defense is to talk in
generalities in regards to one's identity and intentions.

</li></ol>

<b>Bottom line, it is ultimately up to visitors to protect their privacy and understand that there is no such thing as 100% privacy on
the internet nor in the real world for that matter. It all comes down to managing risk and how much one is willing to accept.</b>
