###  **Applicability of this Policy**

This Policy applies to [www.druva.com](https://www.druva.com/) (“Site”) and services owned and operated by Druva. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Sites, services, or any other aspect of Druva’s business.

This Policy does not apply to any third-party applications or software that integrate with Druva’s services through the Druva platform or any other third-party products, services, or businesses. 

If you use the Site and services as part of an entity or organization that has a corporate account with Druva, like your employer or a university (“Customer”), that Customer may have entered into a separate agreement with Druva, which may contain more restrictive terms than what is described in this Policy (“Customer Agreement”).

### **Global Operations and EU-U.S. Privacy Shield**

We operate globally and have offices, partners, and subprocessors around the world to deliver our services. When you use our Site and services, your collected information may be sent to and processed in countries outside your country of residence, including the U.S.  For individuals residing in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and for Personal Data (as defined below) subject to European data protection laws, this includes transfers outside of the EEA. Some of these countries may not have data protection laws that provide an equivalent level of data protection as the laws in your country of residence. 

If Druva transfers Personal Data (as defined below) originating from the European Union (E.U.) to other countries not deemed adequate under applicable data protection laws, we will deploy the following safeguards:

  *  **E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield**. Druva has self-certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. This framework was developed to enable companies to comply with data protection requirements when transferring Personal Data (as defined below) from the E.U. to the U.S. 



To learn more about the Privacy Shield program and to view Druva’s certification, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/list](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list). Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at [https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint), you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S. third-party dispute resolution provider for free at [https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request).

 **E.U. Model Clauses**. Druva offers E.U. Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses, to meet the adequacy and security requirements for our Customers that operate in the E.U. and other international transfers of Customer data. To receive a copy of our standard Data Processing Addendum, incorporating Model Clauses, please email [privacy@druva.com](mailto:privacy@druva.com).

### **Identifying the Data Controller and Data Processor**

Druva acts as a data controller when we collect and process Personal Data (as defined below) for Druva’s legitimate interests, such as analyzing user interaction with our Site to enable the use of our Site. 

Druva acts as a data processor when we provide our products and services to our Customers. When acting as a data processor, Druva will only process Personal Data (as defined below) in accordance with a Customer’s instructions and this Policy. Druva’s affiliates or subsidiaries may also act as data controllers or data processors to the extent Customers purchase the product and services from those entities or Personal Data is shared with those entities. 

 **Back to Top** __

### **Information We Collect and Receive**

Druva may collect and receive Customer data and other information in various ways when you use our Site and services. We collect two types of information: Personal Data and Aggregate Data. 

As used in this Policy, “Personal Data” means information that directly or indirectly identifies an individual, such as a name, email address, identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that individual. “Personal Data” excludes Aggregate Data. As used in this Policy, “Aggregate Data” is information we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. Aggregate Data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs, so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our services. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of Aggregate Data. We may share Aggregate Data about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our Customers’ needs, improve our services, and for advertising and marketing purposes. We collect information you give us on our Site and when you register for and use our services. Examples include the following:

  *  **Registration and Profile Information**.  When you register to use our services or update your profile, we may collect various kinds of information about you, including your name, email address, title, company and other profile information you provide, demographic information, and information you upload like photos, files, and documents.  

  *  **Contact Information**. We collect the email addresses you provide for contacts you enter or upload into your private contacts page. When you choose to collaborate or share files with others, we also collect email addresses you provide to email invitations to those individuals on your behalf.  When you provide us with personal information about your contacts we will only use this information for the specific reason for which it is provided.    

  *  **Payment Information**. If you choose to use a paid Druva account or service, our payment processing vendor collects your credit card information and billing address.  

  *  **Submissions and Customer Service**. From time to time, we may use surveys, contests, or sweepstakes requesting personal or demographic information and Customer feedback. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and thus, you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  

  *  **Automatically Collected Information**. We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Site, services, and communications. For example, it is standard for your web browser to automatically send information to every site you visit, including ours. That information includes your computer’s IP address, access times, your browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), and referring site addresses. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and files and pages accessed or used by you. We do not link this automatically-collected information to personal information.  

  *  **When You Download and Use Our Services**. We automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or “UDID”). We also access the device file storage for photos and contacts. You can opt out of this at the device level.  

  *  **Mobile Tracking and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**. We do not ask for, access, or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time, unless the DLP add-on is activated when using our mobile applications or services. A user must explicitly turn on the location information feature but may or may not be able to disable this feature depending on your employer’s policy.  

  *  **Mobile Analytics**.  We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information, such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.  

  *  **Tracking Technologies**. We and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers may also use certain kinds of technology such as cookies, web beacons, scripts, and tags to collect information, analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies from these companies on an individual or aggregated basis.  

  *  **Cookies and Web Beacons**. Among other things, the use of cookies and web beacons enables us to improve our Site and emails by seeing which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing our Site, to personalize and improve your experience, to record your preferences, and to allow you to visit our Site without re-entering your member ID and/or password. A cookie is a small amount of data, which is sent to your browser from a Site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify your browser setting by editing your browser options to reject our cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and services may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and access certain web page features or services. A web beacon is an electronic image, also called a “gif,” that may be used on our web pages to deliver cookies, count visits, compile statistics on usage, and campaign effectiveness in our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. None of these cookies and web beacons is tied up to your personal information.  

  *  **Local Storage (HTML5)**. We and our third-party partners use Local Storage (HTML5) to provide certain features on our Site, display advertising based on your web browsing activities, or store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.  

  *  **Advertising**. We partner with a third party to display advertising on our Site or manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partner may use technologies, such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Site and other sites to provide you advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). If you are located in the E.U., click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads; you will continue to receive generic ads.

### **Google Analytics**

We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, to better understand your use of our Site and services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to visiting. Google uses the data to track and examine the use of the Site, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the Site to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). Google offers an opt-out mechanism for the web available [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

### **How We Share and Disclose Information**

This section describes how Druva may share and disclose Information. Customers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of Information, and Druva does not control how they or any other third parties choose to share or disclose Information.

  *  **Aggregate or De-identified Data.** Druva reserves the right to share aggregated demographic information about our Customers, sales, and traffic to our partners and advertisers.   We will not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any of your personal information or any data that you store using our services to any third party, except as outlined in this Policy or with your consent.   

  * **Compliance with Laws.** We may disclose information to a third party as required by law when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary (a) to protect us, our agents, our Customers, and others, (b) to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms of use, (c) to respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities, (d) to respond to an emergency or protect the personal safety of any person, (e) to investigate and help prevent security threats, fraud, or other malicious activity, or (f) to comply with a regulation, subpoena, court order, or similar legal process.  

  *  **Service Providers.** We may engage with service providers to perform business functions and provide services to us in the U.S. and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as processing your payment or offering live Customer support chat. Druva may share your Personal Data with these service providers on the condition that they use your Personal Data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions and are subject to obligations consistent with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.   

  * **Corporate Affiliates.** Druva may share other information with its corporate affiliates, parent(s), or subsidiaries.   

  * **Change in Druva’s Business.** We may also share personal information in connection with an acquisition, merger, or sale of all or a substantial portion of our business, with or to another company. In any such event, you will receive notice if your data is transferred and becomes subject to a substantially different privacy policy.  




If you are an individual Druva registered user, and the domain of the primary email address associated with your Druva account is owned by your employer and that email address was assigned to you as an employee of that organization, and that organization wishes to establish a Druva corporate account and add you to it, then certain information concerning past use of your individual account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator, including your email address. Druva includes collaboration features that, by their nature, support sharing with users you choose. Those users can see your name, email address, photo and information from your profile page, and any files you choose to share. Further, they can post comments and email you. Collaborators you invite as editors can also edit your shared files, upload documents and photos to your shared files, share those documents outside of Druva, and give other users the rights to view your shared files.
