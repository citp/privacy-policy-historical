# Privacy Policy - Druva, Inc.

Your privacy is important to Druva1. This privacy policy (“Policy”) applies to the Druva Site, [www.druva.com](http://www.druva.com/) and services owned and operated by Druva. This Policy tells you how personal information is collected, used, disclosed, and protected by Druva. If you use the Druva site and services as part of an entity or organization that has a corporate account with Druva (like your employer or a university), the individual terms of that organization’s contract for the corporate account may restrict our collection or use of your personal information more than what is described in this Policy. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged Druva. This Policy includes Druva’s Site Privacy Statements.

If you have questions or complaints regarding the Druva inSync Client application, please contact us at Druva Inc. 150 Mathilda Place, Suite 450, Sunnyvale, CA 94086, or by email at [privacy@druva.com](mailto:privacy@druva.com) or by phone at +1 888-248-4976. 

If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at [privacy@druva.com](mailto:privacy@druva.com).

Druva participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Druva is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. <https://www.privacyshield.gov/list>

Druva is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Druva complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Druva is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Druva may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.

We may change this Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the “last updated” date above. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email, sent to the e-mail address specified in your account, or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to check this Policy whenever you use our Site and services to understand how your personal information is used.

We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Site and services. We may also supplement this information with information such as “title” or “industry” from other companies to ensure a complete user profile is created. We collect two general types of information, namely, personal information and aggregate data. As used in this Policy, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name and email address), and demographic and other information when directly linked to information that can identify an individual. Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate” data. Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, no personal information is included in aggregate data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our services. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate data, and we may share aggregate data about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customer needs, improve our services, and for advertising and marketing purposes. We collect information you give us on our Site and when you register for and use our services. Examples include the following:

  * _Registration and profile information_ — when you register to use our services or update your profile, we may collect various kinds of information about you, including your name and email address; your title, company and other profile information you provide; demographic information; and information you upload like photos, files, and documents.
  * _Contact information_ — we collect the email addresses you provide for contacts you enter or upload into your private contacts page. When you choose to collaborate or share files with others, we also collect email addresses you provide to email invitations to those individuals on your behalf.
  * _Payment information_ — if you choose to use a paid Druva account or service, our payment processing vendor collects your credit card information and billing address.
  * _Submissions and customer service_ — from time to time we may use surveys, contests, or sweepstakes requesting personal or demographic information and customer feedback. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
  * _Automatically collected information_ — we automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Web pages, services, and communications. For example, it is standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every Site you visit, including ours. That information includes your computer’s IP address, access times, your browser type and language, and referring Site addresses. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and files and pages accessed or used by you. We do not link this automatically-collected information to personal information.
  * _When you download and use our services_ — we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or “UDID”). We also access the device file storage for photos and contacts. You can opt out of this at the device level.
  * We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time, unless the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) add-on is activated when using our Mobile Apps or Services. A user must explicitly turn on the location information feature but may or may not be able to disable this feature depending on their organization policy.
  * _Mobile Analytics_ – We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.
  * _Tracking technologies_ — we and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, may also use certain kinds of technology such as cookies, Web beacons, scripts, and tags to collect information, analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies from these companies on an individual or aggregated basis.
  * Among other things, the use of cookies and Web beacons enables us to improve our Site and emails by seeing which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing our Site, to personalize and improve your experience, to record your preferences, and to allow you to visit our Site without re-entering your member ID and/or password. A cookie is a small amount of data, which is sent to your browser from a Site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify your browser setting by editing your browser options to reject our cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and services may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and access certain Web page features or services. A Web beacon is an electronic image, also called a “gif,” that may be used on our Web pages to deliver cookies, count visits, compile statistics on usage, and campaign effectiveness in our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. None of these cookies and web beacons is tied up to your personal information.
  * _Local Storage (HTML5)_ – We and our third party partners use Local Storage (HTML5) to provide certain features on our Site, to display advertising based on your Web browsing activities, and/or to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.
  * We partner with a third party to display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Site and other sites to provide you advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). If you are located in the European Union, click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads; you will continue to receive generic ads.

### Sharing of Personal Information

Druva reserves the right to share aggregated demographic information about our customers, sales, and traffic to our partners and advertisers. We will not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any of your personal information or any data that you store using our services to any third party except as outlined in this Policy or with your consent. We may disclose information to a third party as required by law when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to (a) protect Druva, agents, customers, and others, such as to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms of use, or (b) in the good faith belief that disclosure is needed to respond to an emergency, or protect the personal safety of any person (c) as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, (d) to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as processing your payment or offering live customer support chat. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We may also share personal information in connection with an acquisition, merger, or sale of all or a substantial portion of our business, with or to another company. In any such event, you will receive notice if your data is transferred and becomes subject to a substantially different privacy policy.

If you are an individual Druva registered user, and the domain of the primary email address associated with your Druva account is owned by your employer and that email address was assigned to you as an employee of that organization, and that organization wishes to establish a Druva corporate account and add you to it, then certain information concerning past use of your individual account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator including your email address. Druva includes collaboration features that by their nature support sharing with users you choose. Those users can see your name, email address, photo and information from your Profile page, and any files you choose to share; and they can post comments and email you. Collaborators you invite as editors can also edit your shared files, upload documents and photos to your shared files, share those documents outside of Druva, and give other users rights to view your shared files.

### Network and Information Security

Druva takes reasonable steps to protect information we collect from you and our platform to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. In addition, highly confidential personal information, such as passwords that we request from you on our Site and the platform, is protected with encryption, such as Secured Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, during transmission over the Internet. The servers on which information is stored are kept in a controlled environment with limited access. While we take reasonable efforts to guard personal information we knowingly collect directly from you, no security system is impenetrable. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any passively-collected personal information you choose to include in documents you store on our systems are maintained at adequate levels of protection to meet specific needs or obligations you may have relating to that information. For some customers, your account information and access to our service is accessible only through the use of an individual user ID and password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. In addition, always log out and close your browser when you finish your session. Please note that we will never ask you to disclose your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.

Upon request Druva will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by emailing [privacy@druva.com](mailto:privacy@druva.com). We will respond to your request within 30 days.

Druva acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. Druva has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to Druva’s Client (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. 

We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to perform administrator initiated backups and restores and device decommissioning.
