However, we may collect and store certain information automatically. This information will not be shared with anyone beyond the web site support staff, except when required by law enforcement investigation (such as to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or subpoena), and will be used only as a source of anonymous statistical information.

We may use the summary statistics to help us make our site more useful to visitors, such as assessing what information is of most and least interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining the site’s technical design specifications and identifying system performance or problem areas. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and to provide you with enhanced services (viewing history, account information). A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. If you reject cookies, you can still use our site, but your ability to use or access some areas of our site may be limited.

Drugs.com does not give, sell, or transfer any personal information to any third party for their promotional purposes. 

However, Your e-mail message, question, or comment may be forwarded to other Drugs.com employees, contractors or subcontractors, who may be better able to help You. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not share our e-mail with any other outside organizations. However, e-mail and on-line forms are not secure against interception and senders cannot expect guaranteed privacy. 

### Security

Drugs.com follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
