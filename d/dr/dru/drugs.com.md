This web site contains links to other web sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other web sites.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our web site and to read the privacy policies of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this web site.

### Cookies

A browser cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this web site. We do not link the information stored in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our web site. We use cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our web site, to provide you with enhanced services (viewing history and account information). If you reject cookies, you can still use our web site, but your ability to use or access some areas of our web site may be limited.

#### Advertising

Some third party advertising partners may also use browser cookies. For advertising information and opt-out options please [click here](https://web.archive.org/support/privacy/advertising.html).

Some third party advertising partners may also use local shared objects (also known as LSOs or Flash cookies) to collect and store information.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118).

We employ third party services (such as Google Analytics) that help us better manage content on our web site by informing us what content is effective and which may also utilize browser cookies. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

Some third party partners (such as ComScore) employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs). Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to any personally identifiable information.

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

You may choose to provide us with personal information, by sending email with questions or comments or by filling out an online form and submitting it to us through our web site. We use this information to;

  * Gather the requested information
  * Respond to Your message
  * Follow-up as appropriate



Drugs.com does not create individual profiles with the information you provide. If information is collected, it will be used solely in connection with Drugs.com, or for such other purposes as are described at the point of collection. Drugs.com does not give, sell, or transfer any personal information to any third party for their promotional purposes unless you allow it.

Your email message, question, or comment may be forwarded to authorized Drugs.com employees, contractors or subcontractors, who may be better able to help you. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not share email with any other outside organizations. However, email and online forms are not secure against interception and senders cannot expect guaranteed privacy.

During registration you are required to provide contact information such as your name, age, email address, preferred username, password and preferred subscriptions. We will only use this information to contact you about the services on our web site in which you have expressed interest.

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update, delete, or deactivate your information by signing into your account or by emailing our [Customer Support](http://www.drugs.com/support/contact.html) or by contacting us by telephone or via courier at the contact information listed above.

### Medication Lists

To store a medication list, you will need to create a Drugs.com account. You control who can access or edit the information stored in your medication list. It will not be accessible to anyone else except for authorized web site support staff or when required by law enforcement investigation (such as to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or subpoena), and will be used only as a source of anonymous statistical information. Drugs.com may use non-personally identifiable aggregate data to publish drug usage statistics, drug interaction data and drug treatment combinations. No data from a medication list will be sold to any other party.

If you choose to participate in any community oriented parts of the Drugs.com web site, such as a forum, bulletin board, blog, chatroom, Q&A, reviews or comments section, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to submit can be read, collected, used by others and may appear in search engines. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit. Drugs.com also reserves the right to terminate the accounts of visitors who use these services in a manner inconsistent with our Terms of Use.

### Social Media

Our Web site includes social media features, such as the Facebook like button (and widgets, such as a share button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site). These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our web site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our web site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

### Opting Out

We provide you the opportunity to ’opt-out’ of having personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you set up an account but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference during signup.

Deleting your account will also remove any personally identifiable information connected with this account. 

## Refer a Friend

## Email Disclosure

If you subscribe to receive email, we will only send messages to notify you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. These emails may contain an occasional sponsor message. Email messages sent to you will always contain at least one clearly visible link to unsubscribe.

## Security

Drugs.com follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect all personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to protect your sensitive information (if any) on our site. If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can send an [email](http://www.drugs.com/support/contact.html) using our contact form.

## Data Retention

Web site access data is generally deleted within 90 days (such as IP addresses). For practical reasons, some personally identifiable information is retained until you choose to delete such information (where possible), or you choose to close your account, or your account is terminated.

## Legal Disclosure

Drugs.com reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy policy, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage prior to the change becoming effective.
