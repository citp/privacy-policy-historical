This site is produced by Lebhar-Friedman, Inc. This policy applies to all sites
produced by Lebhar-Friedman, Inc. This policy does not cover information
collected on sites linked to/from Lebhar-Friedman, Inc. sites.<br>
<br>
Lebhar-Friedman, Inc. sites are committed to bringing you information tailored
to your individual needs and, at the same time, to protecting your privacy. The
following is a summary of the various ways we treat the information you provide
us while accessing our sites:<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">1. <i>What information does <b>Drug Store News</b> gather/track about you?</i> </p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt"><b>Drug Store News</b> only collects personally identifying information with your
specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you register for our
services, complete a survey or subscribe to our publications, you are asked to
provide information such as your e-mail address, name, or phone number.
Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested.<br>
<br>
<b>Drug Store News</b> uses this information to provide you with the service you have
requested. For example, if you subscribe to one of our magazines, we will use
your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address
to send you your publication. We may also use the information to communicate
with you about new features, products or services, or to improve the services
that we offer by tailoring them to your needs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><b>Drug Store News</b> also logs IP addresses
(the location of your computer on the Internet) for systems administration and
troubleshooting purposes. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally
identifiable. </p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">2. <i>What does <b>Drug Store News</b> do
internally with the information it gathers/tracks?</i> </p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><b>Drug Store News</b> may perform statistical
analyses of user behavior in order to measure relative user interest in the
various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform
advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their
advertising banners. In performance of these statistical analyses, we will
disclose information to third parties in aggregate form. </p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">Using the e-mail addresses
provided at registration, <b>Drug Store News</b> periodically sends promotional e-mail to
its registered users about services offered by <b>Drug Store News</b> and its advertisers. A
user can indicate on the registration form that he or she does not wish to
receive e-mail information from <b>Drug Store News</b> or its advertisers. </p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">3. <i>With whom does <b>Drug Store News</b>
share the information it gathers/tracks?</i> </p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt"><b>Drug Store News</b> does not sell any of our users' personal information. We may,
however, share information with carefully selected companies who we think can
offer services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your
information shared with these companies, write to us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@condenet.com">webmaster@lf.com</a>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">Although we will not sell your information, we cannot ensure, however,
that your personal information will not be disclosed to third parities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By way of example, without limiting the
foregoing, we may be forced to disclose information to the government under
certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access
transmissions or private communications, or might disclose your information to
other sites as part of offering additional functionality to you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, we can (and you authorize us
to) disclose your personal information to private entities, law enforcement or
other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or
appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, we do not
promise that your personal information will remain private.</span></p>

</span></i><!--[endif]--><i>Is Lebhar-Friedman, Inc. responsible for the content or
the privacy policies of Web sites to which it may link? <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

policy.</span><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">5. <i>What is a cookie?</i> </p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">A "cookie" is a small
piece of information that a Web site can store in a designated file on your
computer. It can be used, among other things, to identify you when you log in
to a Web site. When you visit a site, that site can access only the information
which it stored in your cookie -- not information put in your cookie by other
sites. </p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.5pt">Our cookies do not contain any information that is, in itself,
personally identifying.<br>
<br>
Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have
control over cookies placed by advertisers.<br>
<br>
If you don't want cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option that
allows you not to accept them. We don't recommend using this option, though; it
makes browsing our site a less enjoyable experience.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For instance, when you turn off your cookie
option, you may have to enter information every time you visit the site, or a
page may no longer be customized to your specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;text-indent:.5in">6. <i>Will I receive unsolicited
e-mail if I accept your cookies?</i> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:
13.5pt;margin-left:.5in">No. Acceptance of cookies on our Web site does not
result in your receiving any additional e-mail from us or from our advertisers.
As noted in the above answer 2, when you registered, you chose whether to
receive promotional e-mail from <b>Drug Store News</b> or from our advertisers.</p>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;text-indent:.5in">7. <i>How is my information kept
secure?</i> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:
13.5pt;margin-left:.5in">We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the
confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewalls, secure sockets
layer, and password protection, where appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>However, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet.</p>

Lebhar-Friedman, Inc. sites are not intended for use by children, especially
those under age 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal
information or use our public discussion areas, forums, or chatrooms. Minors
under the age of 18 are prohibited from making purchases, including
subscriptions, on our sites.<br>
<br>
If your children disclose information about themselves in our public discussion
areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you
should tell them not to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
