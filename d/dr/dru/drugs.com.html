However, we may collect and store certain information automatically. This information will not be shared with anyone beyond the web site support staff, except when required by law enforcement investigation (such as to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or subpoena), and will be used only as a source of anonymous statistical information. This information may include:</p>

<p>We may use the summary statistics to help us make our site more useful to visitors, such as assessing what information is of most and least interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining the site’s technical design specifications and identifying system performance or problem areas.</p>

<p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.</p>
<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and to provide you with enhanced services (viewing history, account information). A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. If you reject cookies, you can still use our site, but your ability to use or access some areas of our site may be limited.</p>

<p>The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies. </p>

<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>
<p>Our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Flash LSOs</h3>
<p>We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control or high game score, or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit.  Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.</p>

<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:</p>
