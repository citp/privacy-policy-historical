**_**TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED**_ The following are the types of information we may collect: **

****Information You Provide to Us**** We may ask you to provide us with information through the Web Site, including the following: 

  * Personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you as a specific person, such as your name, e-mail address, cell phone number, and physical address; 
  * Demographic information, such as gender, zip code, information regarding your education or number of children, or similar information; and
  * Other information about yourself, such as your interests or preferences.
  * You may also be asked to choose a user name and password in order to identify yourself during future visits to the Web Site. Do not use your real name or the name of any other actual person as your user name.



We may combine non-personal information with personal information, in which case we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. 

Providing us with information about yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Web Site’s features.

Note that we may de-identify personal information we have received, turning it into non-personal information. This is sometimes accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code. The code does not identify you directly, but it may be used to connect your activity and interests.

**Information We Collect Automatically on the Web Site**

We may collect information automatically when you visit the Web Site, including: ****

  * Information about your device, including device type and settings, and browser type and operating system;
  * Web sites or other services you visited before and after visiting the Web Site;
  * Areas of the Web Site with which you interact, advertisements you view, and links you click on within the Web Site;
  * Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is a number automatically assigned to your device whenever you access the Internet, or another unique identifier for the device you use to access the Web Site (e.g. Apple’s Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) or Google’s Android Advertising ID (AAID)). IP address can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area.
  * Information about your internet connection (e.g., mobile operator, ISP, WiFi connection). 
  * Information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies.
  * Information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded.



When analyzed, this usage information helps us determine how visitors arrive at the Web Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.

**Information from Other Sources** We may receive information about you from other sources. For example, we may obtain geographic or demographic information, or information regarding your possible interests, from third parties, or we may receive information from a marketing partner in connection with a co-branded web site or promotion. We may use this information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you and to tailor content and ads we serve to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personal information

**Send to a Friend** If you send a friend a communication from the Web Site, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc.) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain additional consent from that person.

However, as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may share certain non-personal information such as device identifiers, usage information and other de-identified information, including sharing with our third-party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for advertising and analytics purposes.
