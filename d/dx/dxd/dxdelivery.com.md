2.4 In addition, when you visit our websites, use our apps, or interact with DX-related tools or plug-ins, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, unique device identifier,  browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken, and dates and times of activity.   A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A "web beacon" also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages or apps to web servers and may be used to transmit information back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we examine and identify usage patterns.  We may link certain data elements we have collected through automated means, such as your browser information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you. We also may use third-party analytics tools that collect information about visitor traffic on our websites or apps. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our websites or apps.  Both we and others (such as our internal marketing division) may collect personal information about our visitors' online activities, over time and across third-party websites, when using our websites and apps.  

_Usage data_

2.5 We may process data about your use of the Site (" **usage data** "). This may include your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, operating system, referral source, length of visit, page views and website navigation paths, as well as information about the timing, frequency and pattern of your use. This data is obtained through our analytics tracking system. Often usage data will be aggregated in such a way that it contains no information pertaining to an individual at all: as such is it not actually personal data but we address it in this Privacy Notice for completeness’ sake. We process usage data for the purpose of improving our Site. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely the improvement of our Site.

_Correspondence data_

2.6 We may process personal data contained in or relating to any communication that you send to us, whether through the Site, by email, through social media, by using live-chat functions, or as feedback on our services which you provide based on our customer satisfaction surveys, including through third parties like TrustPilot who we engage to solicit feedback on our behalf. All of this together is  **correspondence data**. This may include the communication content and metadata associated with the communication, as well as any contact details you provide to us such as your name, email address, phone number, job title, address or social media username. The correspondence data may be processed for the purposes of communicating with you and record-keeping. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely the proper administration of the Site, our business and our communications.

_Enquiry data_

2.7 We may process personal data contained in any enquiry you submit to us indicating your interest in our services or business ( **enquiry data** ), such as the contents of your enquiry and any contact details you provide to us such as your name, email address, phone number, job title or address. This may be processed for the purposes of marketing relevant services to you. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely ensuring that enquiries are followed up appropriately and marketing our services.

_Delivery data_

2.8 We may process personal data which we have obtained from you in connection with deliveries of mail, parcels or consignments which are either 0addressed to you or for which you have provided a signature. That data could include your name and signature. We may also process personal data which is generated by our drivers when delivering mail or parcels to you for the purposes of confirming delivery. That could include geo-location data (showing that our driver was in your locality) or photographs of the delivery location. All of this information together is  **delivery data**. This may be processed by us for the purposes of recording and evidencing delivery of mail and parcels carried by us. The legal basis for this processing depends on whether the delivery data relates to the addressee for the mail, parcel or consignment or whether it relates to another individual who is not the addressee but who signed for the delivery. In relation to the addressee, the legal basis for our processing is the performance of a contract benefiting the addressee. In relation to other individuals, the basis for our processing is our legitimate interests, namely ensuring that we are able to demonstrate that we have performed our delivery obligations.

_Telephone recordings_

2.9 We may record calls made to us. These recordings may be processed by us for the purposes of record-keeping and administering the activity to which the call relates (for example, complaint handling or enquiry handling) and for training purposes. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest, namely ensuring that we are able to properly track, manage and respond to telephone communications.

#### Personal data we obtain from others

_Service data_

2.10 We may process personal data relating to personnel at organisations to whom we provide services, or from whom we purchase services  **service data** ). For example, we may process information relating to key account contacts at our suppliers and customers, with whom we deal regularly in the course of our business. Service data may be processed by us in connection with the supply, receipt and administration of the relevant services. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely ensuring that we are able to supply, receive and administer relevant services in the course of our business.

_Addressee data_

2.11 We may process personal data relating to individuals to whom mail, parcels or consignments carried by us are to be delivered ( **addressee data** ), such as the name, address and contact details of those individuals. Addressee data is provided to us by our business customers: for example, if we provide carriage services to a retailer of furniture, then that retailer will necessarily have to provide us with personal data relating to the addressee in order for us to deliver the furniture ordered. Addressee data may be processed by us in connection with the carriage and delivery of the relevant mail, parcels or consignments, and in connection with associated administration and correspondence, both with the relevant business customer and with the addressee. The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract benefiting the addressee: for example, if you have ordered a package from a retailer then you have a contract with that retailer, and our delivery services help that retailer perform its obligations to you. We may also use addressee data to contact addressees shortly after delivery to solicit feedback on the provision of our services. The legal basis for that processing is our legitimate interests, namely ensuring the quality of our services.

#### CCTV data

2.12 We have installed CCTV systems in some of our premises, and on some of our vehicles. We may process stills or footage which contains images of individuals ( **CCTV data** ). CCTV data may be processed by us for the purposes of monitoring building and vehicle security and crime prevention and detection. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely ensuring the safety and security of our staff, premises and property.

### 11\. Your rights

11.1 In this section we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. You can read guidance from the Information Commissioner’s Office at [www.ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk/) for a fuller explanation of your rights.

11.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are:

11.2.1  **the right to access:**  you have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, to access to the personal data, together with additional information including details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee;

11.2.2  **the right to rectification:**  you have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed;

11.2.3  **the right to erasure:**  in some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data. These might include if the personal data are no longer needed for the purposes for which they were processed or if the processing is for direct marketing purposes. However, there are some exclusions of the right to erasure, such as where processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or in connection with legal claims;

11.2.4  **the right to restrict processing:**  in some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Where processing has been restricted, we may continue to store your personal data and will observe the restrictions on processing except in the case of processing permitted by applicable law (for example, in connection with legal claims or for reasons of public interest);

11.2.5  **the right to object to processing:**  you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on the basis of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will stop processing the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or unless the processing is for legal claims. You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes and if you do so we will stop processing your personal data for that purpose;

11.2.6  **the right to data portability:**  if the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is consent, or the performance of a contract with you, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others; and

11.2.7  **the right to complain to a supervisory authority:**  if you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.

11.3 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written  notice to us. As mentioned, though, we recommend that when you are requesting access to personal data you use our standard Data Subject Access Request form which can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/media/338242/dx-group-plc-subject-access-request-form.doc).
