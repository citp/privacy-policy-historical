# Deutsche Post DHL Group | Data protection

   
**As of July 13, 2016**  
Deutsche Post AG (hereinafter called 'Deutsche Post DHL Group') is pleased that you have visited our website and are interested in our company, products and services. It is important to us to protect your personal data during handling throughout the entire business process. We want you to feel secure when you visit our Internet pages.

In the following, we explain what information Deutsche Post DHL Group collects when you visit our website and how this information is used.

### Personal data

Personal data is specific information about personal or factual characteristics relating to a certain natural person or a natural person who can be specified. This includes information such as your real name, address, telephone number and date of birth. Information that cannot be directly linked to your real identity - such as favorite websites or number of users of a site - is not considered personal data.

### Collection and processing of personal data

Deutsche Post DHL Group is committed to preserving the privacy of users of our website. When you visit our web pages, our web servers always temporarily save for security purposes the connection data of the computer connecting to our site, a list of the web pages that you visit within our site, the date and duration of your visit, the identification data of the type of browser and operation system used as well as the website through which you linked to our site. Additional personal information such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address is not collected unless you provide this data voluntarily, e.g. while completing an online contact form, as part of a registration, survey, competition, fulfillment of contract or an information request.

### Utilization and passing on of personal data

We use the personal data which you have made available to us exclusively for technical administration of the web pages and to fulfill your wishes and requests - thus primarily for fulfillment of a contract concluded with you or to answer your request.

Only when you have previously granted your approval or - if so stipulated by legal regulations - have not raised an objection do we also use this data for product-related surveys and marketing purposes.

Deutsche Post DHL Group does not share, sell, transfer or otherwise disseminate your personal data to third parties and will not do so in future, unless required by law, unless required for the purpose of the contract or unless you have given express consent to do so. For instance, it may be necessary to pass on your address and order data to our contractors when you order products.

### Information from the Group

The Deutsche Post DHL Group companies would like to contact you in order to provide you with the latest information about updates to our website or our offers, news, products and services. If you contact or register on our web pages, we sometimes request that you indicate whether or not you would like to receive direct advertising material from us. If you are already a customer of Deutsche Post DHL Group, you will naturally continue to receive necessary information about important changes in connection with existing contracts (e.g. rate changes).

### Use of web tracking

We use tracking software to determine how many users visit our website and how often. We do not use this software to collect individual personal data or individual IP addresses. The data are used solely in anonymous and summarized form for statistical purposes and for developing the website. It helps us improve the services we offer to you, and to make our website's content and services easier to use and more appropriate to you.

### Use of cookies

"Cookies" are small files that enable us to store information related to your PC and you, the user, specifically, while you visit one of our websites. Cookies help us to determine how frequently our internet pages are accessed as well as the number of users. And they help us configure our offers so that they are as convenient and efficient as possible for you.

On the one hand, we use what are called "session cookies", those that are stored exclusively for the duration of your visit to one of our internet pages. On the other, we use "persistent cookies" for retaining information about visitors who repeatedly access one of our internet pages. The purpose of using cookies is to be able to offer you optimal user guidance as well as to "recognize" you and thus be able to present (as much as possible) diversified internet pages and new contents during repeated use.   
**The content of a persistent cookie is limited to an identification number. Name, IP address, etc., are not saved. We do not create an individual profile of your online activities.**

### Cookie categories

Cookies can be categorized into 4 groups as follows: ****

  1. **Strictly Necessary:** These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided. ****
  2. **Performance:** These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works. ****
  3. **Functionality:** These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features. For example, these cookies can be used to remember changes to text size, fonts and language. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. ****
  4. **Targeting or Advertising:** These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests They are also used to limitthe number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator's permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. The Deutsche Post DHL Group website does not currently use any targeting cookies.

If you decide to share content, cookies may be set by the service you have chosen to share content through. Deutsche Post DHL Group does not control the use of these cookies and you should therefore check the relevant third party's website for more information.

### Third party cookies in embedded content

Please note that on some pages of our websites you may notice that cookies have been set that are not related to Deutsche Post DHL Group. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Vimeo, these service providers may set their own cookies on your web browser. Deutsche Post DHL Group does not control the use of these cookies and cannot access them due to the way that cookies work, as cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them. You should check the third party websites for more information about these cookies.

### How to manage cookies

Using our products and services without cookies is also possible. In your browser, you can deactivate the saving of cookies, limit them to particular websites, or set the browser to notify you when a cookie is sent. You can also delete cookies from your PC hard drive at any time (file: "cookies"). Please note that in this case you will have to expect a limited page presentation and limited user guidance. For example, our live streaming and webcasts may stop functioning correctly.

### Security

Deutsche Post DHL Group takes all of the necessary technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data from being lost or misused. For instance, your data is saved in a secure operating environment which is not accessible to the public. In certain cases, your personal data is encrypted by Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL) during transmission. This means that an approved encryption procedure is used for communication between your computer and the Deutsche Post DHL Group servers if your browser supports SSL.

Should you wish to contact Deutsche Post DHL Group by e-mail, we would like to point out that the confidentiality of the information sent cannot be guaranteed. The contents of e-mail messages can be read by third parties. We therefore recommend you send us confidential information only by post.

Upon written request, we will inform you what personal data (e.g. name, address) we have saved on you.

### DPDHL Data Privacy Policy
