By using the Site, you (hereinafter, “you” or “user”) consent to our practices described herein. 

> **By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to us via this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of dLife and the authorized third parties referred to herein for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.**

 **REVISIONS AND UPDATES.  
** Our commitment to being a leading source of information regarding diabetes means that our business will continue to evolve as we introduce new services and features to the Site. Because of this, from time to time, our policies will be reviewed and may be revised. As such, dLife reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Should we modify this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting an updated version of the Privacy Policy on the Site. It is your responsibility to periodically check this page so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we might disclose it. The amended Privacy Policy will apply between us whether or not we have given you specific notice of any change. 

**COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA.  
** We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily choose to provide such information such as when you enter your Personal Data on our Site. Wherever we collect Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.  So that we can provide you with content targeted to your needs and efficient online service, dLife may request information about you.

We also may collect technical data such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring Web site address. This information is collected both during member registration on the Site, when opting in to receive a newsletter, when opting in to receive special offers from dLife and/or dLife partners, when entering a dLife sweepstakes or contest, or when answering a survey. Personal Data collected via the Site will be available within the network of web sites operated by LifeMed Media , Inc. for use in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

From time-to-time we may give you the opportunity to opt-in to offers from unaffiliated third parties that we deem to be of potential value to you. You may also choose to opt-in to these offers on an ongoing basis when you sign up for dLife membership, and you may opt out of receiving them at any time. If you decide to opt-in to participate in these offers, we will provide your Personal Data to the third party. However, you should note that the third parties will not be bound by this Privacy Policy. Any Personal Data that you give and/or authorize us to give to another party will be governed by the rules of that party's privacy policy, which may differ from this Privacy Policy. dLife is not responsible for Personal Data given to other parties. Please review their privacy policies prior to providing any Personal Data to third parties and/or opting-in to permit us to disclose your Personal Data to third parties. 

**WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL DATA.**  
We may use Personal Data in order to display custom, personalized content to our visitors.

We may use your Personal Data to extend you offers about third party products and/or services that may be of interest to you. However, except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy,  we will not disclose your Personal Data to such parties without your prior consent. 

We may occasionally generate reports for advertisers containing aggregate information about our users such as demographics and online usage trends. This allows us to provide content and advertiser offers that are most relevant and beneficial to our users. Except as otherwise disclosed herein, we will not include any Personal Data in these reports.

dLife allows users of our Site to send articles by email to other parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any email addresses (unless you are a member who already has voluntarily provided your email address) of either the sender or recipient of such articles after they are sent.

**COOKIES.**  
Cookies are small text files that a web server may ask your web browser to store and to send back to the web server when needed. They allow you to take full advantage of the Site dLife website, and, as such, we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

Cookies may be used to store a transaction identifier or other information a user may provide. We use cookies in the following ways:

 _Complex transactions:_ Cookies are used to store and retrieve unique transaction identifiers or other server-generated or user-provided information in complex, multi-page web applications. This allows us to distinguish between different users, and to use information provided at one stage of an application at a later time (for instance, items placed in a 'shopping cart' might need to be displayed on a later 'check-out' screen). When we use cookies in this way, the cookie is stored on your web browser only temporarily; the cookie is destroyed at the end of the transaction or at the end of the browser session.

 _Customized Services:_ Cookies may also be used to automatically identify a particular user to the system, in order to provide a customized service, such as a personalized web page. In this case, a cookie containing a unique user identifier will be permanently stored on your web browser. We do not store sensitive information in such cookies; only a unique user identifier or generic preference values are stored. Personal information you give us for processing a transaction or using one of our personalization features, may be stored on our secure web server. Personal information that you give us for processing a transaction or using one of our personalization features, may be stored on our secure web server, retained only as long as necessary and properly disposed of. dLife does not use cookies to keep a database of Personal Data about visitors, unless you choose to provide such information to us. 

**VISITORS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.**  
The Site and the servers upon which this Site is hosted are located in the United States. All matters and material related to the Site is governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut in the United States. Any information users outside of the U.S. provide will be transferred to the United States, and by visiting this Site and submitting Personal Data and other information, you authorize this transfer.

 **CHILDREN AND PRIVACY.**  
dLife complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. The Site is directed at an adult market and is intended for use by adults only. We do not collect Personal Data from anyone under 13, nor do we allow children under 13 to participate in forums or chat rooms without prior verified parental consent. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide Personal Data on this Site without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to dLife through this Site, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

 **STORAGE AND SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA.**  
We take reasonable steps to protect the security of your Personal Data. Since no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure, we do not promise that the Personal Data you provide to us will always be totally secure. Therefore, you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via the Internet.
