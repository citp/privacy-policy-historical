This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on the Dearfoams.com website from residents of the United States. If you are visiting the Dearfoams.com website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States.

**Security**  
Dearfoams.com has imposed confidentiality obligations on its service providers who will have access to the personal information collected on this site. In addition, we have implemented administrative, technical and physical measures to address the confidentiality of personal information collected on this website. We use secure-socket-layer (SSL) certificate authentication to protect order information during transmission by encrypting all sensitive information transmitted during your shopping experience. SSL is encryption technology that provides security for information that's transmitted over the Internet. This site accepts orders only from web browsers that permit communication through SSL technology. We also reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.

While we implement the above security measures for this website, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.

If you transact business with us, such personally identifiable information may also include financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information).
