It governs your participation on the eBayCommerceNetwork.com, Shopping.com and DealTime.com websites (including the versions of these sites in foreign jurisdictions), their sister sites, and all co-branded versions of these sites or any successor brand that eBay may designate from time to time in its discretion (in the United States or foreign jurisdictions), which are referred to collectively as the "eBay Commerce Network" or "ECN," along with their related sites, applications, services, and tools, regardless of how you access or use them, including through mobile devices. </p>

                            <p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. Any such amendment shall take effect when such amendment is sent by email or posted on the eBay Commerce Network. Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person. </p>
