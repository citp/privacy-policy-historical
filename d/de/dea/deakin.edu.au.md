The Information Privacy Act requires public sector agencies to inform individuals when their personal information is being collected, and to identify how the agency will use that information. 

### What is personal information

### Cookies

A cookie is a small, text file that is stored by a browser on a computer's hard drive. It has a limited lifetime – usually until the browser is shut down. This allows web servers to remember the user on subsequent visits without having to prompt them for the same information. This function may be disabled in the web browser if the user does not wish to accept cookies, but this may effect their access to all parts of the Deakin University website. 

Cookies are used to store both personal and non-personal information. Examples of personal information are encrypted username and encrypted password that are used by Deakin University Portal and Deakin University Webmail. Examples of non-personal information include the Deakin web server that the user has authenticated into, the top level domain name of the user’s Internet Service Provider, the date and the time of a visit to the site, the pages accessed and downloaded, the address of the last site visited, and the type of browser being used. 

Cookies make it possible to identify registered users without needing to ask for registration details every time the user accesses a site. Using cookies makes accessing sites more convenient to the user as they don't need to remember their username and password each time they enter the site. 

Deakin University may also use cookies to track users as they travel through the site - for instance, it might use cookies to count the total number of unique users who are accessing the site over a particular period of time, or to ensure that users don't see a particular advert more than once. This information is purely used for our internal purposes. The use of cookies in this way helps to make systems more efficient. Deakin University also uses this information for monitoring its web site use, and to facilitate web site management, development and planning.  


### On-Line Forms

The University web site may offer users the opportunity to supply personal information to enable it to provide you with further services, including allowing users to access restricted areas of the website, responding to users’ questions by e-mail or the provision of information to users via email.

Users may in the future be able to complete enrolment and registration forms or access grades on-line. 

### How does Deakin University use personal information about visitors to its website?
