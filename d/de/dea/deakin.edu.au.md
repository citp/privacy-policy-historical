We use and disclose personal information to perform our core functions of teaching, research, and service to the community, and to help us provide the services that support these functions. We may also engage contractors to provide these services, in which case personal information will be disclosed to them only to the extent required to provide each specific service.

Your privacy is important to us so each time you communicate with Deakin, you'll receive a collection statement that explains how personal information for that interaction will be managed.

## Deakin campus visitors

 When you visit our campuses, your personal information is collected in the following ways:

### Surveillance cameras

Deakin has installed surveillance cameras across its campuses to:

  * enhance the safety of staff, students and visitors to the university

  * enable monitoring and analysis of room usage and demand for space.



Surveillance camera recordings are used to enable investigations of incidents on campus and for business purposes such as planning and analysis.

Depending on the settings on your smartphone, the name of your phone may constitute personal information. Location-based services are provided to make campus visitors aware of special offers and events and to provide emergency and safety warnings.

Location-based data is also collected to monitor and analyse traffic patterns, space usage and allocation. Such information is managed in accordance with the _Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014_ and the _Health Records Act 2001_.

## Access to information by third parties

Deakin does not provide personal information about its staff and students to third parties unless we're satisfied that:

  * the disclosure is authorised under relevant privacy legislation
  * the associated staff member or student has given their consent
  * it is required by law to disclose information.



If privacy legislation authorises Deakin to disclose information, we will assess the request on a case-by-case basis and will use our discretion to determine whether to disclose information. Deakin is not legally obligated to disclose personal information when authorised to do so.

Guidance on frequently encountered requests for disclosure of personal information is below.

### Parents of students

Deakin frequently receives requests from parents to confirm that their child is attending classes or making good academic progress. We're unable to provide personal information about students to their parents unless the student has given their explicit consent. This is regardless of whether the student in question is under 18 or if the parent is paying their fees and/or expenses.

A student can give their consent by:

  * notifying Deakin of the name of the person to whom we’re authorised to disclose information
  * explaining the type of information that can be disclosed
  * providing the period of time during which the consent remains in effect.



Deakin's Division of Student Administration (DSA) has a form available for this purpose, which should be completed and returned to DSA for their records.

Deakin must be satisfied that the consent is valid, that the request falls within the scope of the consent, and that the identity of the student and the recipient of the information has been confirmed.

### Law enforcement agencies

Information Privacy Principle 2.2(g) of the _Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014_  and Health Privacy Principle 2.2(j) of the _Health Records Act 2001_ set out the circumstances in which Deakin is authorised to disclose personal information to law enforcement agencies.

Requests from law enforcement agencies must:

  * be in writing on the agency's letterhead (if sent in hard copy)
  * contain the agency’s name, address, contact details and be sent from an email address clearly linked to the agency (if sent by email)
  * specify what information is required and why it’s needed so that Deakin can be reasonably satisfied that the information is reasonably required by the law enforcement agency, for the purposes set out in IPP2.2(g) and HPP2.2(j) (**)
  * be directed to the University Solicitor’s Office (1 Gheringhap Street, Geelong 3220 or privacy@deakin.edu.au).



Deakin releases information when legally required to do so. Search warrants, subpoenas and court orders should be served on the University Solicitor (1 Gheringhap Street, Geelong 3220).

### Employers and recruitment agencies

Prospective employers and recruitment agencies often seek to verify that a student has received an award (a degree, graduate certificate or graduate diploma) from Deakin.

To facilitate this, Deakin maintains [GradSearch](http://www.deakin.edu.au/gradsearch), an online qualification verification tool. To search for a graduate, two search items from the following list must be provided: surname / date of birth / student ID. Please note that GradSearch does not provide a full transcript of results.
