Dealitem.com respects the privacy and security of 
its users. Our goal is to provide you with a personalized Internet 
experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are 
most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, we 
sometimes collect information during your visits to understand what 
differentiates you from each of our millions of other users.
<br><br><p>In order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have 
prepared this statement disclosing the privacy practices for the entire 
Dealitem.com site. Additional terms and conditions regarding the collection 
and use of your information are also be provided to you before you 
register for our site. Here, you will learn what personally identifiable 
information of yours is collected, how and when we might use your 
information, how we protect your information, who has access to your 
information, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.
<br><br></p><p><b>What information is collected:</b>
<br><br></p><p>Dealitem.com collects certain information from and about its users in 
three ways -- directly from the user, from our Web server logs, and with 
cookies.
<br><br></p><p>User-Supplied Information: When you register for Dealitem.com, we may 
ask you for your name, email address, and some other personal information. 
The more accurate information you volunteer, the better we are able to 
customize your Dealitem.com experience.
<br><br></p><p>Server Log Information: When you visit an Internet Web site, you 
disclose certain information about yourself, such as your Internet 
Protocol (IP) address, the time of your visit, and the referring location 
(e.g., the Site or page that offered a link to a Dealitem.com page). 
Dealitem.com, like many other sites, records this basic 
information about visits to its site.
<br><br></p><p>Cookies: In order to offer and provide a customized, personal service, 
Dealitem.com uses cookies to store and help track your information as you 
travel throughout the site. For example, we may use cookies to help remind 
us who you are and to deliver content and services based upon your account 
information. In addition, third party advertising networks may issue 
cookies when serving advertisements.
<br><br></p><p>Cookies are simply pieces of information that are sent to your browser 
from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. The use of 
cookies is relatively standard and you will likely find them used on most 
other major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept 
cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you 
when you receive a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should 
understand that certain areas of many sites may not function properly if 
you set your browser to not accept cookies or if you reject a cookie.
<br><br></p><p>You should remember that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal 
information online, such as in message boards, through e-mail, discussion 
groups, or in chat areas, your information can be collected and used by 
others. Allthough Dealitem.com tries to protect your personal 
information, Dealitem.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of 
any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You 
are also solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords 
you set up and/or any account information.
<br><br></p><p><b>How and When Information is Used</b>:
<br><br></p><p>We use information in different ways, depending on the type of 
information: User-supplied information: This information is used for 
purposes such as personalization and verification.
<br><br></p><p>Web Server Logs: This information helps us identify which areas of our 
site are of interest to our visitors. Dealitem.com also collects the 
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of its visitors for the purposes of 
system administration and to report aggregate information to our 
advertisers.
<br><br></p><p>Cookies: We use cookies to let you use our services more easily and to 
let us keep track of certain statistical information that helps us improve 
our site. Cookies allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so 
that you won't have to re-enter them the next time you visit.<br><br></p><p>

Your Email Address:  We use your email address to send you information 
about your dealighted account, such as your username and password, 
and confirmations of reviews that you have submitted to the site.  From 
time to time, we may email you to let you know about new site features no 
more frequently than once per month but generally only a few times per 
year.  Your email address is never sold or otherwise provided to a 3rd 
party.<br><br></p><p>

<br><br></p><p><b>How We Protect Your Information:</b>
<br><br></p><p>The privacy and protection of your personal information is vitally 
important to us. Dealitem.com does not make personal information available 
to any third parties without your permission. Any user statistics that we 
may provide to prospective advertisers or partners regarding your 
Dealitem.com usage are provided in the aggregate only and do not include 
any personally identifiable information about any individual user.
<br><br></p><p>Your access to some services and content is password protected. We 
recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Dealitem.com 
will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an 
unsolicited email. You should not disclose your user name and password to 
others. In addition, if applicable, you should remember to sign out of 
your Dealitem.com account or service at the end of each session. You may 
also wish to close your browser window when you have finished your work. 
This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and 
correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a 
computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
<br><br></p><p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 
to be 100% secure. Accordingly, despite our efforts to protect your 
personal information, Dealitem.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of 
any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or 
services. You transmit all such information to us at your own risk. 
However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort 
to 
ensure its security on our systems.
<br><br></p><p><b>Who Has Access to the Information:</b>
<br><br></p><p>Except as described below, Dealitem.com will not 
willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about its 
users to any third party without first receiving that user's permission. 
Dealitem.com may disclose personal information when 
we believe in good faith that the law requires it or to protect the rights 
or property of Dealitem.com. Dealitem.com's 
Dealitem.com will use its best efforts to contact you if Dealitem.com is issued a subpoena or other legal process that requests your 
identity.
<br><br></p><p>When you are at the Dealitem.com site and asked for personal 
information, you share that information with Dealitem.com alone, unless the 
service is offered in conjunction with another party. For example, some 
Dealitem.com services are offered in conjunction 
with another company. In order to provide such co-branded services to you, 
it is necessary for us to share your personal information with the company 
offering the co-branded service. If you do not want your data to be 
shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of data by not using that 
particular service. If you choose to share your data with a provider of a 
co-branded service, you should understand that those providers may have 
separate privacy and data collection practices. Dealitem.com has 
no control over and accepts no liability for these independent practices. 
Each provider shouldmore information regarding its privacy and/or use 
policies.

<br><br></p><p>We use third-party 
advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These 
companies may use information (not including your name, address, email 
address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites 
in order to provide advertisements on this site, other sites, and other interactive media about 
goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more

this information used by these companies, please

<br><br></p><p>If you use another Dealitem.com service, we may send you a 
confirmation e-mail confirming your new account and/or service. The 
message will be sent to the address that you supplied us and will describe 
ways for you to change or delete the account information provided. 
Remember to keep the confirmation e-mail as it will also contain 
information that will help you in case you run into problems accessing our
