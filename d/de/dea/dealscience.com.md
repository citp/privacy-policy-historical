What information we collect 

Information you provide 

If you use our Service to search travel, we receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. This might include information about you (“personal information”) including your name, email address, and zip code. We will also store a username and password, should you choose to create an account directly with us at any time. We also receive and store information related to your travel searches on our site, including your destination, dates, and other attributes such as number of rooms and number of occupants. 

Third party login information 

Currently, goSeek allows users with accounts on third party services such as Facebook and Google to register and log into our Service using functionality that those third party services provide. By using this functionality to log into our Service, you permit us to retrieve, store, and use specific identifying information related to your accounts with these third party services. This information includes items such as your first name, last name, email address, and your location (if you have provided it to them). 

“Automatically collected” information 

We automatically collect some information about your device when you visit goSeek. For example, we will collect your IP address and information related to your operating system and web browsing software (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, or Mozilla Firefox, as well as version numbers). We may also collect information about your online activity, such as pages viewed, time on site, and number of clicks. Our goal in collecting this information is to help improve and customize your experience with our Service. 

Cookies and other similar web technologies 

We use several common web tracking tools to help identify you and collect usage information as you use our Service over time and across different platforms. We also work with third parties that collect and use information this way. The tools we use include “cookies” (a small piece of data that a web server places in a file on your computer) and “web beacons” (single pixel GIF images that are placed in the code of a web page or in an email newsletter). If you are concerned about our use of these technologies, most web browsers provide users the ability to limit the use of cookies and web beacons by adjusting their privacy settings. 

How we use that information 

In general 

We use the information that you provide to better tailor our experience to you and your needs, so that our Service becomes inherently more useful over time. 

Email address 

We will use your email address to give you updates on how our Service is evolving, as well as to provide you with promotional materials and offers, should you give us permission. It is our goal to have promotions be useful and relevant to you, and we want them to become increasingly so over time. 

Cookies and other similar web technologies 

We use web tracking tools such as cookies and web beacons for the following purposes 

  1. To distinguish new versus returning users to our Service 
  2. To help remember specific information about you from a prior visit to our Service so that we can better customize our site to meet your needs 
  3. To work with online advertising companies to display targeted advertising on our Service and other third party services that you might visit. This targeting may be based on information you provide to us or your browsing behavior while using our Service. It may also be based on your browsing behavior on other services. We may also obtain browsing history and other demographic information about you from our partners in order to better target advertising displayed while you are using our Service. When we show you advertising on goSeek, it is our hope that it will be useful and relevant. Our use of cookies and web beacons is only to help support that goal. If you are uncomfortable with targeted advertising, there are mechanisms to opt out of it. For more information, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>
