					DearDiary.Net... has created this privacy statement in order to
					demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.  The following discloses our
					information gathering and dissemination practices for our various websites.

					</p><p>We collect, log and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server,
					and to administer our Web site.  Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information,
					to determine very roughly where our visitors come from.

					</p><p>Our sites use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and
					settings, and for session management to ensure you can successfully log in
					to your account.

					</p><p>Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information
					(like name and email address) and demographic information (country, gender etc).
					We use customer contact information from the registration
					 form to occasionally send the user information about our company.  The customer's contact information
					 is also used to contact the visitor when necessary.  Contact
					information is used to ensure publishers are accountable for their published
					works and indeed credited for their works should a third party (including
					DearDiary.Net) wish to use such works. The gathered information is never
					disseminated outside of the company except where required for legal purposes.

</p><p><font size="+1" color="Red"><b>NOTICE TO PARENTS:</b></font> To comply with the
United States Law for the protection of your childs privacy (Children Online Privacy
Protection Act), we do not ask for the age of any child. However, if you believe
your child has an account with us, and you wish to request that the details are
removed from our database, please mail <a href="mailto:support@deardiary.net">support@deardiary.net</a>
to request this. You will need to be prepared to prove you are the childs
parent or guardian, and please note that we cannot (and aren't obliged by COPPA)
to bar your child from using our service, however we will (as parents ourselves)
treat each case on an individual basis and do our best to help. This may simply
mean the removal of the childs email address from our system and therefore
restricting access to areas of the service that absolutely require that information.
</p><p>
<font size="+1" color="Red"><b>NOTICE TO UNDER 13's:</b></font> If you reside
in the United States of America, this applies to you. The law of your country states
that if we are aware that you are under 13, we must get your parents consent
to hold data that can identify you. This means, that we must remove your email
address and any other personal information about your account, if we discover
or are made aware that you are under 13. Unlike other diary sites we do not
believe in banning any segment of the population, however, there are certain
features of the site that absolutely require your email address. So, if we
become aware that you are under 13, some features of the site will be disabled
until we can gain your parents/guardians consent to hold your email address.
<b>Please do NOT give information that may enable
someone to know who you are! The internet, just like a crowded park or shopping
mall can be a dangerous place. Do not give information to anyone about who
you are.</b>
</p><p>

					</p><p>Demographic information (country, etc) can sometimes be used for statistical
					analysis, but in such cases the analysis will be of a broad nature and will not
					be related or relateable to any individual user(s) of the site.

					</p><p>Our sites contains links to other sites. <b>DearDiary.Net</b> are
					 not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

					</p><p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.

				   This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available

					 are under 13 years of age and reside in the USA, we may have to restrict your
					 access to ensure that we comply with your laws. You will still be able to access
					 most of the sites, though you will have to send any posts to our support address
					 so that we can ensure there is no personally identifying information included in them.
