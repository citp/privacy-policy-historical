You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information on their practices as well as for instructions about how to opt out of certain practices. Deal Seeking Mom’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

There are occasions when I will ask for personal information, such as when you enter a giveaway.

I will not sell or exchange your personal information at any time. I will collect general information (such as the type of browser you use, the files you request, and the domain name and country from which you request information) to improve my Website and better meet your needs.

Before I collect any personally identifiable information, I will provide an explanation for the possible use of your data.
