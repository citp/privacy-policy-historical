dealnews does not collect personal identifying information unless
such information is specifically and knowingly provided from users
during contests, surveys, sweepstakes, site registration, or use
of public areas, such as a forum. From time to time, we share 
aggregated site traffic information with our partners and 
advertisers. As part of our affiliate program, we track individual 
user movement that is not personally identifiable. We do this to 
track the effectiveness of our affiliate program. This data is not 
linked to any personally identifiable information.</p><p><b>Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms</b></p><p>If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware 
that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, 
collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you
unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable 
information you choose to submit in these forums.</p><p><b>Third Party Offers or Mailing Lists</b></p><p>Users will occasionally receive information on products, 
services, special deals, and newsletters (ours or a third party's) if 
those users have opted to receive such communication. Out of respect 
for the privacy of our users, we only send these types of 
communications if the user "opts-in". (Please see the Choice: Opt-In 
and Opt-Out section.) Users of our site are always notified when 
their information is being collected by any outside parties (e.g., if 
we implement Third Party Mailing Lists). We do this so our users can 
make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with 
services that require an outside party. dealnews is not responsible 
for any actions or policies of such outside parties.</p><p><b>Choice: Opt-In and Opt-Out</b></p><p>Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-in" to having their 
information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the 
point where we ask for information. dealnews does not supply 
identifying information to other companies, or use such information 
for its own purposes including but not limited to email newsletters, 
unless the user "opts-in" for such purposes by specifically 
allowing usage. (Identifying information must necessarily be used 
when notifying a user of requested information, such as email used 
for the alerts function, and notification of a winning entry in a 
contest or sweepstakes.)</p><p>Once subscribed, users who no longer wish to receive our 
newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of (i.e., 
discontinue receiving) these communications by replying to 
unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or contact us via
<a href="http://dealnews.com/contact.html?dept=privacy">this online contact form</a>. 
We also offer opt-out mechanisms in the text of each email we send, and the 
user may contact us at the street address at the top of this page to 
opt-out.</p><p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip
code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires
our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate
users' personally identifiable information. This can be done at
<a href="http://dealnews.com/preferences.html?pref_view=profile">mydealnews</a>
or by contacting us via <a href="http://dealnews.com/contact.html?dept=privacy">this online contact form</a>.</p><p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need 
to disclose personal information when required by law if we have a 
good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a 
judicial proceeding, a court order, or a legal process served on our 
Web site.</p><p>On rare occasions, it is necessary to send out a strictly 
service-related announcement. For instance, if our service is 
temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send users an email. 
Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, although 
they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are 
not promotional in nature.</p><p><b>Security</b></p><p>dealnews uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information
disclosed to us secure. However, dealnews is not responsible for
any breach of security. If a dealnews user knowingly provides
personal information, such as a name or email address, in a forum
or other public service, that user should be aware that the information
provided can be collected and used by third parties. Such activities
are beyond the control of dealnews. However, at registration a user 
can choose whether an email is disclosed in the profile/post of the 
forum user.</p><p>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a 
friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email 
address. dealnews will automatically send the friend a one-time 
email inviting them to visit the site. dealnews stores this 
information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and 
tracking the success of our referral program.</p><p><b>Cookies</b></p><p>Non-personal information and data may be automatically collected
through the standard operation of dealnews' Internet servers (i.e. 
log file information like IP address) or through the use of 
"cookies." Cookies are small text files that our site 
places on your computer's hard drive to recognize repeat users and 
facilitate the user's use of the site. Also, our cookies allow a site 
to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data for content 
improvement, targeted advertising, and marketing and promotional 
purposes.</p><p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for 
example, advertisers). Users should be aware that dealnews cannot 
control the use of cookies or the resulting information by 
advertisers or other third parties. Most browsers allow a user to 
deny cookies; however, users should note that cookies may be required 
to provide certain web site features.</p><p><b>Third Party Advertising</b></p><p>Some of the ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by
LinkShare, Commision Junction, and BeFree, our Web advertising 
partners. Information about users' visits to this site, such as 
number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, 
or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this 
site. For more information about LinkShare, Commission Junction, 
BeFree, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please review <a href="http://www.linkshare.com/home/privacy.shtml">LinkShare's</a>,

policies. Please understand we have no access to or control over 
these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies 
for advertising.</p><p><b>ATTENTION KIDS</b></p><p>ATTENTION KIDS: No information should be submitted to dealnews
by children under 18 years of age without their parent's or guardian's
consent. dealnews does not monitor the age of its user audience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>dealnews reserves the right to change this policy at any time by 
posting notice of the existence of a new privacy statement. If we 
decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to 
this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem 
appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we 
collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we 
disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy 
policy under which the information was collected.</p><p>This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended 
to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on 
behalf of any party.</p><p><small>(Last modified 20070503)</small>
