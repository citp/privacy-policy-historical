By continuing to use the Service after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Notice as modified. Your access of the Service for the limited and exclusive purpose of reviewing this Privacy Notice does not constitute your acceptance of this Notice unless you make any further access or use of our Service.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span><strong><font color="#7a1b51">Your California Privacy Rights</font></strong><br>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.

This may include information that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name, email address, or postal address. Some examples of this type of information include information that you electronically submit when you contact us with questions or participate in contests, surveys or sweepstakes, information that you post on blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social networking areas on our Service, and information that you electronically submit when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain features of our Service. We also may ask for information (including a credit card number and other financial information) from those users who make purchases or have payment transactions on our Service.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>Location Information.&nbsp;We may collect location information (e.g., city and state and/or zip code) that you provide. Certain devices and browsers contain unique identifiers that can be used to identify the geographical location of the device. When you use such a device or browser to access our Service, your device and/or browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your location information. We also may collect GPS information from the device if the device transmits it. Additionally, if you download our app, we may collect your location information in order to deliver our app services. If you choose to enable certain features in our app that require your geographic location, then we will collect and store that information.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>Other Information Automatically Collected to Improve the Service and Deliver Targeted Advertising.&nbsp;We also collect and store information through a variety of automatic technologies, such as browser and flash cookies, pixels and web beacons about your use of our Service, including device identifying information such as IP addresses, MAC address or other device-specific alphanumerical ID numbers, the make and model of your device, the wireless provider associated with your device, whether you downloaded the app, the source of the download of the app (for example, whether via a particular advertisement for the app), when the app is launched, how many times a particular page within the Service is visited, which features the users interact with, and your device or computer's connection to the Internet. If you choose to connect to our Service through a social network such as Facebook, we may automatically collect your profile information. These things allow us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Service.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>The information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a third-party website hosting provider, or another third-party service provider, on our behalf.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>We also may use "cookies" and other similar technologies on the Service. Cookies are small files that are placed on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes and to enhance your experience with the Service. By showing how and when visitors use the Service, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Service where you may have entered preference information before. This Service also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the Service or open HTML-formatted email messages.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span><font color="#7a1b51"><strong>How Information Is Used</strong><br></font>We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Service in a variety of ways, including, for example, for the purpose for which the information was submitted, to process your registration request, to provide you with services and communications that you have requested, to send you email updates and other communications, to customize features and advertising that appear on the Service, to deliver our Service content to you, to measure Service traffic, measure user interests and traffic patterns, and to improve the Service and the services and features offered via the Service.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>We may use location information, either information provided by you or information automatically collected, in order to provide you with content, services and advertising that are relevant to your geographic area.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>We may combine information we collect from you while you are using our Service with information that we collect from other sources to customize features, content and advertising that appear on our Service.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>In addition, we may use any information submitted by or collected from you via the Service for any purpose related to the Service, including to contact you for customer service purposes, to inform you of important changes or additions to our Service or the services offered over our Service, and to send you administrative notices and any other communications that we believe may be of interest to you.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>Your Choices.&nbsp;When we request information from you on the Service, you may always choose not to provide us with that information. But if you decline to supply or provide us with certain information while using the Service, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Service.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>If you want to limit the information that is automatically collected while you use our Service, most Web browsers allow you to disable certain functionality or set certain privacy setting. If you choose to disable cookies or turn off other functionality, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Service.
