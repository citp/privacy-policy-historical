# Shopping.com - Shopping made simple

October 5th, 2006 

### Your Privacy

The websites in the Shopping.com Network -- Shopping.com, the Shopping.com cart at shopping.ebay.com, Epinions.com, DealTime.com and PriceTool.com -- are brought to you by Shopping.com, Inc., an eBay company. This Privacy Policy tells you how Shopping.com uses and protects your information.

By using the Shopping.com Network, you agree to the terms and conditions of the User Agreement, including this Privacy Policy, and you consent to Shopping.com's privacy practices. This includes the use and disclosure of any personal information you have shared with us and its transfer to and storage on our servers in the United States. 

### Collection

You can browse the Shopping.com Network without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Certain features and services on the Shopping.com Network require that you register and supply some information that allows us to identify you. We collect some information automatically from your computer while you browse our sites, such as where you go on the Shopping.com Network and what you do there. We collect your IP address, computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform, the URLs you come from and go to next, and a cookie number. 

When you register on one of the sites in the Shopping.com Network, we collect and store your e-mail address and a password. You can also choose to provide the following personal information:  


  * Member profile information, including first and last name, member name and location
  * Fulfillment information, including mailing address and phone number
  * Transaction and payment information, including credit card number and billing address
  * Other information that allows us to personalize your Shopping.com Network experience—for example, your filter and profile preferences and the items on your Epinions Wish List



We may get additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, you might contact Community Care or customer support or respond to a survey, or we might get a third-party complaint about you. 

**Co-Branded Services.** Shopping.com works with some website operators to provide co-branded services. You will know you are on a co-branded website when the co-brand partner’s logo appears at the top of the page. When you visit a co-branded website, you are subject to that website’s privacy policy. Shopping.com does not receive any personal information about you from that website operator. 

### Use

We use the information we collect to:  


  * operate the Shopping.com Network
  * provide you with information and services you request
  * customize your experience on the Shopping.com Network
  * communicate with you about your orders, service updates and other administrative issues
  * send our Epinions members targeted marketing and promotional offers, based on their communications preferences
  * contact our Epinions Category Leads, Advisors or Top Reviewers (for more information, see [Epinions' FAQs](http://www.epinions.com/help/faq/?show=faq_recognition))
  * measure and improve our sites and services
  * resolve disputes, address complaints and troubleshoot technical problems 
  * analyze site and user behavior and prepare aggregated reports 



### Sharing and Disclosure

**Shopping.com Cart Merchants.** If you purchase an item through the Shopping.com cart, we will provide the merchant with information necessary to complete that transaction. The merchants may use the information to fulfill the transaction and for other purposes for which they have obtained your consent. 

**Other eBay Companies.** We may share information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures or other companies under common control, where it may be used to provide joint services or for purposes such as internal statistics, strategic decision-making, customer reviews, identifying customer trends, customer verification, fraud prevention and security.

**Service Providers.** We may share your information with service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as maintaining the Shopping.com Network and providing related services).

**Special Offers.** On the Shopping.com Network, you may have opportunities to express interest in or register for third-party products and services. If you do, we will provide information about you to the third party to implement your request.

**Epinions Category Leads.** Category Leads may have access to some or all of our Epinions databases. For more information about Category Leads, see [Epinions' FAQs.](http://www.epinions.com/help/faq/?show=faq_recognition)

**Feedback.** We may use survey results for our internal development and market research and share the results with our affiliates, consultants, vendors and service providers.

**Assets.** As our business evolves, Shopping.com may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such an event, personal information may be one of the assets transferred.

**Other Disclosures.** We may disclose information when permitted by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary under applicable law; to comply with legal process served on Shopping.com; to protect the property or interests of Shopping.com, its agents and employees; or to protect personal safety or the public. 

### Public Content

Some portions of the Shopping.com Network allow you to contribute ratings, comments, reviews and other content to the site. This content is displayed publicly unless you register and change your default configuration. The reviews and comments you publish may be displayed with your member name. If other members choose to, they can receive email notifications of your new public content or publish their own comments to your reviews.

We may use the public content to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and market products. We may use your public content to personalize site views and identify or feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular or highest-earning reviews and members. While we don't expect to transfer the complete review rating and web of trust database to others (except as discussed in this policy), we use the database throughout our network and to generate results for others.

### E-mail Communications

**Choice/Opt-Out.** At any time, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications from Epinions, but you may not opt out of administrative emails (for example, emails about your transactions or policy changes) while you are a member of the Shopping.com Network. You can opt out by either changing your [e-mail preferences](http://www.epinions.com/myaccount.html) or using the link provided at the bottom of each email message. 

**Email Tools.** If you send emails to a recipient through our site, they will receive your email address and any personal message you include. Although we do not retain in any easily retrievable way the addresses you email, these emails are not private communications. You may not use our email tools to send spam or content that violates the User Agreement.

**Anti-Spam Policy.** Shopping.com does not tolerate spam. We do not send emails to anyone without permission, and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any unauthorized third party. This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. If you believe that you have received an unsolicited email from us, please contact our Privacy Department and we will investigate. 

### Cookies and Web Beacons

**Shopping.com's Cookies.** Shopping.com, and other members of our corporate family who provide us with joint services, will sometimes place anonymous cookies or web beacons on your computer when you visit our sites or our co-branded sites. We use these cookies and web beacons to recognize returning users, measure traffic and activity on the sites, monitor and improve our services and protect against fraud.

You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you. Your browser must be set to accept cookies in order to access the Shopping.com Network as a registered member.

**Our Advertisers's Cookies.** We use the services of third-party advertising companies, who may place cookies that allow them to collect from you and use anonymous information about your visits to the Shopping.com Network.

We may retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce our User Agreement and take other actions otherwise permitted by law. If your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we may maintain some information to prevent re-registration. 

### Links to Other Sites

The Shopping.com Network contains links to other websites. Shopping.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other websites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site's own privacy policy.

### Security

Shopping.com uses physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, including advanced firewall and password protection for our databases, designed to protect the security of information. We restrict access to your personal information to employees that need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

### General

We may change this policy from time to time, and we will post the amended terms on the Shopping.com Network. All amended terms will take effect immediately for new users, and 30 days after they are posted for existing users.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the practices of the Shopping.com Network, you may e-mail our [Privacy Department](https://web.archive.org/aa27-cs_form?subject=Privacy%20Issues) or contact:
