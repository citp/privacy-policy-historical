# Dealio: Privacy Policy

**Effective on: October 1, 2004**

These terms are incorporated by reference into Vendio's User Agreement at <http://www.dealio.com/terms.html> and are subject to such User Agreement. Your use of any of Vendio's services is subject to the User Agreement in its entirety 

**1\. Passwords**  
You may not disclose your password to any third party. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information. In addition, you may run the risk of another user accessing your password and using it to falsely represent your identity. If you have reason to believe that your password has been compromised for any reason, Vendio strongly recommends that you immediately change your password. 

  **2\. Information Collected**

> **2.1. Cookies.** We also use cookies on certain pages of our site, and for services requiring registration. This is done primarily for your benefit as cookies allow you to log on only once per session. Most cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a session. In addition, many browsers offer users the option of declining cookies. If you do not wish to accept cookies, please modify the settings in your browser. Your browser must be set to accept cookies if you wish to use the Vendio services available only to registered members. These cookies are not tied to your personal information. 
> 
> **2.2. Information You Provide.** To post messages on our message center or to use any of our other services we may require you to provide us with contact information, such as your name, street address, phone number, and email address. In the event that you are using a paid service we may collect your credit card number, expiration date, and billing information. We may also transmit your credit card to partners, such as universal registration partners, whom you specifically select to receive this information.  
> Additionally, if a friend or associate refers you to Vendio, you have the option to provide their user name during registration so they get credit for the referral. 
> 
> **2.3. Information We Track.** As you use our services, our servers will automatically track certain information about you in log files. This information includes your IP address, the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, which browser you are using, and which operating system you are using. This is not unique to the Vendio website as many existing sites automatically collect this information. These log files are not linked to your personal information. Vendio also records participation in our online communities, including messages submitted, contributions through wikis or buying guides, and reviews/ratings. 

**3\. Disclosure of Information.**

> **3.1. Listing Services.** To utilize our auction listing services, or to attach images to an auction, we may request your user name and password for the auction site(s) that you are using. This information is forwarded directly to the auction site for processing. It is not processed or stored by Vendio. 
> 
> **3.2. Referrals.** Users who refer other users under our referral program may view usage data in the aggregate for their referrals.
> 
> **3.3. Demographic Information.** We aggregate broad demographic and usage information on our user base, which we disclose to our current and prospective advertisers. In addition, this aggregated data is used internally for promotional purposes. We use the information about the interests our users to increase the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional efforts and to customize our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to create a personalized product that better satisfies our users' needs. We may also use information about you to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners. 
> 
> **3.4. Personally Identifiable Information.** We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise share any personally identifiable information about our users to any third party, except with your consent or for the specific purposes described in this statement. If you register for Vendio through a co-branded or private-labeled site, registration information may also be provided to the co-branded or private-labeled site. This includes, but is not limited to the names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of our users. You should refer to the privacy policy of the co-branded site to review their data collection and handling policies. In addition, except as we describe here we will not disclose any personally identifiable financial or security related personally identifiable information such as credit card numbers and or passwords. 
> 
> **3.5. Online Communities.** If you participate in the online communities provided by Vendio (for example, our message boards, wikis, product buying guides, reviews/ratings, etc.), your username will be posted along with your contributions. Users are also given the opportunity to create a profile that may be viewed by other users. Users are given the option when entering this information to make it viewable by other users or request that it remain private. If the user chooses to opt-in to this option of disclosing their information to third parties or other users, then the user may receive promotional items. You may later elect to opt-out in accordance with section 9. 
> 
> **3.6. Compelled Disclosure.** Unfortunately, we cannot ensure the absolute privacy of any personally identifiable user information. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to government and/or law enforcement agencies or third parties under certain circumstances. Vendio cooperates with all law enforcement inquiries and reserves the right to reveal your identity (or whatever information we know about you) in the event of a complaint or legal action arising from your use of the services or features on the Vendio website. In addition, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we make it a practice not to disclose any personally identifiable information to any third party, we do not promise that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private. 

**4\. Use of Information**

> 
> **4.6. Service Providers.** We use service providers to help us perform some of the services on our site.

> 
> **4.7. Contests.** We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information such as their email address, full name, and street address.

> 
> **4.8. External Service Providers.** This site contains links to many other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

We encourage you to ask questions and review their stated privacy policies before you disclose your personal information to others. 
> 
> **4.9. Advertisements.** We use outside advertising companies to display ads on our site. These advertisements may contain cookies.

> 
> **6.3. Spam.** If you choose to opt-in to allowing other users to view your email address when registering, you should use discretion.

**7\. Security**  
Vendio uses industry standard efforts such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. However, even the most robust security systems are not foolproof and users should consider this when revealing any personally identifiable information to any party over any form of media. 

  **8\. Opting Out**  
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about the visitor. However, if a user decides at any time not to receive future communications, the user may remove their information from our database by sending an email to [privacy@corp.vendio.com](mailto:privacy@corp.vendio.com).

In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
