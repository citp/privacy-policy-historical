DR will use your Personal Information to operate and facilitate your use of the Website, including but not limited to internal review, to improve the content of the Website, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Website and applicable laws or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Website. DR does not store your payment information, and will only use it for processing.

**With Whom We Share Your Personal Information**  
DR will not sell your personal information to third parties. In an effort to display offers that may be of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Website. As a result of your use of the Website, such ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, IP address and clickstream information. DR may engage third parties to help us provide the Website and manage our business, although these organizations are subject to confidentiality obligations and may only use your Personal Information for the purposes DR defines.

Beyond what is explained in this Policy, DR will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties unless disclosure is reasonably necessary as part of a transaction to sell all or part of the DR business, to comply with law, law enforcement officials, in response to a validly issued subpoena, warrant, court order, or is otherwise permitted by applicable law.

**Dealership Accounts**  
Accounts belonging to dealerships may privately contact reviewers through our site on items related to a consumer review. When dealers make such contact, email addresses are not provided to either party without prior consent.
