Cookies & IP Information

"Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed by a Web site in a storage place on your computer. Cookies do not contain information that is, in itself, personally identifying. Cookies may be placed on your computer in a limited way to help deliver advertisements, to calculate unique site visitors, and to track usage throughout our site. Other uses include placement of cookies to make the login process more convenient for users of our E-mail newsletters, our archives, our online content, and our online discussion forums. In addition, some advertisers may place cookies on your computer. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of various features on our site that are available to other visitors. 

When you use our site, we may also collect your browser type, access time, and/or Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and keep records of this information. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. Like the IP address, none of this other information identifies you personally; we collect it for aggregate reporting on site activity that we, and our advertisers, may use. The aggregate information helps to understand our audience and confirm the value of the advertising on our website. 

Credit Card Information

When you make a purchase, we ask you to provide your credit card information so that we can process your payment. During the ordering process, such credit card information is transmitted to Dear Doctor or to one of our suppliers or service providers. In both cases, credit card information is then transmitted to third-party credit card processors and card issuers that must use your information to process your order. 

Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

No one under the age of 13 should provide any personal information. Dear Doctor does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without verified parental consent prior to collection.

If you believe the Web site has any information about anyone under 13, please contact us at webmaster@deardoctor.com. 

Security

The personally identifiable information we collect is securely stored within our database, and we use standard, industry-wide procedures such as encryption and firewalls for protecting your information. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a message you post to any message board, discussion group, or other public posting area on our sites is available to anyone with Internet access.
