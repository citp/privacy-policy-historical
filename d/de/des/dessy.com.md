## Personal Information that we collect:

We do not collect personal information from you on the Web site unless you voluntarily provide it to us, such as by ordering a product, inquiring about a product, purchasing a product, using our chat service, registering to use a particular service or otherwise choosing to share your personal information with us. The personal information which you may provide to us could include your name, email address, physical address and payment information.

## Non-personal or Aggregate Information that we collect:

When you access our Web site, we may automatically collect non-personal information from you, such as referring web site, IP address, web pages viewed, browser type, usage and browsing habits on the Web site and similar data. We may also aggregate demographic information collected from our users (such as the number of users in a particular state) in a manner which does not identify any one individual.

## Information Usage, Disclosure and Recipients:

  * We may send your personal information to other group companies, affiliates and third parties to help us process your personal information for the purposes set out in this policy. 
  * We will only use your personal information as described below, unless you have specifically consented to another type of use, either at the time the personal information is collected from you or through some other form of consent from you:
  * We will use personal information to complete any orders you have placed.
  * We will use personal information to provide you with the specific services that you have requested, such as to reach a retailer.
  * We will use your personal information to respond to questions that you send to us.
  * We will use your personal information to send you emails from time to time, such as newsletters and notices about our promotions.
  * We may permit our vendors and subcontractors to access your personal information, but they are only permitted to do so in connection with performing services for us. They are not authorized by us to use the information for their own benefit. For instance, we may share your personal information with a credit card processing company or shipping provider to process orders that you have placed.

Non-personal or aggregate information may be shared with any number of parties, provided that such information shall not specifically identify you.

We may receive data from other sources outside of your use of the Web site and combine that information with data collected from the Web site. When we do so, we will use the combined information as set forth in this privacy policy. 

## Interest Based Advertising:

We may ourselves, or with third party vendors, use non-personal information in connection with our own or vendor information to deliver targeted advertising to you when you visit other web sites or our Service. Cookies, clickstream data, and other similar technologies described below may be used in this process. For example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, we or our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other web sites you view with information on that product. This form of advertising, sometimes called “behavioral advertising,” is based on anonymous information and not on any personal information. As a result, we and our vendor know your interests, but do not personally identify you in connection with the delivery of that specific ad. We believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests. However, if you would like to opt out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below under the section “Opt-Out Process”.

## Cross Device Matching:

We use non-personal information to facilitate cross device association. We or our third party vendors analyze device activity data using a mathematical tool known as a “probabilistic algorithm” to determine if you have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices. In connection with this analysis, we may rely on non-personal information (including demographic, geographic and interest-based data) from third parties such as data vendors, pursuant to their own privacy policies or we may use the non-personal information we collect in conjunction with such third party data. Based on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated and may provide other services to our advertisers such as tools, analyses, data and insights to see how their web site or mobile applications are used and to further enable the display of targeted advertisements to you, including across your devices. Our advertisers may also provide us with deterministic data about you that may be used to supplement our probabilistic data. Based on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated and may provide other services to our advertisers such as tools, analyses, data and insights to see how their web site or mobile applications are used and to further enable cross-device targeting and analysis. For further instructions on restricting our use of certain cross-device data, please see the “Opt-Out Process” section below. Cookies and Similar Technologies: "Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that web site. Many web sites use cookies for these purposes.

Such data may include, without limitation, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your device type, and general location data.

## Clickstream Data:

As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as “clickstream data,” can be collected and stored by a website’s server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of device and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the Service. We may collect and use clickstream data to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on websites, how visitors navigate throughout websites and how we may tailor our Service to better meet consumer needs. This information will be used to improve our Service and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous, and will not intentionally contain any personal information.

## Security:

The security of your personal information is very important to us. We attempt to provide for the secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers by utilizing encryption software. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and The Dessy Group or information stored on the Web site or our servers, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of the Web site demonstrates your assumption of this risk. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.

We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. Even if we delete some or all of your personal information, we may continue to retain and use anonymous or aggregated data previously collected. Please note that we will not be liable for disclosures of your data due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties.

## Other Web Sites:

As a convenience to you, we may provide links to third-party web sites from within the Web site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites. When you link away from our Web site, you do so at your own risk.

_Opting out of interest based advertising_

The online advertising industry provides a service through which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from certain data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. We comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising set forth by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). You can opt-out of targeted advertising from certain providers at www.aboutads.info/consumers. Please note that by opting out, you will continue to see generic advertising that is not tailored to your specific interests and activities. To be clear, cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted out on your device browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device.
