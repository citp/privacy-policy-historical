# Desygner - Privacy Policy

## Our commitment to you

We make it real easy to protect your information, so that you never have to worry who sees what, as each design you create has its own privacy settings.

  1. Simply, choose between a public profile (anyone can follow you) or a private profile (people will have to request your permission to follow you). In either case, you will still control which _projects_ people can and cannot view.
  2. Choose the privacy options for every design you create, either;
    * Make it public, so the world can see it.
    * Make it available only to your followers.
    * Make it available to co-desygners and users you tag.
    * Make it completely private, and it will be only ever visible to your co-desygners.



As we need to provide detailed information on our privacy policies, the page below was written to explain what information we collect, how your information is used and the options you have regarding your information. 

Our privacy policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who use the service we provide. Please feel free to [Contact Us](https://desygner.com/contact) if you have any questions about our privacy policy.

## Information Collection

### We collect information in 3 ways:

  


  1. When you provide it to us.  
When you sign up for Desygner, you voluntarily provide us certain information, including your name, photos, comments, likes, email address, and any other information you give to us. If you're using Desygner on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data.
  2. When you give us permission to obtain it.  
You may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may want to connect your Facebook or Instagram accounts to your Desygner account, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts, such as your contacts and photos. The information we obtain from these third-party websites often depends on your settings or their privacy policies.
  3. When you use our services we collect some information automatically.  

    * Log Data. Our system records information about your interaction with our products, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. Your browser or your mobile app sends us this information when you use them to access Desygner. Desygner uses Log Data to provide its services and to customize and improve them.
    * Cookies. Like many websites we may use "cookies" - a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk - or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit our website. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
    * Device Information. We also collect information about the device you're using Desygner on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. 

  


## Information Use

We use the information we collect to provide you a service, to make our products better, to develop new products; and to protect Desygner and our users. 

We also use the information we collect to offer you customised content - including suggesting you people to follow. 

We also use the information we collect to send you updates on Desygner's activities (such as your friends’ updates, invitations and comments) newsletters, marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating your account settings. 

The information we collect may be "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or "non-personally identifiable" (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you).

### Your choice

  


  * Access and change information in you profile at any time, and choose whether your design profile is public (anyone can follow you) or private (people will have to request your permission to follow you).
  * Access and change information on each design at any time, and choose whether each design is visible only by you and other creators, by your followers, by the tagged and contributors list or by everybody (public).
  * Link or unlink your Desygner account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Instagram).
  * Deactivate your account at any time. 



You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Desygner. For example:

  * The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage;
  * Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us.
  * To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider.

  


## Information Disclosure

Desygner is a tool people use to create their own designs. When you create public designs, anyone can view them. You may also provide us with profile page information that that anyone can view. The other limited instances where we may share your personal information include:

  * When we have your consent. This includes sharing information with other services (like Facebook or Twitter) when you’ve chosen to link to your Desygner account to those services or publish your activity on Desygner to them. For example, you can choose to share your designs on Facebook or Twitter.
  * We may employ third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at identifying spam or with our accountants to make sure we’re keeping the projects right.
  * In the course of operating the Desygner site, it is necessary to store on our network small images of finished designs for the projects that are created.
  * If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Desygner; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
  * We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.



If we engage in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

### Children’s information

We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent.

### Policies Changes

We may change this policy from time to time, and when we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. If you continue to use Desygner after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or obtain your consent as required by law.
