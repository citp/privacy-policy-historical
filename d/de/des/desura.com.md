## **DESURA**

## **ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY/ YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

January 31, 2015

Bad Juju Games, Inc. (“Bad Juju”), and its network of websites are committed to protecting your privacy. This Online Privacy Policy is intended to describe how your personal information is processed and used, and we will make every effort to ensure that our activities keep within the spirit of this Online Privacy Policy. Please note that by visiting and using www.desura.com (“Desura”) you are accepting the practices described in this Online Privacy Policy.

We take care to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13 who visit our websites. If you are under 18, please be sure to read this policy with your parents or legal guardians and ask questions about things you do not understand. Children under 13 should get your parent’s or legal guardian’s permission before giving out your e-mail address or any personal information to Desura or to anyone else on the Internet. **To learn about Desura’s Children Privacy Policy please click here.  **

  * **What Information does Bad Juju Collect?**



When users visit our website, purchase products, create accounts and register to receive materials, we may collect “Personally Identifiable Information” (commonly known as “PII”).  PII is any information that can be used to identify a particular individual, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit/debit card information or other contact information.  PII also includes information about your visits to our websites, including the pages you view, the links and ads you click, search terms you enter, and other actions you take in connection with Desura.

Bad Juju also collects non-personally identifiably information, which does not personally identify a particular user (“Collective Information”). Collective Information may include visitation patterns, demographics of users and search engine terms as a group.

  * **Why does Bad Juju collect PII or Collective Information?**



The purpose for this information is actually two-fold. One, Desura has found it advantageous to examine visitor traffic in its aggregate, so that we can ensure maximum compatibility for the various browsers and operating systems that visit our site. Additionally, as any business should attest, it is our desire to generate greater amounts of visitor traffic. By analyzing visitation patterns, referring URLs and search engine terms, we can strategically enhance our exposure on the Internet.

  * **Does Bad Juju Share or Store PII or Collective Information?**



We do not transmit, process or store any PII about our users to any third parties. We maintain a strict “No Spam or UCE” policy that means we do not intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third-party, without your consent.

We use a unique Desura ID (UID) that serves as the primary identification element for users associated with Desura, reducing reliance on PII for identification purposes.

We may, however, from time to time share Collective Information with our business partners, resellers, affiliates, and service providers, consulting partners and others in an effort to better serve you.

Any PII we collect may be shared with Bad Juju’s corporate affiliates, or companies who operate under the same corporate control. Bad Juju will take reasonable steps to ensure that these company affiliates honor this Online Privacy Policy and Children Privacy Policy.

However, we may disclose your PII if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Desura; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of Desura or users of our website.

  * **Your Choices Regarding Your PII**



If you choose not to provide any PII when requested on the website, you can still enjoy most areas on the website. However, you may be unable to access certain areas and services that require our interaction with you.

Bad Juju will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed to receive. If you are a member of our mailing list, you will be contacted with announcements, news, portfolio additions, and new products or services. You have the option of “Unsubscribing” from our mailing list at any time, thereby disabling any further such e-mail communication from being sent to you. If you wish to have specific communications with a member of the Desura staff, you will be required to provide specific information that will be routed to the appropriate contact within Desura.

  * **Third Party Links**



Desura uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our websites. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.

Desura further provides “links” to a wide variety of other web sites on the Internet, including access to social media features such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest buttons (such as “Like,” “Tweet” or “Pin”). We are not responsible for their Privacy Policies or how those web sites manage information about their users. Your interactions with third party links or the social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature. We strongly urge you to check with those web sites to determine their privacy policy and to control your privacy settings.

  * **Commitment to Data Security**



To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. All financial transactions are protected by 2048bit SSL encryption.

  * **Contact Us**



Please send any notices or request regarding this Privacy Policy by care of e-mail to: legal@desura.com.

  * **Notice To California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights:**



Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (known as the “Shine the Light” law), Desura customers who are residents of California may request certain information you have the right to request certain information regarding the disclosure of your information about our disclosure of personal information during the prior calendar year to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
