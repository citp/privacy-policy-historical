WTWH Media LLC ("WTWH", "we", or "us") is committed to ensuring the privacy of our users. The following is our privacy policy and we hope it clarifies how WTWH processes and uses certain information collected via the Design World Network of websites. A full listing of WTWH online properties can be found at wtwhmedia.com. By using our Sites, you consent to the terms of this Policy. 

**Information Collection When you visit our Site**   
Some information is automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type and the time and date of your visit. This information is collected through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by a Web site to give you a unique identification. 

We also use cookies on our Site to keep track of services you have used, to record registration information regarding your login name and password, to ensure you do not repeatedly see advertisements, to record your user preferences and to keep you logged into the Site. 

Additionally, we use, and allow third parties to use, various Web technologies on the Site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes. 

We use third parties, called third-party ad servers or network advertisers, to deliver ads to you on our behalf. These third-party ad servers may use cookies or other technology to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Site in order to use it to present advertisements that may be of interest to you.

**How We Use the Information**  
We use personal information to process your requests or transactions, provide you with products and services, and inform you about other products or services we think will be of interest. Certain registration information on premium content is shared with our business partners. For example Traceparts.net 3D content requires user registration to download models. Also, we use the information we collect to: 

* contact you for administrative purposes or provide you with customer service

* complete transactions requested by you

* respond to any questions, problems or complaints, or request feedback

* organize the Site and its various services and activities to better serve you and customize or develop our products and services

* send you emails or other communications containing information about products and services that you have requested 

Personal information provided on our Site may be linked together or merged with other personal information we obtain about you so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about our products or services and those of our business partners. In addition, if we receive personal information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this information with the other personal information we maintain about you. In either case, this Policy governs this information. 

**Disclosure of Information**  
We share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our business. These functions may include, for example, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and processing payment transactions. In all cases we limit the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which is necessary to carry out those functions. 

We also disclose personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, our Site; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay. 

In addition, information about our users, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.

Our Site contains links to other Web sites. Links from our Site to other sites or content are provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the content or privacy and security practices and policies of such third parties or other sites. Any personal information you provide on linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information.
