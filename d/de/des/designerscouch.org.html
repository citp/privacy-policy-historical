DesignersCouch does not collect any other personal information that you do not expressly provide. DesignersCouch  will not sell, rent or share your personal information, including your e-mail address, with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission. DesignersCouch may share your personal information for the purpose of delivering our e-mail to you or as required by law. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, DesignersCouch may need to disclose personal information when required by law and when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process that DesignersCouch receives. We may also collect demographic and other data, which may include Personally Identifiable Information, generally through surveys and forms, which you may or may not choose to participate in.
