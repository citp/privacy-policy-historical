## PRIVACY POLICY

Our Commitment to Privacy

 Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

 The Information We Collect

 This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on this website. The types of personal information collected on the site include:

Name  
Address  
Email address  
Phone  
Billing Information

 The Way We Use Information

 We use the information you provide about yourself in order to respond to communications and fulfill orders. We will not share this information with any third parties at anytime.

As you browse through Designpax and other websites, online ad networks we work with may place anonymous cookies on your computer, and use similar technologies, in order to understand your interests based on your (anonymous) online activities, and thus to tailor more relevant ads to you.   If you do not wish to receive such tailored advertising, you can visit this [page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) to opt out of most companies that engage in such advertising.  (This will not prevent you from seeing ads; the ads simply will not be delivered through these targeting methods.)

 Our Commitment to Data Security

 To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
