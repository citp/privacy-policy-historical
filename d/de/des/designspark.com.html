<h2 id="personal_info">What personal information do we collect?</h2>
<p>When you register with DesignSpark, we ask you to provide your name, e-mail address, a Username and Password, your company and job title. If you choose, you may provide further personal information such as your date of birth, gender and location.&nbsp; You may also choose to post a picture of yourself alongside your profile (Personal Profile).</p>
<p>We may keep copies of information you submit when you send email feedback to DesignSpark or any information exchanged during an online conversation you have with another user, ask a technical question or report a problem. If you contact us in writing, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We also occasionally ask users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes.</p>
<p>Any additional information, content and material you choose to voluntarily post will be visible to all other community members of DesignSpark and staff at RS Components. &nbsp;As any information you post in these areas can be seen by others, you should always be careful when deciding to disclose personal information.</p>
<p>We may also record some details of how you use DesignSpark, such as adverts you click on, products you search for and information you download. If you accessed DesignSpark following a search on the internet, we may record the search you undertook and how it relates to your use of the site. We may, from time to time, supply the owners or operators of third party sites, from which it is possible to link to DesignSpark, with information relating to the number of community members linking to DesignSpark from their sites. You cannot be identified from this information.</p>
<h2 id="protecting_personal_data">What do we do to protect your personal data online?</h2>
<p>Your DesignSpark Personal Profile is password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. You may edit your DesignSpark Personal Profile by using your DesignSpark user name and password and by clicking on the Update My Details button on your home page navigation bar.

<p>We may store some information (known as a "cookie") on your computer when you visit DesignSpark. This information facilitates your use of DesignSpark, and helps us to provide you with the best level of service. We use cookies to ensure that you do not need to re-enter your details every time you visit DesignSpark, and to help us remember your preferred settings, such as font size and screen width.</p>
<p>You can erase or block cookies from your computer if you want to (your help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but certain services may not work correctly, or at all, if you set your browser not to accept cookies.</p>

<h2 id="who_collects_information">Who is collecting information?</h2>
<p>The personal information you provide to DesignSpark is collected by RS Components Ltd and its third party agents.</p>
<p>Please be aware that DesignSpark has links to other sites which may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those web sites linked to DesignSpark are not covered by this privacy statement.</p>
<h2 id="information_sharing">With whom does DesignSpark share my information?</h2>
<p>RS Components Ltd is a member of a world-wide Group of companies of which Electrocomponents plc is the parent company. RS Components Ltd may share information collected about you via DesignSpark with other members of this Group. The members of this Group never sell, rent, or give away information that personally identifies customers to third parties except where elements of the business have been outsourced and the provision of such information is required for the provision of the service to you. Under such circumstances, the security and confidentiality of personal information would form a part of the legal agreement between us and the supplier.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may release aggregated and anonymised marketing statistics to business partners, or may use these in press releases, advertising, or published reports. We would only personally identify you or any other customer in such press releases, advertising, or reports with your prior consent.

In addition, RS Components Ltd may disclose user information when the law requires it.</p>
<h3>Transferring your personal information outside the European Economic Area.</h3>
<p>For purposes of data processing, the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). This may happen if any of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside the EEA, or if one of our service providers is located in a country outside the EEA. We may also need to share information between companies within our group which are located in other countries. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA. If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</p>
<p>In addition, if you use our services while you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with those services.</p>
