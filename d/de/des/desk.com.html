Desk.com is a service of salesforce.com, inc. Desk.com (hereinafter referred to as "Desk" or "Desk.com") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the www.desk.com website and domain names, or otherwise accessing any other linked pages, features, content, products, services or applications offered from time to time by Desk.com in connection therewith (collectively, the "Website"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3>
What does this privacy policy cover?
</h3>
<p class="taller">
This Privacy Policy covers Desk.com's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Desk.com gathers when you access the Website and when you use Desk.com's services or applications. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Desk.com does not own or control, or to individuals that Desk.com does not employ or manage.
</p>
<h3>
What personal information does Desk.com collect?
</h3>
<p class="tall">
The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers:
</p>
<h4>
Personal Information You Provide to Us
</h4>
<p class="tall">
We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about new services.
</p>
<h4>
Personal Information Collected Automatically
</h4>
<ul class="tall">
<li>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services. Desk.com automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.
</li>
<li>
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Desk.com only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Desk.com never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Email Communications
</h4>
<ul class="tall">
<li>
We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Desk.com if your computer supports this type of program. Desk.com uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.
</li>
<li>
When you receive marketing and promotional e-mail from Desk.com, you may opt out of receiving further e-mails of those types by following the included instructions to unsubscribe. Please note, however, that Desk.com may send you administrative and customer service-related email messages for which you may not be given the option to unsubscribe. &nbsp;For example, you may receive messages about your account, the provisioning of requested services, system status update messages, and service and security announcements which are mandatory. If you no longer wish to receive administrative and customer-service-related email messages, you must deactivate your Desk.com account.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Information from Other Sources
</h4>
<p class="tall">
For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to your account information. For instance, as part of the configuration of Desk.com, your account administrator may provide information about you, in order to help you make best use of our system.
</p>
<h4>
What About Cookies?
</h4>
<ul class="taller">
<li>

We use cookies to enhance visitors' experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve the quality of our services.

<li>
Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.
