# Designer Pages: Privacy Policy

Designer Pages Online LLC ("We," "Our," or "the Company") respects the privacy of your personal information and provides the following explanation of how We treat personal information that We collect and receive when you use Our website and services, including any of Our mobile apps, such as the Showrooms app (the "Site" or the "Services"). The type and amount of information We collect about you varies according to how you use Our Services

Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable and that is not otherwise publicly available, such as your address, email address, and phone number. We may collect personal information when you register with Our Site, when you use certain products and Services, when you visit Our Site or the websites of certain third parties, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. For example:

  * When you register on Our Site, We collect and store your email address, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. We may also collect and store information We are able to gather about you through social media and networking websites, including but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Once you register with the Company and sign into Our Services, you are not anonymous to the Company.
  * If you use Our location-enabled Services, We may collect your physical location, including but not limited to your GPS data, in addition to any additional comments and information you may post.
  * We collect information about your interactions with the Company and with some third parties whose information you have viewed through our Site, such as advertisers, manufacturers and showroom owners, including wholesale distributors and retailers ("Third Parties"). We may only share the information We collect about you with such Third Parties in accordance with Section 2.
  * We may combine information about you that We have with information We obtain from Third Parties, social media and networking websites, including but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other companies.



As part of Our Services, We use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. We use web beacons to access Our cookies inside and outside Our Site and in connection with Our Services. We may also use web beacons to determine whether you have visited a link on Our Site. In some instances, We allow other companies that show advertisements on some of Our pages to use their own cookies, which are subject to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before responding to their offers.

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. Further, We limit access to personal information about you to employees who We believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide the Services to you or in order to do their jobs.
