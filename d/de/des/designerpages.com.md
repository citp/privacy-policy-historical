**Introduction**

Designer Pages Online LLC ("We," "Our," or "the Company") respects the privacy of your personal information and provides the following explanation of how We treat personal information that We collect and receive when you use Our website and services, including any of Our mobile apps, such as the Showrooms app (the "Site" or the "Services"). The type and amount of information We collect about you varies according to how you use Our Services. 

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that We do not own or control, or to practices of people that We do not employ or manage. 

**The Type of Information We Collect and Use**

Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable and that is not otherwise publicly available, such as your address, email address, and phone number. We may collect personal information when you register with Our Site, when you use certain products and Services, when you visit Our Site or the websites of certain third parties, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. For example:

We may share the information We collect about you with such Third Parties.

  * We automatically gather general statistical information from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the pages you request. We use this data to determine how much users use parts of Our Site so We can improve Our Site and report this data to Third Parties in the aggregate to provide information on designer behavior trends. We may also use and report individual data, including personally identifiable data, to Third Parties that you interact with using Our Site.

  * We may combine information about you that We have with information We obtain from Third Parties, social media and networking websites, including but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other companies.

**The Way We Use Information**

We generally use information for the following purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, to provide you with the Services, to improve the Services, to contact you, to conduct research, and to provide reporting for Third Parties. In addition: 

  * We provide your name, email address, company and search information to Third Parties. These Third Parties may use your personal information to communicate with you about their offers and offers from Our Company if they choose to do so. 

  * We may use information to resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce the Terms of Service. At times, We may review status or activity of multiple users to do so. We may disclose or access information whenever We believe in good faith that the law so requires or if We otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain and improve Our Services. 

  * We may provide targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. By interacting with or viewing an ad, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. We may provide personal information to an advertiser if you interact with or view a targeted ad.




We may send you certain communications relating to Our Services, such as service announcements and administrative notices. We may also send you Our email newsletter and other communications relevant to the Site. You may unsubscribe to the email newsletter or select certain categories of newsletters you wish to receive from the Company by visiting our Newsletter Preferences page.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

As part of Our Services, We use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you.

We use web beacons to access Our cookies inside and outside Our Site and in connection with Our Services. We may also use web beacons to determine whether you have visited a link on Our Site. In some instances, We allow other companies that show advertisements on some of Our pages to use their own cookies, which are subject to their own privacy policies.
