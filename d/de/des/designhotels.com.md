**3\. Type and scope of data processing**

**3.1       Server log files**

You can browse our website without having to provide any personal data. We only store the following types of access data in so-called server log files, such as:

  * \- your IP address
  * \- the type and version of your Internet browser
  * \- the parts of our website you are browsing
  * \- the referrer website (the website from which you are browsing us)
  *  -the time, date, location, language, screen resolution, flash version, java, and duration of your browsing



The IP address can be regarded as personal data, since, under certain conditions and with additional information provided by the respective Internet service provider, it allows to obtain the identity of the subscriber of the Internet connection. 

The data within the server log files is used by us exclusively to ensure the smooth operation of the website for which we have a legitimate interest in the sense of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Your IP address will be deleted within 26 months.

**3.2       Inquiries by you **

We offer you the opportunity to contact us by email. In this case, we process the personal data you voluntarily provide to us when contacting us which includes at least your email address. We will only process these data for the correspondence with you and for the purpose for which you have given us the data in the course of this communication, such as to contact you at your request. In this case, processing takes place on the basis of your consent in the sense of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. Insofar as processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take, at your request, steps prior to entering into a contract, processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. After completing your request, your data will be erased in compliance with statutory retention periods, unless you have explicitly consented to a further use of your data or we have a right to store your data otherwise.

**4\. For what purposes do we use personal data and on which legal basis do we process?**

**4.1 Mandatory data**

If you want to make a booking through our site or if you want to apply with us, you have to provide certain data within the scope of the contract to be concluded. In any other context, the provision of personal data is neither required by law nor by contract, nor are you required to provide personal information. However, the provision of personal data for the use of our services may also be partially required within the services we provide. In other words, if you do not provide us with the information, we specify to be necessary, we may not be able to provide you with the full scope of services. When you visit our website, we store certain information for administrative and technical reasons.

The e-mail address is required to send you our newsletter, the legal basis for the processing therefore stems from your consent, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. Regarding the other types of data, we have a legitimate interest to document your granting of consent to receive the newsletter in order to be able to prove this in case of doubt, Art. 6 para 1 lit. f) GDPR. In order to obtain your consent, we use the so-called double opt-in procedure, which means that we will only send you a newsletter by email if you have previously explicitly confirmed to us that we should activate your account. After entering your email address into the input mask, we will send you a notification email asking you to confirm that you wish to receive our newsletter by clicking on a link in this email.

  * \- you have been clearly and unequivocally advised when the address is collected and each time it is used that you can object to such use at any time without costs arising by virtue thereof, other than transmission costs pursuant to the basic rates.
