We would also never ask you for your passwords, credit card, phone, etc. We don't even care if you don't give us your real name, to be honest.

We also follow all rules set forth by the [Online Privacy Alliance](http://www.privacyalliance.org/resources/ppguidelines.shtml)

**The Long Version:**

Destructoid.com is committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. The following statement details our ongoing support for the responsible collection and management of Internet user information. 

**Internet User Information  
**   
When we display an advertisement on your computer, we do not collect any personal identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number or email address. Destructoid.com does, like other Internet advertisers, collect certain information which can not personally identify you. (Specifically: Cookies!) This category of information is generally referred to as non-personally-identifiable information includes information like the server or internet service provider you use, type of browser used. There are some cases where you, the Internet user, may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a particular ad (a survey or purchase order form). In such cases the third party advertising with Destructoid.com may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. The advertiser in turn uses this information to reply to your request. 

Furthermore, Destructoid.com does not divulge any information regarding the users who use email for correspondence with the webmaster or any representative of Destructoid.com.

**Online Advertising**

Destructoid does not sell its own ads.  We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads and collect information when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on our Web Site, other web sites and other forms of media about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, check out [http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).  

In layman's terms: it's just a cookie that says "hey you saw this ad already" or "ok, he clicked on a banner ad for leather rock pants, lets show this guy more of those."  We don't share any information from your personal account with advertisers.

**Gaikai Service (The thing that lets you play PC games in the browser on Destructoid):**

(i) Entities that are not affiliated with Associate, such as Gaikai (collectively, “Providers”) may provide certain products and/or services (e.g., the Gaikai Service) on behalf of Associate; and

(ii) Associate may disclose and/or share with Gaikai (as a Provider) certain data and other information regarding visitors’ usage of the Associate Site (collective, “Usage Data”), and/or regarding the individuals who access and use the Gaikai Service and the Licensed Content by means of the Associate Sites, and may allow Gaikai (as a Provider) to collect and use certain Usage Data and other information regarding such individuals, their respective computer system configurations and performance characteristics, and their use of the Gaikai Service and the Licensed Content.

**HEY YOU - USE COMMON SENSE IN ALL YOUR ONLINE ACTIVITIES  
**   
Even the best policy can't protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Unscrupulous advertisers, hackers, and scam artists are constantly searching the Internet looking for new targets. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your on-line activities. 

Be aware that e-mail is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that third parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages, including online greetings. Anytime you visit a chat room or post a message to an on-line bulletin board, your e-mail address can be accessed by advertisers looking to compile lists for unsolicited commercial e-mail (also known as spam).

Be sure that you only disclose your e-mail address in circumstances in which it is safe to do so. Beware of scams in which persons unknown to you request your screen name, password, or credit card information. Make sure you verify the identity of anyone asking for personal information. Always monitor your children's on-line activities and educate them as to the rules for safe Internet use.

Ubisoft has launched a new tactic for netting pre-orders for Assassin's Creed: Unity in the form of a digital slot machine. Pre-order customers gain 5 free spins every Friday, and prizes include everything from in-game content to a trip to Paris. While participants pay no actual money to play, using gambling as a way to attract customers still feels a bit sleazy. [more](http://www.destructoid.com/video-ubisoft-is-now-luring-consumers-into-pre-orders-with-gambling-277087.phtml)
