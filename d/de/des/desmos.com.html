        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Desmos, Inc. ("<b>we</b>" or "<b>Desmos</b>") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. By using the service operated by us and offered through the website located at desmos.com (the "<b>Desmos Site</b>"), you accept and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share information collected on the Desmos Site and through the Desmos online services, including the graphic calculator (collectively, the "<b>Desmos Network</b>"). We provide this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Desmos Network. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the <a href="/terms">Desmos Terms of Use</a>. Your use of the Desmos Network and any personal information you provide on the Desmos Network are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Information Collected By Desmos</b>
    <ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
        <li>User Provided Information: You may provide to Desmos certain information by which someone could personally identify you such as your name, email or unique username ("<b>Personally Identifiable Information</b>"), as well as information about yourself such as your employment or level of schooling by which someone could not personally identify you ("<b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b>") when participating in various activities on the Desmos Network. We will refer to Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information collectively as "<b>Personal Data</b>". In addition to providing us Personal Data directly, if you authorize us to do so, we may access the Personal Data that you have provided third party Internet sites and services (for example, Facebook, Twitter or Google) through the use of an application program interface.
        </li>
        <li>Usage Data: As described in this section, we automatically collect certain information when you use the Desmos Network ("<b>Usage Data</b>"). Usage Data includes the information that your web browser automatically sends to our servers whenever you visit. The Usage Data collected in our server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We send the cookies to your browser when you visit the Desmos Site. We may use Adobe Flash technology which remembers settings, preferences and usage in a manner similar to browser cookies, but which is managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. You can reset your web browser and Adobe Flash Player to refuse all cookies. However, some features of the Desmos Network may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. In addition, the Desmos Network may use third party analytic software (for example, Google Analytics) to collect further Usage Data regarding the online usage patterns of our users. We may combine Usage Data with Personal Data in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user.
    </li></ol>
    </li><li><b>The Way Desmos Uses Information</b></li>
    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
        <li>We may use your Personal Data and Usage Data (together, "<b>User Information</b>") to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Desmos Network and for related business purposes.</li>
        <li>We do not use your email address or other Personally Identifiable Information to send you marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of important Desmos Site changes or for customer service purposes). </li>
        <li>We use your User Information to (a) improve the quality and design of the Desmos Network and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends; (b) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Desmos Network; (c) provide custom, personalized content and information, (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; (e) track your uses of the Desmos Network; and (f) for our other legitimate legal, business, and commercial reasons.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Information That Desmos May Disclose</b></li>
    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
        <li>You may, by using applicable sections of the Desmos Network (including sections which enable you to create graphs), publically share your User Information, including Personally Identifiable Information and graphs that you create. </li>
        <li>At your request, we may provide your User Information to our partners ("<b>Partners</b>") that are integrated with the Desmos Network.  For example: (i) you may publish your graphs to your Facebook and Twitter feed through the use of the Partner's application program interface; (ii) you may provide us feedback, suggestions and bug reports using the customer service software of our Partner, Olark; and (iii) you are or will be able to login to the Desmos Network using Facebook Connect, Twitter Sign-in and similar authentication tools. Any such User Information is provided directly to the Partner and is subject to that Partner's policies, if any, governing privacy and security. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of the Partners. We encourage you to learn about our Partners' privacy and security policies before directing us to provide them with your User Information.</li>
        <li>We share Non-Personally Identifiable Information and Usage Data (such as anonymous user usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with certain third-parties to assist such third parties in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, and/or functionality on the Desmos Network.</li>
        <li>We may release any User Information: (i) if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is in compliance with state and federal laws (including, without limitation, copyright laws) or in response to a court order, subpoena, legal process or search warrant, (ii) if we believe, in good faith, such action is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, exercise our legal rights, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the Desmos Network, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Desmos, our users or others, (iii) to any current or future acquirer, parent company, affiliated entity, joint venture, or other entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy); or (iv) or as described herein.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Your Choices </b></li>
    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
        <li>You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the Desmos Network, in which case Desmos may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your Personal Data and email preferences at any time by visiting your "Edit Account" link.</li>
        <li> Please feel free to contact us with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices using the contact information in Section 11 below.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Our Commitment To Data Security </b><br><br>
Desmos uses physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your User Information. Such safeguards include requesting a unique password to verify your identity before granting access to your account. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of User Information you transmit to Desmos and you do so at your own risk. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times. Once we receive your User Information, Desmos makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems, but please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
    </li>
    <li><b>Children's Privacy</b><br><br> 
Desmos does not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Data on or through the Desmos Network from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of the Desmos Network is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Desmos Network at any time or in any manner. If we learn that Personal Data of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Desmos Network, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information from our systems. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 13 years of age has provided Personal Data to us, then you may alert us at calculator@desmos.com and request that we delete your child's Personal Data from our systems.
    </li>
    <li><b>Special Note to International Users </b><br><br>
The Desmos Network is hosted in the United States and is intended for and directed to users in the United States. If you are accessing the Desmos Network from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that your continued use of the Desmos Network will be governed by United States law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Use. Information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries other than the one in which you reside including countries such as the United States which the European Union has deemed do not provide "adequate" protection for personal information. 
    </li>
    <li><b>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy </b><br><br>
In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users in preparation for or as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, assignment, assumption, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your User Information is treated, transferred, or used, and you consent to the transfer of your User Information to any third party successors or assigns. 
    </li>

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected in the "date last modified" set forth in Section 10 below. If you login to the Desmos Network after an update to this Privacy Policy, we will advise you of the update. Your continued use of the Desmos Network following such update constitutes your agreement to the revised Privacy Policy.
