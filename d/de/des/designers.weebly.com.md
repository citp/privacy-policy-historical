# Weebly Website Builder: Create a Free Website, Store or Blog

### Last updated November 19, 2015

### 1\. What This Privacy Policy Covers

This notice covers how Weebly, Inc., a U.S. company ("Weebly," "we," "us," or "our") treats personal information that it collects and receives from its websites, website hosting services, communication tools, mobile applications, app marketplace, ecommerce tools, and other services (collectively, the “Service”).

We are not in the business of selling personal information about you. We use information shared with us for the purpose of running and improving our Service and in that capacity will operate as a data controller and, to the extent we process data, a data processor.

This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take to protect and secure it, how we use and share information, and finally, how you can contact us with questions or concerns.

Weebly complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Weebly has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Weebly’s certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

### 2\. Information We Collect

**(a) Personal Information.** We collect personal information (e.g., name, email address, phone number, etc.) when you:

  * register an account with us;

**(b) Other User Information.** When you access and use our Service, we automatically collect and store in log files your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, and other user information as part of our Service analytics (individually and collectively, “Automatically Collected Information”). We use mobile application platform permissions when collecting other information from you. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

**(c) Billing Information.** If you sign up for a Weebly Starter, Pro, or Business account, register a domain through us, or purchase another paid service, we require your billing information in order to process the transaction. Billing information includes your name, address, telephone number, credit card details, PayPal email address, and other information necessary to process the transaction.

We will retain the last 4 digits of your credit card number, credit card type, name, address, and some other billing information, so that you may identify that card used in the future. Weebly does not store your full credit card number or CVV2; this information is discarded after your transaction has been processed.

If your subscription is auto-renewing, our authorized payment processor will store your payment information on their secure payment gateway for as long as necessary to carry out the terms of your subscription.

All transactions are processed over an industry standard SSL/TLS connection, with a minimum of 128-bit encryption.

**(d) Cookies and Tracking Technologies.** Cookies, beacons, tags, scripts, and mobile advertising identifiers are technologies used by Weebly and our affiliates, partners, and service providers (such as marketing, analytics, and customer support partners) for analyzing trends, site administration, tracking mobile application installations and users’ movements around our site(s), and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and in an aggregated basis.

**VISITING WEEBLY WITH YOUR BROWSER SET TO ACCEPT COOKIES OR USING OUR MOBILE APPLICATIONS OR OTHER SOFTWARE TELLS US YOU WANT TO USE OUR SERVICE AND YOU CONSENT TO OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE YOU OUR SERVICE.**

We use cookies for a number of purposes, some of which are strictly necessary, including but not limited to our shopping cart, to remember user settings such as language preferences, and for authentication. **You can control the use of certain cookies at the individual browser level.** If you opt-out of such cookies, you may still use our Service, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Service may be limited.

We also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash Cookies and HTML5 technologies to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Service or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity also use LSOs, such as Flash cookies and HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please visit your browser or your operating system preferences.

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Service or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our Service and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

**If you are located in Europe, for more information about targeted advertising or to opt out of having your browser information used for these purposes, please[click here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) or change your cookie preferences on your browser or device settings.
