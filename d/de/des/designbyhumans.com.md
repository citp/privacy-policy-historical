Unique identifiers collect information about a user?s use of our Service on an individual basis.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: We and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser help file directions. Through these cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Service. These Tracking Tools help us learn more about our users and analyze how users use the Service, such as how often users visit our Service, what features they use, what pages they visit, what emails they open, and what other sites or applications they used prior to and after visited the Service. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of the Site may not work properly or at all.

Third-Party Widgets: Some parts of our Services may contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter "Tweet" button, or the Facebook "Like" button. These widgets and features collect your IP address, the page you are visiting, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

Upon disposal, we will destroy or render unreadable any such Personal Data. Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.
