We may in the future also share this information with Third Party Service Providers and Third Party Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming. 

Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web Site utilizes standard technology called "cookies" and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web Site is used. Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the use~s hard drive.

2) Automatic Logging of Session Data

We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data", that is anonymous and not linked to any personal information. Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on our Website. An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. Although such information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP), and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.

3) Cookies 

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to do such things as run programs on your computer, plant viruses or harvest your personal information. The use of cookies is very common on the Internet and the DesiDime use of cookies is similar to that of Yahoo!, CNN.com and other reputable companies. No personal information about you is gathered or stored in the cookies placed by the DesiDime web site and, as a result, none can be passed on to any third parties.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. By changing the options on your web browser or using certain software programs, you can control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your browser. DesiDime understands and supports your right to block any unwanted Internet activity, especially that of unscrupulous websites. However, blocking DesiDime cookies may disable certain features on our site and may make it impossible to use certain services available on the site.
