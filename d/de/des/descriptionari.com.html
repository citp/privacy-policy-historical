<p>Service Provider uses your user name and password to grant you access to and use of the Websites. Your e-mail address will be used, at your request, to send you a copy of your user name and password. If you provide personally identifiable information, it will be used to provide you with the service you have requested. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.</p>
<p>We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. And if you choose to purchase items through features on the Websites, we may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment. There are also times when you provide information about yourself to us in areas of the site that may be managed or participated in by third parties, such as auction services or shopping areas. In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies), each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests.
