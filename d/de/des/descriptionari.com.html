<h2>Our Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. You can access the Privacy Policy any time at http://descriptionari.com/our/privacypolicy. Your use of and/or registration on any aspect of the Websites will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you cannot agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Websites. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including without limitation offline and on sites linked to from the Websites.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our <a href="/our/terms/">Terms and Conditions</a>. Your use of the Websites constitutes agreement to its terms and conditions as well.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page, so check back often. Continued access of the Websites by you will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>The Type of Information the Websites Collects</h3>
<p>The Websites generally collect personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our publication(s), or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested.</p>
<p>Our servers may also automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the Websites, including without limitation the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your IP address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university.</p>
<h3>How the Websites Use Information Provided by You</h3>
<p>Service Provider uses your user name and password to grant you access to and use of the Websites. Your e-mail address will be used, at your request, to send you a copy of your user name and password. If you provide personally identifiable information, it will be used to provide you with the service you have requested. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.</p>
<p>We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. And if you choose to purchase items through features on the Websites, we may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment. There are also times when you provide information about yourself to us in areas of the site that may be managed or participated in by third parties, such as auction services or shopping areas. In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies), each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. While Service Provider will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, Service Provider does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. We may also provide access to our database in order to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings, including, for example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process.</p>
<p>In addition, we reserve the right to use the information we collect about your computer, which may at times be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad demographic information, and to otherwise administer our Websites.</p>
<p>While your personally identifying information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.</p>
<p>In addition, as our business changes, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by Service Provider, its parent or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, the information from and/or about our website users may be among the transferred assets.</p>
