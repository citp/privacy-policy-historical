This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Descript, Inc. (“us”, “we”, or “our”) when you use and access our Descript media editing and transcription tool, which includes the Descript App for Mac, Windows, and Web (the “App”), the Descript website (the “Site”), and all related tools and services (collectively, the “Descript Service”).  


We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Descript Service to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.  


### Collection of Information

 _Information You Provide to Us_. We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you create an account with Descript, fill out a form, create a project, upload content, request support, send us an email, or otherwise communicate or interact with us. The types of information we collect may include your name, email address, postal address, password, demographic information, voice, image, and other information you choose to provide. _Information We Collect Automatically_. When You Use the Descript Service. When you access or use the Descript Service, we may automatically collect information about you, including:  


  *  _Log Information_ : We log information about your use of the Descript Service, including how you use the App, the type of browser you use, browser language, access times, pages viewed, duration of time for which you viewed a page, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to the Descript Service.

  *  _Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies_ : We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that helps us to better understand how the Descript Service is used and improve the Descript Service and your experience. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in the Descript Service or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see “Your Choices” below.  





### Collection of Information

We may use information we collect from you for various purposes, including to:  


  * Provide, maintain, test, and improve the Descript Service and our technology;  


  * Provide and deliver the services you request, and the services we provide to users of the Descript Service, and to process transactions and send you related information, including confirmations and invoices,  


  * Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages;  


  * Respond to your comments, questions and requests and provide customer service;  


  * Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards, and events offered by us and others, and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you;  


  * Monitor and analyze trends, usage, performance, and activities in connection with the Descript Service;  


  * Detect, investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities and protect our rights and property;  


  * Personalize and improve the Descript Service and for research and development purposes;  


  * Link or combine with information we get from others to help understand your needs and provide you with better service; and  


  * Carry out the purposes for which the information was specifically collected or for which you provided consent.  





 _Note with Respect to the Use of Project Information_ : Notwithstanding the foregoing, we protect the information contained in the Projects you create using the Descript Service (the “Projects’) as Confidential Information, and limit our use thereof, in accordance with the confidentiality obligations set forth in our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms). The Descript Service automatically processes your Projects, but it does not involve human access to your Projects unless: 1) you provide your consent (e.g., for the purpose of providing customer support); 2) you request our White Glove transcription service – which uses humans (who are subject to confidentiality obligations) to create the transcriptions; or 3) we are required to do so by law. If you use our White Glove Service or provide opt-in consent, we may also use your Projects to analyze and improve the quality of our service and our technology. If you provide us your consent and later change your mind, you are free to withdraw your consent at any time by emailing us at [support@descript.com](mailto:support@descript.com).  


Transfer of Information to the U.S. and Other Countries  


Descript is based in the United States and we process and store information in the U.S. Therefore, we and our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.  


### Collection of Information

As a general rule, we do not disclose your information to third parties. However, in certain limited circumstances, as described in this privacy policy, we need to do so to run our business and to comply with legal requirements. Remember that there is no human access to your Projects, except as explicitly described above, and any sharing is subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in our Terms of Service.  
We may share information as follows:  


  * With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf, including, but not limited to, third-party payment processors and vendors who assist us in providing, developing, testing and improving the Descript Service and our technology;  


  * In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;  


  * If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of us or others;  


  * In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company (provided that your Projects will remain subject to the confidentiality obligations); and  


  * With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through the Descript Service or otherwise that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you choose to provide such information.  





We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you. Please note that any Projects that are designated as “public” or any other information you post in a public area of the Descript Service may be publicly viewable, including any information about you that may be contained in such Project, and will no longer be treated as confidential.

These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Descript Service and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Descript Service and other websites and better understand your online activity.
