We take your privacy seriously.

We never sell, exchanges, or release your personal information (name, e-mail address, or billing information). Your information is not shared with any other third party or company outside of billing and shipping purposes.

Generally, this information includes name and e-mail address for registration to receive our free newsletters and name, postal address, and credit card information when purchasing our products. All of this information is provided to us by you. This information is used for internal purposes only.

We only contact individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the event that they have signed up to receive our free newsletters or have purchased one of our products. We collect personally identifying information from our users during online registration for our newsletters and during purchasing of products and services.

We use cookies help track a person’s session while online. By showing how and when our visitors use this site, this information can help us to continue to improve our site. The use of cookies is also used to ensure accuracy of our affiliate program. Cookies are stored on your computer and not on this site. If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, you may set your web browser to do so, if your browser permits.

Your email information is stored at the list server that delivers the newsletters. That information can only be accessed by those who help manage those lists in order to deliver e-mail to those who would like to receive the newsletters.

All of our newsletters sent out include an unsubscribe link in them. You can remove yourself at any time from our newsletters by clicking on the unsubscribe link. You can also contact us at mail@thesocialman.com to change your information at any time.

This policy may be changed at any time at our discretion. If we should update this policy, we will post the updates to this page on our Website.
