<h4>Information Collection and Use by Us</h4>
<p>We are the sole owner of information collected on the Sites (including any metadata), except for contact lists and content that you provide to us in connection with your use of our products and services. We collect information only as necessary to fulfill the purposes set forth in this privacy statement and we will only use this information as described in this privacy statement. We may combine any or all of this data with other information we collect about you.</p>
<p>In connection with your use of our products or services, we will obtain contact lists (including email addresses and other information for your subscribers) and content (including the content of your campaigns and storefront information) that you provide to us in connection with such use. We acknowledge your ownership rights in such contact lists and content. We will never sell or rent your contact lists to anyone without your permission and will never use your contact lists or content for any purpose other than as described here.</p>
<p>We may use any of this information to offer and improve our products and services, to provide you with requested information or technical support, to facilitate your movement through the Sites or your use of our products and services, to do a better job of advertising and marketing our products and services, to diagnose problems with our servers or our products and services, in connection with our security and compliance programs, to administer our Sites, to communicate with you, to target prospective customers with our products or services, to assist us in offering you a personalized experience or otherwise tailor our Sites, product and service offerings to you, or as otherwise described in this privacy statement. We may aggregate and anonymize information received to produce reports on trends and statistics, such as mobile search trends, email open rates by industry, campaign best practices or the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, our Sites or evaluated or purchased our products and services. Payment information that you provide to us, including credit card data, will only be used to facilitate payment for our products and services. We may also use recorded telephone conversations for quality control purposes, to train our employees and for our own protection.

<h4>Tracking Technologies</h4>
<p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and our partners (including marketing partners and affiliates) as well as our analytics and other service providers.

<p>Notwithstanding our efforts, we cannot guarantee absolute or unqualified protection of this information given the open nature and resulting instability of the Internet and World Wide Web, and we make no representations or warranties as to the effectiveness of our security and assume no liability for security breaches or any failure in the security of your computer equipment, your internet service provider or other networks and communications providers.</p>

<h4 id="sharing" class="type-style-3">Sharing of Information</h4>
<p>We will only share certain personal information with our partners, third party service providers and co-marketing partners, an acquirer, with others within your organization, our affiliates (including other members of the Endurance corporate family) and for legal reasons, as more fully described below.</p>
<p>We may share your name, email address and other information with certain of our partners so that they may assist you in using our products and services, contact you with offers, services or products that may be of interest to you, and provide you with their products or services. Our partners are prohibited from using your contact information for any other purpose without your consent. We will not provide our partners with your credit card information. If you are working with a partner and would like that partner to have full access to your account, we will provide access to just that partner upon your request or consent.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we enter into contracts with carefully selected third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, providing customer service, fraud detection and deterrence or access to advertising assets), to assist us in our own marketing and advertising activities or to engage in co-marketing activities with us. Our contracts with such third parties prohibit them from using any of your personal information for any purpose beyond the purpose for which it was shared.</p>
<p>We may also share non-personal information with any third party, including the media, industry observers, marketing and advertising partners, vendors, customers, potential customers or partners. For example, we may disclose mobile search trends, email open rates by industry, campaign best practices or the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, our Sites or evaluated or purchased our products and services.</p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets, or other similar sale transaction, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you by email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such transfer and any choices you may have regarding your information.</p>
<p>We may share your information with others within your organization (including any affiliates or any other individuals designated as users on your account). We may also share your personal information with any of our affiliates (including other members of the Endurance corporate family). Any such affiliate may use your information only according to the terms of this privacy statement.</p>
<p>Lastly, we may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement authorities and other relevant third parties, such as internet service providers, when such disclosure is necessary or advisable, in our sole discretion, to conduct an investigation, respond to a third party or law enforcement subpoena or court order, bring legal action, prevent harm to others or pursue other relief when you or a third party are or may be: violating our terms and conditions of use; causing injury or other harm to, or otherwise violating our property or other legal rights, or those of other users or third parties; or violating federal, state, local, or other applicable law. This disclosure may include transferring information to the U.S. and outside the European Economic Area. To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties in connection with a subpoena.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.constantcontact.com/legal/anti-spam" target="_blank">Our Anti-Spam Policy</a> tolerates only permission-based email. You always have the opportunity to opt-out of our marketing communications with you or change preferences by following a link in the footer of all non-transactional email messages sent by us or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@constantcontact.com" rel="nofollow">privacy@constantcontact.com</a>.

<p>If you do not wish to have your personal information shared with third parties for co-marketing purposes, you may do so at any time by opting out of all marketing communications with us.</p>
<p>Some communications (for example, important account notifications and billing information) are considered transactional and are necessary for all of our trialers and customers. You must cancel your Constant Contact or SinglePlatform account, as applicable, to unsubscribe from these communications. To cancel your Constant Contact or SinglePlatform accounts, please see "Access to Personal Information" below. You may still receive marketing communications from us even after you cancel your account unless you also opt-out of our marketing communications, as described above.</p>
<p>To manage the information we receive about you from a social networking site or any other third party, you will need to follow the instructions from that party for updating your information and changing your privacy settings. The information we collect is covered by this privacy statement and the information the third party collects is subject to such third party's privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on any third party site will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our Sites.</p>
<p>If an account or profile was created without your knowledge or authorization, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@constantcontact.com" rel="nofollow">privacy@constantcontact.com</a> to request removal of the account or profile.</p>
