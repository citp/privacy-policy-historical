**privacy**

designboom recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all   
information provided by users of our web site, subscribers to our on-line   
education and events, recipients of our e-mail newsletter, participants of   
our competitions and all of our customers. we created this policy with a   
fundamental respect for our users’ right to privacy and to guide our   
relationships with our users.

**signing up  
**for certain selected services (such as free newsletter subscriptions,   
competitions, on-line education courses),  
users must first register.  
recipients of our newsletter can unsubscribe using the instructions   
listed at the end of the e-mail newsletter.  
for our services that require payment (such as certain events, products   
and subscriptions), we do not receive and do not collect credit card information.

**during registration  
**we ask for contact information.  
newsletter subscribers are required to give only their e-mail address,   
participants of on-line education courses, competitions and special events   
are asked to give also their name, age, gender and mailing address.

**designboom collects information  
**from our website users, subscribers and customers for internal purposes.  
we use this information to communicate with users and provide requested services.   
we also collect the data for internal (and for business affiliates)   
audit verification purposes. we do not sell this data to third parties.

**communications with us  
**we have features where users can submit information to us.  
letters to the editor and similar submissions may be made public.  
requests for service, support or information may be forwarded as needed   
to best respond to a specific request.

**with whome your information is shared  
**when we have co-branded, or when we join with other parties to provide   
specific services (such as events, competitions), we may share (provide   
and receive) personal information with them.  
other than as set forth above, we do not share personally identifiable   
information with other companies.

**security**  
we use reasonable precautions to protect our users' personal information   
and to store it securely. the servers on which we store personally   
identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
