			<h3>Last updated November 19, 2015</h3>				

			<h3>1. What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
			<p>This notice covers how Weebly, Inc., a U.S. company ("Weebly," "we," "us," or "our") treats personal information that it collects and receives from its websites, website hosting services, communication tools, mobile applications, app marketplace, ecommerce tools, and other services (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

			<p>We are not in the business of selling personal information about you.  We use information shared with us for the purpose of running and improving our Service and in that capacity will operate as a data controller and, to the extent we process data, a data processor.</p>

			<p>This notice tells you what information we collect, steps we take to protect and secure it, how we use and share information, and finally, how you can contact us with questions or concerns.</p>

			<p>Weebly complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Weebly has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Weebly’s certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>

			<h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
			<p><strong>(a) Personal Information.</strong>  We collect personal information (e.g., name, email address, phone number, etc.) when you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>register an account with us;
				</li><li>contact our customer support services;</li>
				<li>sign-up as, or are invited to be, a member of a Pro or Business account user’s site;</li>
				<li>are referred to us through our “invite a friend” referral feature;</li>
				<li>enter our promotions, contests, or sweepstakes;</li>
				<li>post content on a Weebly website or blog;</li>
				<li>sign-up to be an App Developer; and</li>
				<li>post an App review in our App Marketplace</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>(b) Other User Information.</strong> When you access and use our Service, we automatically collect and store in log files your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, and other user information as part of our Service analytics (individually and collectively, “Automatically Collected Information”). We use mobile application platform permissions when collecting other information from you. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.</p>

			<p><strong>(c) Billing Information.</strong> If you sign up for a Weebly Starter, Pro, or Business account, register a domain through us, or purchase another paid service, we require your billing information in order to process the transaction.  Billing information includes your name, address, telephone number, credit card details, PayPal email address, and other information necessary to process the transaction.</p>

			<p>We will retain the last 4 digits of your credit card number, credit card type, name, address, and some other billing information, so that you may identify that card used in the future. Weebly does not store your full credit card number or CVV2; this information is discarded after your transaction has been processed.</p>

			<p>If your subscription is auto-renewing, our authorized payment processor will store your payment information on their secure payment gateway for as long as necessary to carry out the terms of your subscription.</p>

			<p>All transactions are processed over an industry standard SSL/TLS connection, with a minimum of 128-bit encryption.</p>

			<p><strong>(d) Cookies and Tracking Technologies.</strong> Cookies, beacons, tags, scripts, and mobile advertising identifiers are technologies used by Weebly and our affiliates, partners, and service providers (such as marketing, analytics, and customer support partners) for analyzing trends, site administration, tracking mobile application installations and users’ movements around our site(s), and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and in an aggregated basis.</p>

			<p><strong>VISITING WEEBLY WITH YOUR BROWSER SET TO ACCEPT COOKIES OR USING OUR MOBILE APPLICATIONS OR OTHER SOFTWARE TELLS US YOU WANT TO USE OUR SERVICE AND YOU CONSENT TO OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE YOU OUR SERVICE.</strong></p>

			<p>We use cookies for a number of purposes, some of which are strictly necessary, including but not limited to our shopping cart, to remember user settings such as language preferences, and for authentication. <strong>You can control the use of certain cookies at the individual browser level.</strong> If you opt-out of such cookies, you may still use our Service, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Service may be limited.</p>

			<p>We also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash Cookies and HTML5 technologies to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Service or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity also use LSOs, such as Flash cookies and HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please visit your browser or your operating system preferences.</p>

			<p>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Service or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our Service and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.</p>

			<p><strong>If you are located in Europe, for more information about targeted advertising or to opt out of having your browser information used for these purposes, please <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">click here</a> or change your cookie preferences on your browser or device settings. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.</strong></p>

			<p><strong>(e) Third Party Analytics Services.</strong> Some parts of our Service use third party analytic services to help us create a better user experience.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Flurry. You can opt-out of Flurry’s mobile analytics service at <a href="http://www.flurry.com/legal-privacy/end-user-opt-out">Flurry Opt-Out</a>. The opt-out is specific to Flurry activities and does not affect the activities of other ad networks or analytics providers we may use.  When you opt-out, Flurry will stop tracking data for the device identified by the provided MAC address and/or device identifier going forward and Flurry analytics tracking will stop across all applications within the Flurry network.</li>

				<li>Google. For the web, visit the <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics opt-out page</a> and install the add-on for your specific browser.  For our mobile applications, you can opt-out using our “Privacy Opt-Out” settings within our applications.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>(f) Do Not Track.</strong>  Currently, we do not support Do Not Track or “DNT.” DNT is a preference you set in your web browser to tell visited websites you do not want to be tracked.  You can enable or disable DNT through the preferences or settings of your web browser.</p>
			<h3>3. Legal Ability to Enter Into Contracts</h3>
			<p>You are prohibited from creating or using a Weebly account if you are not legally capable of entering into contracts, for example, if you are not the age of majority in your country or region.  If you are not the age of majority in your country or region, you may only create or use a Weebly account with the supervision and consent of a parent or guardian or alternatively through a special student account created by a teacher through education.weebly.com, provided the teacher has obtained signed consent from your parent or guardian.   

			</p><h3>4. Information Use, Sharing, Disclosure, and Retention</h3>

			<p>(a) Use.  Weebly uses information for providing products and services, identification and authentication, Service operation, analytics and improvements, support, contact (e.g., sending notifications related to use of the Service), research, and anonymous reporting.

Global document changes to update disclosures on information collection, use, and sharing, the app marketplace, and Cookie-related information.  Sections 2(d) and 3 were added to address analytics services and Do Not Track, respectively.</p>
