<!-- start: shared_blocks.130732555#below-paragraph-1 -->


<!-- end: shared_blocks.130732555#below-paragraph-1 -->
<h2>1. Your Privacy<br></h2>
<p>We recognize that your privacy is important. 
This document outlines the types of personal information we receive and collect 
when you use Desktop-Video-Guide.com, as well as some of the steps we take to 
safeguard information. We hope this will help you make an informed decision 
about sharing personal information with us.<br>
<br>
Desktop-Video-Guide.com strives to maintain the highest standards of decency, 
fairness and integrity in all our operations. Likewise, we are dedicated to 
protecting our customers', consumers' and online visitors' privacy on our 
website.</p>
<h2>2. Personal Information</h2>
<p>Desktop-Video-Guide.com collects personally 
identifiable information from the visitors to our website only on a voluntary 
basis. Personal information collected on a voluntary basis may include name, 
postal address, email address, company name and telephone number.<br>
<br>
This information is collected if you request information from us, and sign up to 
join our email list or request some other service or information from us. The 
information collected is internally reviewed, used to improve the content of our 
website, notify our visitors of updates, and respond to visitor inquiries.<br>
<br>
Once information is reviewed, it is discarded or stored in our files. If we make 
material changes in the collection of personally identifiable information we 
will inform you by placing a notice on our site. Personal information received 
from any visitor will be used only for internal purposes and will not be sold or 
provided to third parties.</p>
<h2>3. Use Of Cookies And Web Beacons<br></h2>
<p>We may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. Cookies are 
identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your Web 
browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of a cookie 
is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For 
example, if you personalize the sites pages, or register with any of our site's 
services, a cookie enables Desktop-Video-Guide.com to recall your specific information on 
subsequent visits.<br>
<br>
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your Web browser; 
however, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully 
experience the interactive features of the site.<br>
<br>
A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey around a 
single website or collection of sites. They are also referred to as web bugs and 
are commonly used by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic. 
They may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact 
with the pages and content on the pages of a web site.<br>
<br>
We may serve third-party advertisements that use cookies and web beacons in the 
course of ads being served on our web site to ascertain how many times you've 
seen an advertisement. No personally identifiable information you give us is 
provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so they cannot personally 
identify you with that information on our web site.<br>
<br>
Some third-party advertisements may be provided by Google, which uses cookies to 
serve ads on this site. Google uses the DART cookie, which enables it to serve 
ads to our users based on their visits to this site and other sites on the Web. 
You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the
<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">Google ad and 
content network privacy policy</a>.<br>
<br>
Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is 
being sent. Privacy software can be used to override web beacons. Taking either 
of these actions shouldn't cause a problem with our site, should you so choose.</p>
<h2>4. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act<br></h2>
<p>This website is directed to adults; it is not directed to children under the age 
of 13. We operate our site in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy 
Protection Act, and will not knowingly collect or use personal information from 
anyone under 13 years of age.</p>
<h2>5. Non-Personal Information</h2>
<p>In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally 
identifiable. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, 
to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the 
site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. The 
information collected is used solely for internal review and not shared with 
other organizations for commercial purposes.</p>
<h2>6. Release Of Information<br></h2>
<p>If Desktop-Video-Guide.com is sold, the information we have obtained from you 
through your voluntary participation in our site may transfer to the new owner 
as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may 
continue. In that event, you will receive notice through our website of that 
change in control and practices, and we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the purchaser honors any opt-out requests 
you might make of us.</p>
<h2>7. How You Can Correct or Remove Information<br></h2>
