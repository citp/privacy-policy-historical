# Privacy Policy | Desiring God

We greatly value the trust you place in us. The personal information you provide to us will not be given to or shared with anyone outside of Desiring God unless you explicitly allow it, or we believe that it is necessary to comply with the law, protect the safety of any person, or to address fraud, security or technical issues.

## Website

The personal information we collect about you on our website, desiringGod.org, is strictly limited to the information you provide us when you contribute, register, contact us, or sign up for an mailing list.

### Online Contributions

When you make a contribution on our website, the personal information you provide to us is protected using SSL encryption, which protects sensitive data transmissions from your computer to our website. With SSL encryption, the information you enter is encrypted at your browser, then sent over the Internet in encrypted form, and finally de-encrypted when it reaches us at our server. As a visitor to our website, you should be able to see when the SSL encryption is active by the “padlock” icon in your browser's window.

### Usage Tracking

We track the way people use our website and our apps. The information we collect is not personally identifiable, and is targeted to things like how often our website is visited and the types of web browsers visitors are using. As part of this process, we place so-called “cookies” (small electronic ID tags) on the hard drives of visitors. Cookies do not provide us with any personal information about you. You may choose to reject cookies and still use much of our entire website, although some aspects of our website may be disabled.

### Amazon.com Disclosure

Desiring God is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

### Children's Online Privacy

We never knowingly collect or maintain information on our website from visitors we know are under the age of 13.

## Mailing Lists

We do not sell, license, or share our mailing lists (email and physical) with other organizations. We do not mail you on behalf of or at the request of other organizations. When you sign up for one of our mailing lists, we only send you information pertaining to our ministry and as initiated by Desiring God.

If you still receive emails several days after completing this form and want to be removed, please contact us at mail@desiringGod.org.

If you want to remove your name from our physical mailing list, please contact us at mail@desiringGod.org.

## Changes

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version will always be posted here at desiringGod.org/privacy-policy. By continuing to access or use any aspect of a Desiring God website, app, or service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
