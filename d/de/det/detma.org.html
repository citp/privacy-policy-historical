This is the Web site of the Massachusetts Division of Employment and Training (DET). Your privacy is one of our top priorities. The following policy applies only to the use of the DET Web site. Other Web sites operated by other Massachusetts state agencies have different policies. We strongly suggest that you read the privacy policies for each Commonwealth Web site that you visit, and any external site that you visit through a link appearing at this site. </font> </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial" size="2">
A Privacy Partnership </font></p>
</b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Your privacy with respect to the use of this Web site results from a partnership between DET and you, the user.  At this Web site, we attempt to protect your privacy to the maximum extent possible. However, because some of the information that we receive through this Web site is subject to the
<a href="http://www.state.ma.us/legis/laws/mgl/66-10.htm">Public Records Law (Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 66, Section 10</a>), we cannot ensure absolute privacy. Some information that you provide to us through this site may be made available to members of the public under that law. This policy informs you of the information that we collect from you at this site, what we do with it, to whom it may be disseminated, and how you can access it. Based on this information, you can make an informed choice about your use of this site. You can maximize the benefits of your privacy partnership with DET by making informed choices about whether to share personally identifiable information with us through this site.</font></p>

<b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="personal"></a>Personally Identifiable Information </font></p>
</b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">When you send an e-mail through this Web site, that e-mail will automatically contain some personally identifiable information.  We use the term "personally identifiable information" to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, Social Security number, employer business identification number, birth date, bank account information, credit card information, or any combination of information that could be used to identify you.  The only personally identifiable information collected by this site would be as a result of an e-mail you send.
<a href="#top">top</a> </font></p>

<b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="your_privacy"></a>Your Privacy and E-mails</font></p>
</b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">DET asks that you do not use e-mail to send information that you consider to be confidential.  E-mail is not secure and may be intercepted by a third party.  If your communication relates to service you have received from DET, is highly sensitive or includes personal information such as your Social Security number or business identification number, we suggest that you call DET or send your message by regular mail. We recognize this creates constraints and regret any inconvenience. DET will be adopting a secure method of Internet communication in the near future. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">In order to maintain your confidentiality, DET will respond by e-mail only to questions of general interest.  We will contact you by telephone or regular mail to respond to inquiries about your unemployment insurance claim, employment situation, or business.
<a href="#top">top</a> </font></p>

<b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="information_collected"></a>Information Automatically Collected and Stored by this Site</font></p>
</b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">This Web site does not use "cookies."   Cookies are files or small pieces of information that some Web sites place on computers to track your activity on the site or to recognize you when you return to the site. </font> </p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">However, MassStats – our on-line interactive economic data system – does use a temporary connector.  This is necessary because MassStats is designed to allow desktop users to query a central DET database and receive immediate response to those queries at their desktops.  In order to know where to send responses to your queries, we must be temporarily connected to your personal computer. </font> </p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">This connection exists only during the time that you are using
MassStats.  It contains no personal data, is not stored in any way by DET’s Web site, nor can it be retrieved by
DET.  Once you stop using MassStats, or turn off your computer, the connection disappears. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you choose not to accept this connection, all sections of the DET Web site will still be fully functional, except for MassStats. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Some of the forms posted on the DET Web site do include text boxes that allow you to complete the forms on-line.  These forms, however, cannot be transmitted electronically to DET and this site does not capture any of the information you place on the form. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">This site does collect and store indefinitely your
<a href="#IP">Internet Protocol ("IP") address</a>, which does not identify you as an individual, as well as information about the date and time of your visit, and the DET Web site pages visited. We use your IP address to assess the frequency of visits to this site and the popularity of its various pages and functions. We will not attempt to match any personally identifiable information that you provide to us with your IP address, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that doing so would provide information that is relevant and material to a criminal investigation.

<b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="confidentiality"></a>Confidentiality at DET and the Dissemination of Personally Identifiable Information</font></p>
</b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">DET takes seriously its role in protecting the privacy of our customers.  Claimants, job seekers, and employers who do business with DET are protected by strict rules of confidentiality.  The laws requiring this confidentiality are the<u> <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/legis/laws/mgl/151a-46.htm"> Massachusetts Employment and Training Law
</a> </u>(Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 151A, Section 46) and <u><a href="http://www.state.ma.us/legis/laws/mgl/23-9l.htm">Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 23, Section 9L</a></u> under which DET administers its programs. </font>
  </p>

<b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">This means that information held by DET – on individual unemployment insurance claims, job seekers using DET and One-Stop Career Center services, and Massachusetts employers covered by the Massachusetts unemployment insurance law – is confidential and cannot be divulged without the permission of the parties, except under very specific circumstances. </font>
  </p>

</b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Information that you voluntarily submit through an e-mail to this Web site may be shared with DET employees or officials, but only with those authorized employees with a "need to know" for purposes of fulfilling their job responsibilities. Those DET staff members will use the information solely to answer your questions, respond to any requests for assistance, and fulfill our obligations.  Any of these e-mails may be retained as a record of service provided or may be archived. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">DET will not disclose any personal or business information we obtain to third parties, unless one of the following limited exceptions applies:<br>
 </font>
</p>



<ul>
<li>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">DET may furnish your personal information (provided, for example, when you apply for unemployment benefits in person or by telephone) to other government agencies if required by state or federal law. </font>
 </p></li></ul>



<ul>
<li>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Where appropriate, we may provide the information submitted by you to the person or company that is the subject of your inquiry, or to a government agency responsible for the matters referred to in your communication. </font>
</p></li></ul>


<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You should still be aware, however, that once you voluntarily submit personally identifiable information to us through an e-mail – and that information does not pertain to a claim for unemployment insurance benefits, an employer’s unemployment insurance tax account or job search activities provided by DET or career center staff – its dissemination is governed by: </font>

 <font face="Arial" size="2">Because of these laws, DET may be required to provide all or part of the information you send us by e-mail – information that is not covered by the laws governing confidentiality at DET – to a member of the public in response to a public records request.</font>

<b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="security"></a>Security</font></p>

E-mail is not secure and may be intercepted by a third party.

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">We use standard security measures to ensure that any personally identifiable information is not lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally destroyed. We also use software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. </font>

<a href="http://www.state.ma.us/consumer/New/privexeco.htm">Executive Order 412</a>, which enhanced the privacy protection given to any information about you as a named individual held by the Executive Department of state government.
Executive Order 412 limits the collection and dissemination of personally identifiable information within the Executive Department. This site complies with Executive Order 412, so all of the personally identifiable information that you submit to this site is given the privacy protections set forth in
Executive Order 412. <a href="#top">top</a></font></p>
