Any data we collect is stored in a MySQL database on a dedicated server.

Only myself (Andy) and certified admin staff with our hosting partner have administrative access to the server.

This server is powered by [Dell hardware](http://www.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/servers/server-poweredge-r710/pd.aspx?refid=server-poweredge-r710&cs=555&s=biz "Dell server") hosted in the UK by [Rackspace](http://rackspace.co.uk/ "Rackspace") and protected by [Cisco FireWall](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6120/index.html "Cisco Firewall").

Data we store is also backed up to a physical tape drive, again with [Rackspace](http://rackspace.co.uk/ "Rackspace") in London.

Your data will never be left on a bus or train, not by us anyway!
