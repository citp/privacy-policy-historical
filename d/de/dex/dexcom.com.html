                    <p><strong>PRIVACY PRACTICES SPECIFIC TO PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION</strong></p>
                    <p>Please note that DexCom will handle any personal health  information which you provide to it, through the Site or otherwise, in  accordance the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, a  federal privacy law commonly referred to as “HIPAA” or the “HIPAA Privacy  Rules.” For more information on how DexCom handles your personal health  information, please refer to our <a href="privacy_practices.html">Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND WHEN?</strong><br>
                      <br>
                          <u>Personally Identifiable  Information</u><br>
                          <em>When  you register</em> with the Site we collect your name, email address, telephone  number, and additional contact information.&nbsp;  We also collect a website username and password.</p>
                    <p><em>When  you make purchases at the online store on the Site</em> we collect your credit  card information, billing and shipping addresses, and other  transaction-specific information, such as the kinds and quantities of products  that you have purchased.&nbsp; We may in the  future collect information regarding your health insurance coverage in order to  assist you and other of our customers in obtaining reimbursement from health  insurers for the purchase of DexCom products.</p>
                    <p><em>When  you send email</em> through the Site, we collect your screen name and email  address, as well as any additional information you include in the message.</p>
                    <p><em>When  you’re navigating the Site</em> we record your IP address.</p>
                    <p>We consider each of the above  pieces of information to be “Personally Identifiable Information” because it is  individually identifiable information about you.</p>
                    <u>Other Information Associable with You<br>
                    </u><em>When  you’re navigating the Site</em> we log various information to help manage and  improve our Site, to provide additional services, and for sales and marketing,  in general and for you in particular. For example, we identify items such as  domains and browser types to understand how our Site is used and to report  these statistics in the aggregate to the vendors that manage the technology of  our website. We also record any information you enter, such as search terms. <strong></strong>
                    <p><u>Cookies,  etc.&nbsp; </u><br>
  Like many websites, we use  “cookies,” 1-pixel gifs (spotlight tags), JavaScript code, and other standard  web technology to collect information for our own use.&nbsp; A “cookie” is a small data file that we  transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.&nbsp; You can instruct your browser, by editing  its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a  cookie and to permit you to refuse it.&nbsp;  In most cases you can refuse a cookie and still navigate our Site,  though it may disable some features. Check with the maker of your browser for more  information about how to control cookies.</p>
                    <p>Cookies make it easier for you to  register with and use the Site and for us to offer opt-in and opt-out  opportunities, and they enable us to follow your navigation through the Site  and customize it to your interests.&nbsp;  Cookies allow us to remember your identity and preferences so we can  display content appropriate for you and your interests.</p>
                    <p><strong>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE  INFORMATION?</strong></p>
                    <p>                      We use your personally identifiable  information (and at times other information we collect) to: </p>
                    <ul type="disc">
  <li>Authenticate your visits to the Site; </li>
  <li>Fulfill orders that you place through the online       store on the Site; </li>
  <li>Send you important information regarding products you       have purchased and/or use; </li>
  <li>Help us respond to email inquiries and questions to       our call center; </li>
  <li>Help us better market and provide our products and       services and the products and services of our affiliates. </li>
</ul>
<p>We also use the information to  manage and improve our Site content and notify you about changes or improvements  to our Site.</p>
<p>Unless you have opted-out of receiving  marketing information, such as email updates regarding new products, we may use  your personal information to customize and deliver that information to  you.&nbsp; However, we will not sell your  personally identifiable information to any outside company for marketing or  solicitation.</p>
<p>We may also enhance or merge  personal information collected through the Site with data we collect from  through other channels or receive from third parties in order to better market  our products and services and serve your needs.</p>
<p><strong>LIMITED DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL  INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<p>We do share non-public, personally  identifiable information with our affiliates.&nbsp;  We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to  unaffiliated third parties, but only as follows. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>To vendors that help us fulfill orders for our       products and/or deliver product information, publications, or other       reference materials. </li>
  <li>To advertising and marketing agencies to help sell       and market our own products and services.</li>
  <li>To technology and other service providers to provide       technology and services to us.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure  that the above unaffiliated third parties keep your information confidential  and to not use the information for any purpose other than providing services to  us and to you under our direction.</p>
<p>We also disclose such information  as permitted or required by law or as required by subpoena, search warrant or  other legal process.</p>
<p>As our business evolves, we may sell,  transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including information  provided by you, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of some  or all of our assets, or in the event of bankruptcy.&nbsp; In any such event, personally identifiable and other information  may be one of the assets transferred.</p>
