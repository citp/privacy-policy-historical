  Revised May 18, 2005<br>
</span></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0;"><span class="style3">L</span>ike you, we at Dex Media, Inc. (“Dex Media”) are concerned about the privacy of our customers and the users of Dex Media’s web sites, including <a href="http://www.dexmedia.com" class="bodylink">www.dexmedia.com</a>, <a href="http://www.dexonline.com" class="bodylink">www.dexonline.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.dexpages.com" class="bodylink">www.dexpages.com</a>. We are proud of our history of maintaining the privacy of information we obtain in the course of providing our services and we remain sensitive to privacy issues.&nbsp; As a repository of listing information, we are committed to establishing fair and coherent policies concerning issues such as name sourcing, commercial use of listing information, deleting listings, controlling e-mail access, and so on. This Privacy Policy covers these and other issues. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy">This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date posted.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy is subject to change and the use of information that we gather now is subject to this Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use.&nbsp; You should check this web site frequently to see recent changes. Notice of any changes to this Privacy Policy shall be given by posting the version of the Privacy Policy containing such changes on this web site. </p>
      <p class="headerblue style4" style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Information We Obtain From Your Use of this Site and How We Use It</p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span class="bodybold">Generic Information</span> - To gauge the effectiveness of this web site, we collect certain non-individually-identifiable generic information about visitors of this web site. Our web servers automatically recognize a visitor's Internet service provider, the IP address, the domain name, the type of browser, and the operating system, as well as which pages are viewed on this web site, the web page from which a visitor entered this web site, how much time a visitor spends on each page, and other information related to the operation and interaction of this web site. This information does not reveal a visitor's identity (for more information, <a href="#cookies" class="bodylink">see “Cookies” below</a>). We aggregate this information and use these statistics to evaluate and improve this web site, to monitor its performance, and to make this web site easier for you and other visitors to use. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span class="bodybold">Identifiable Information </span>- You may choose to provide individually-identifiable information to Dex Media when using this site in a number of ways – such as by ordering a service from us, sending us e-mail, registering to receive news or information, applying for a job, entering a contest, completing a survey or other channel tactics.&nbsp; When you supply information about yourself when using this web site for a specific purpose, Dex Media uses this information for that purpose (such as to provide the information you have requested or to consider you when you apply for a particular job). In addition, when you use this web site, we may use the individually-identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained off-line - for example, to evaluate your needs and contact you regarding our services.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span class="bodybold">Other Information</span> - You may choose to provide us with individually-identifiable information to customize a personal home page. We use this information to better understand and serve our advertising customers, but we do not share that information outside of Dex Media.&nbsp; This information may be compiled on an aggregated basis and shared with our customers or business partners, but the user will be anonymous.&nbsp; We may, at times, conduct surveys (online or via telephone research) in which you may choose to participate, and we may collect information resulting from such survey.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span class="bodybold">Online</span> - Dex Media places banner ads and links on the web sites of third parties. When we do this, we collect non-individually-identifiable information through the aid of third parties with whom we contract, using browsing technology. This activity allows us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the web site and helps us target our Internet advertisements. The information collected is anonymous and does not contain any information that would personally identify the user. The information is shared among our contracting agents and our business operations in order to assess the results of a search. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span class="bodybold">Surveys </span>- We may offer you an opportunity to participate in a survey regarding your experience with this web site. You are under no obligation to respond to any survey. Information collected by Dex Media when you participate in a survey may include your full name, e-mail address, and street address and may be aggregated and used to evaluate and improve this web site.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span class="bodybold">Children</span> - Dex Media does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age through this web site, nor does Dex Media target its online services to children under 13 years of age. However, this web site may contain links to third party content providers that collect such information. These third parties are expected to comply with all laws pertaining to the collection of information from children. Because the Internet offers open access to a wide range of information, it is important that parents supervise and prevent access to inappropriate content, e-mail or chat sessions.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="bodybold">Additional Uses</span> - We may also use information in our records to protect our customers, employees or property - for instance, to investigate fraud, harassment or other types of unlawful service activities involving Dex Media or other companies that we do business with. In some cases, it may be necessary to provide this information to the government or third parties who make a lawful demand for it. Dex Media may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to Dex Media’s interests (such as customer fraud) or whose activities could bring harm to others. </p>
      <p class="headerblue style4" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Copyright </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;">If you believe that your work has been copied and is accessible on this web site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may notify Dex Media through its <span class="bodylink"><a href="copyright.html" class="bodylink">Copyright Complaint Procedure</a></span>. </p>
      <p class="headerblue style4" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Sharing of Information </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span class="bodybold">User Information </span>- We share user information described above within our company to enable us to better understand the needs of our customers and the users of this web site, and to learn how to best design, develop, and package products and services to meet those needs. Like any large business, we may structure our company to include a number of smaller or "sister" companies. Currently, our primary business includes directory publishing services (in various forms, including over the Internet), direct marketing services, and dedicated web hosting services.&nbsp; Sometimes Dex Media co-sponsors events with another company, such as sweepstakes or promotional give-a-ways. In these instances, if you provide individually-identifiable information it likely will be used by both Dex Media and the co-sponsor.&nbsp; We treat information we collect online similarly to that we collect off-line. We do not sell or disclose individually-identifiable information obtained online to non-Dex Media entities except as described above (when Dex Media is in a business relationship with an unaffiliated party and then under confidentiality restrictions) unless you specifically authorize it; disclosure is required by law (including the service of subpoenas or court orders in either civil or criminal lawsuits); or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property. In addition, we may share aggregated or statistical information with others. Examples of this include the number of users who searched for a particular advertisement, advertiser or customer listing, the length of their visit, who used certain word(s) when performing a search or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Finally, Dex Media may support features and content that appears on other companies' web sites that you may visit. These companies may collect information about you, but Dex Media does not have control over the collection practices of these companies.&nbsp; You are advised to read the privacy policy of each such web site for its policies regarding information collection and usage. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="bodybold">Customer Information</span> - As a general rule, Dex Media does not release its customer account information to unaffiliated third parties without your permission, unless we have a business relationship with those companies where the disclosure is appropriate. For example, we may hire outside companies as contractors or agents, or we might be engaged in a joint venture or partnership with another company. From time to time, Dex Media may decide to stop providing a service or may decide to sell or transfer parts of its business to unaffiliated third parties. When this happens, we may provide confidential customer information to these companies so that they can offer you the same or similar services. In all of these situations, we provide information to these other companies only as needed to accomplish our business objectives, and such companies are bound by requirements to keep Dex Media’s customer information confidential. There are exceptions to the general rule. For example, we might provide information to regulatory or administrative agencies so that they can accomplish their regulatory tasks (for example, responding to a customer complaint) or to maximize the efficiencies of our own processes (for example, getting mailing addresses correct). Other disclosures will be driven by legal requirements imposed on Dex Media.&nbsp; For example, Dex Media complies with "legal process" requests, such as subpoenas, court orders or other similar demands associated with either criminal or civil legal proceedings. If a Customer instructs us in writing to release its account information to someone, we will honor the customer request and provide that information.&nbsp; We may provide account information to collection agencies when customers do not pay their bills. We restrict the use that can be made of this information to collection activities only for our billing charges.</p>
      <p class="headerblue style4" style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Information We Hold</p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span class="bodybold">Advertiser and Listing Information</span> - Dex Media publishes and distributes directories in print, on the Internet and on CD-ROMs.&nbsp; Some directories are complimentary and some are provided for a fee.&nbsp; These directories include customer names, addresses and telephone numbers, without restriction to their use.&nbsp; The listing information we obtain is licensed to Dex Media from Qwest Corporation (“Qwest”) or may be obtained by Dex Media from other publicly-available sources and is generally necessary for us to publish listing information, publish advertising and/or design new services. While we are prohibited from making any changes to the information that Qwest provides, we will assist you in advising Qwest on how to arrange for any desired listing changes. Name, address and telephone information in directories is not legally protected by copyrights and may be sorted, packaged, repackaged and made available again in different formats by anyone, including Dex Media.&nbsp; For example, we need to know telephone subscribers' names, address and telephone numbers to provide listings in the Dex Media White Pages directories. When a customer calls us, our representative’s pull up account records and may refer to the customer’s current directory listing. If you are one of our customers, our representatives may refer to your advertising order and other information we have to answer questions you may have so that we can best serve you.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="bodybold">Other Information </span>– Non-published numbers, non-listed numbers and “omit addresses” are classes of information that Dex Media will not knowingly accept to be published in its directory products or compiled with our direct marketing lists. Dex Media will include, where required, “No Solicitation” codes by listings within our publications.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="headerblue style4" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Disclosure of Information </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span class="bodybold">Telephone Numbers, Name and Address</span> - Telephone number, name and sometimes address information is "released" or "published" by Dex Media in different ways. It is sometimes released as "lists" to entities that are entitled by law to receive the information or which have entered into contracts with Dex Media to receive it. Sometimes the information is provided in reports to those persons who are being called by you and want to know more about who is calling them and when. Whether a number is recognized as "published" or not will generally depend on the medium by which the number is captured and released by the local telephone carrier for whom we publish directories. For example, persons may ask their local telephone carrier to include them in the relevant directory (that is "publish" their number) or to exclude them from such directory. In addition, persons may ask not to be published in the relevant directory but to be included in Directory Assistance (i.e., have a “non-listed” number).&nbsp; Persons may also ask not to be included either in the relevant directory or Directory Assistance (i.e., to be “non-published”). All of these terms refer to a "listing" status. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span class="bodybold">Publishing </span>- Telephone carriers are required to provide listed customer names, addresses and telephone numbers to directory publishers such as Dex Media.&nbsp; We may publish this information in alphabetical or reverse directories that take the form of paper directories, electronic directories over the Internet, CDs, DVDs, or other formats. We also use this information to allow for directory deliveries and for certain third party marketing services such as product promotion ride-alongs which accompany a directory delivery. We might provide a listing address containing name and address to administrative agencies where we are working with them to minimize costs and maximize accuracy. For example, we might share this information with the U.S. Postal Service so that we may continue to qualify for reduced postage rates and you can get your bills and other information from us in a cost-efficient, reliable and timely fashion. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="bodybold">Lists</span> - We also compile and disclose the published information (described in “Publishing” above) in the form of lists containing names, addresses and telephone numbers of the type printed in the Dex Media White Pages directories and provide these lists to qualified companies that are conducting product promotions. Non-published and non-listed numbers are not included in these lists.&nbsp;&nbsp; We honor requests to have names removed from these lists. Individuals with listed information who do not wish to have their name included on such lists should inform us and we will remove such information.</p>
      <p class="headerblue style4" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Our Communication</p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><span class="bodybold">Communication by Telephone </span>- We may contact you and our customers with information about new products and services or special promotions. However, Dex Media does maintain an internal "Do Not Call" list in line with federal law. We honor the various state "Do Not Call List" requirements when marketing our products and services. As a member in good standing of the Direct Marketing Association, Dex Media is committed to observe all of the Association's privacy requirements and will remove any customer's name from our direct marketing list products upon request passed to us either by the Association or by the listed party directly. Such requests may take a reasonable time to process, so names on these lists may be contacted while such removal is in process.&nbsp; Often those laws permit continued contact with persons whose numbers are on the list when there is an existing business relationship, so our customers might get a call from us even if a customer is on these kinds of lists. Communication by Direct Mail - It is Dex Media's practice to stop sending direct mail materials to individuals who request it not be sent. There are no laws that control this accommodation, but we respect the desire of individuals to be free of such communications if they wish. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="bodybold">Communication by E-mail </span>- We may use e-mail to communicate with you and our customers about events, new products and services, or to respond to visitor's e-mails. If you receive unwanted e-mail from us, you can remove yourself from our e-mail list simply by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in the e-mail. We will not send commercial solicitations to our customers who request that such solicitations not be sent. Please note that if you do go through this process, some e-mail messages may still come to you, although not those dealing with commercial solicitations. For example, we may e-mail you about viruses, or changes to your service, or other types of product advisories. </p>
      <p class="headerblue style4" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="cookies"></a>Cookies</p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;">This web site may use "cookies" to improve our level of service and speed up the delivery of information to visitors of this web site. Cookies are lines of text that are transmitted to your web browser when you click on a web site. This data string contains your unique user ID for this web site. Cookies provide a way for a server to recall a previous request or previous registration, or to keep track of a transaction as it progresses, so that information does not have to be repeated. Your browser stores the information on your hard drive and when you return to this web site later, the cookie is transmitted back only to the servers that originally sent it to you. You can configure your browser to notify you when you are about to receive a cookie; at that time you will have the option of refusing the cookie. You can check your hard drive for cookie files according to your browser or system instructions. </p>
      <p class="headerblue style4" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Links</p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;">Advertisers that serve ads on this web site may also contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices employed by third party web site. Other web sites may have different privacy policies or no policy. Users should review the privacy policies of any web site before providing personal information.&nbsp; These other web sites may use their own cookies. These cookies collect their own information independent of Dex Media. You disable this cookie capability as described above.&nbsp; Dex Media may present links in a format that enables it to understand and improve the quality of the search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results. </p>
      <p class="headerblue style4" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Security</p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">We have information systems that collect and store customer information, in addition to systems that store our own business records. These systems have different types of security as appropriate for the information stored. Dex requires employees to keep customer information confidential and we hold them accountable for their actions.&nbsp; Dex Media has databases and systems that are maintained to reasonably secure all of Dex Media's commercial information, including information about its customers. All credit card and bank account information you submit is encrypted through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software. We transmit the entire credit card number or bank information to the appropriate financial institution during processing.</p></td>
