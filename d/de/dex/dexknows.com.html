This privacy policy outlines the information R. H.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other activities of the Company. 
        </p>
      <p class="bodycopy"><strong class="headerblue">B. Internet Privacy and Information Collected</strong>
          <br>
  We respect your right to privacy. We do not collect personally identifiable information (for example your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) about you from the Site unless you voluntarily provide it to us. During your visit to the Site, we will collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your usage of the Site. We use this information to monitor Site usage, enhance the Site and as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy or on the Site. You may visit the Site without providing any personally identifiable information. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy"><span class="headerblue"><strong>C. Personal Information</strong></span><strong><br>
      </strong>When you provide personal information for a specific purpose, we generally use it for that purpose. Examples of personal information you may be asked to provide include your name, age, e-mail address, phone number, zip code, mailing address or mother's maiden name. We may also use your personally identifiable information in a manner similar to when we obtain such information in a non-electronic manner. For example, we may use this information to evaluate your service needs or contact you regarding promotions, announcements, surveys, contests, and additional services that we may provide. We may also use this information in a compilation to share with our customers or business partners, but the specific user will be anonymous. Additionally, any personal information that you provide may be aggregated and used to evaluate and improve this Site. <span class="headerblue"></span></p>
      <p class="bodycopy">          <span class="headerblue"><strong>D. Information Shared With Third Parties</strong></span><strong><br>
      </strong>  Unless otherwise stated at the time of collection, we do not generally sell or disclose personally identifiable information provided to us to any third parties (other than business partners of the Company and third party vendors retained by the Company) unless you specifically authorize the disclosure, disclosure is necessary to provide service to you, or disclosure is required by law or for the safety of others. We may also use this information to protect our customers, employees or property – for instance, to investigate fraud, harassment or other types of unlawful service activities involving the Company or other companies that we do business with. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Please note that when you provide personally identifiable information to us in connection with a transaction or event that we sponsor with a third party, you may also be providing that information to the third party. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of the third party. <br>
        <br>
  We may share non-personally identifiable information with business partners and other third parties to evaluate or enhance the Site. Such information may include, for example, the number of visitors to the Site and the specific pages visited. Non-personally identifiable information may also be disclosed if it is required by law or for the safety of others. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong class="headerblue">E. Links to Third Party Sites</strong><br>
  Our Site includes links to or frames of Web sites of third parties. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices employed by third party Web sites. Other Web sites may have different privacy policies or no privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policies of any Web site before providing personal information. You should note that we may host Web site advertising that is linked to the Site. If you provide any personally identifiable information while visiting any Web site advertising that is hosted by us, you will also be providing the personally identifiable information to the advertiser. If you provide any personally identifiable information while visiting any third party Web site that is linked from or framed by the Site, you will be providing the personally identifiable information to the third party owner of that site. <br>
  <br>
  Please note that we may share personally and non-personally identifiable information collected from any Web site advertising we host on behalf of an advertiser with third parties in order to complete a transaction that you initiated, provide you services or evaluate the hosted Web site. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy"><strong>  <span class="headerblue">F. Opting Out; Questions About the Policy</span> <br>
      </strong>If you do not want us to contact you via e-mail, you can remove your name from our e-mail solicitation lists by clicking on Contact Us. All concerns or questions about your privacy related to online advertising should be addressed through our Privacy Policy administration, which can also be reached by clicking on Contact Us. <span class="headerblue"><br>
      <br>
      <strong>G. Communications with Users of the Site</strong></span><strong> <br>
      </strong>We may contact you and our customers by telephone, direct mail or e-mail to conduct online surveys, provide information on new products and services, or inform you of special promotions. If you receive an e-mail from us that you do not wish to receive, you may click on Contact Us and ask us to remove you from our list. Please note that if you do remove yourself from our e-mail list, some e-mail messages may still come to you, although not those dealing with commercial solicitations. For example, we may e-mail you about viruses, or changes to your service, or other types of product advisories.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="headerblue"><strong>H. <a name="cookies"></a>Cookies</strong></span><strong><br>
      </strong>
  We may use “cookies” to collect IP addresses and information regarding your usage of the Site. A cookie is a small file that is stored on the hard drive of your computer that is available for future access when you return to the Site. We use cookies to monitor your online activity and provide better service to you. <br>
  <br>
  Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, please note that some Web sites may be able to track your usage after cookie deletion if you come back to the same site or a related site and provide personal information. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="headerblue"><strong>I. Security</strong></span><strong><br>
  </strong>RHD is committed to protecting the security of users personal information, including when it is transmitted online. We have information systems that collect and store customer information, in addition to systems that store our own business records. These systems have different types of security as appropriate for the information stored. Our databases and systems are maintained to reasonably secure the Company's commercial information, including information about its customers. All credit card and bank account information you submit is encrypted through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which is evidenced by the Website address at the top of your browser changing from “http” to ‘https”. We transmit the entire credit card number or bank information to the appropriate financial institution during processing.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="headerblue"><strong>J. </strong><strong>Children</strong></span><strong> <br>
</strong>We recognize the importance of the safety and privacy of children on the Internet. Due to these issues and in order to comply with certain laws, we do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. It is important for parents to supervise and prevent access to inappropriate content, e-mail or chat sessions. Children should ask their parents or guardians for permission before disclosing any information on the Site. <br>
<br> 
<span class="headerblue"><strong>K. Contests</strong></span><strong><br>
</strong>We may offer contests for which we may collect personal information (such as name, age, city and state). If you participate in the contest or send us a question we may also ask for an e-mail address. If we know a visitor is under the age of 13, we will require the child give us a parent or guardian e-mail address, so that we can tell the parent or guardian that the child is registered in a contest. If we need more than an e-mail address and first name for the child to participate in the contest, we will notify the parent or guardian, explain what information we need and why we need it, and generally ask that the parent or guardian (not child) provide it. Any information the parent or guardian (or child) gives us in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our database once the contest or program is complete, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete. No one will be excluded from the Site for not giving us this information. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy" style="margin-bottom: 0">          <strong class="headerblue">L. Privacy Policy Updates </strong><br>
        We may amend this privacy policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes to this policy, we will make an announcement on the Site. </p>      </td>
