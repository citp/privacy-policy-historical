# DeLorme | Privacy Statement

DeLorme Privacy Statement  
DeLorme's goal is to completely satisfy our customers with products and services of the highest value. Information you provide us online can help us to meet your needs and exceed your expectations. At the same time, we have a deep respect for personal privacy and wish to use such information only for your benefit. 

This statement explains our practices concerning the collection and use of customer information. Practices may change over time as we consider new technologies and customer needs. Any changes will be posted here. However, our desire to satisfy you and maintain your trust will never change.

This Privacy Statement explains the following:

  * What information we collect online
  * What types of information we do not collect
  * How we use the information we collect
  * How we use e-mail
  * Children's Privacy
  * How you can update your preferences
  * How to contact us



What information we collect online  
We require only the information needed to process your order or register your product. Items for these purposes are indicated by red asterisks on the entry forms. Some forms might also request optional information such as e-mail address or individual preferences.

By choosing to provide requested optional information, you allow us to provide more effective technical support, surveys or subsequent product notices and information that we believe will be of value to you.

What types of information we do not collect  
Unless you place an order, register a product or use a service provided by the DeLorme Web site, DeLorme does not collect or know your name or e-mail address. DeLorme does not follow your browsing activity outside of our site.

In order to continually improve our Web site, we do study how people use it, and which areas are popular and more meaningful. We may collect aggregate information site-wide, including site usage statistics and transaction information. We log domain names and/or IP addresses. Please keep in mind that such information is analyzed only in aggregate and is not personally identifiable.

How we use the information we collect  
We use required information, as the case may be, to process your order or to register your DeLorme purchases so that we can provide appropriate support. Customer information also contributes to the development of new or improved products or services.

If you provide your e-mail, postal address or phone number, we may use them to communicate with you, but we will not do so [if you don't want us to](https://web.archive.org/web/20021204222658id_/http%3A//www.delorme.com/preferences.asp).

DeLorme greatly values you as a customer and respects your interest in your personal information. We are not in the practice of selling or renting names or other identifying information to outside parties. Yet, there may be occasional opportunities or needs to share information with carefully selected partners. This may or may not involve their communicating with you. In any case, our partners are not permitted to provide this information to another party. DeLorme considers such relationships only if we truly believe in their benefit to our customers and our products; however [if you do not wish to be included, please let us know](https://web.archive.org/web/20021204222658id_/http%3A//www.delorme.com/preferences.asp).

How we use e-mail  
DeLorme e-mails your online order confirmation to you. We occasionally send e-mail notices of upgrades, special offers and new product announcements. We may also solicit your input on new products or feedback on existing ones. You may remove your name from our e-mail list at any time by following the "Unsubscribe" instructions at the bottom of any e-mail message from us. You will continue to receive e-mail order confirmations.

Children's Privacy  
DeLorme does not knowingly collect or use information from persons under 13 years of age. All registrations, purchases, and requests for information by anyone under 13 must be submitted by the parent or guardian. DeLorme will not share information with selected partners (as described above) regarding customers of any of its products that are likely to be used by young children unless the registrant submits such a preference.

How you can update your preferences  
You may update your preferences at any time by filling out our [Preferences form](https://web.archive.org/web/20021204222658id_/http%3A//www.delorme.com/preferences.asp).
