### Privacy Fundamentals: Privacy Matters   
at Deluxe

Long before laws that protect the privacy of certain kinds of information and long before terms like "identity theft" were commonly known, Deluxe Corporation was a trusted custodian of sensitive customer information. For decades, financial institutions and customers have relied on Deluxe as a caretaker of information such as checking account numbers, routing numbers, addresses, credit card numbers, telephone numbers, social security numbers, drivers' license numbers and many other pieces of information considered confidential.

Today that information is known as non-public personal information and it is the center of attention for financial institutions and businesses, like Deluxe that deal with this type of information on a daily basis. Under laws known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, data security and breach regulations, non-public personal information must be protected. At Deluxe, we've been protecting this kind of information since the company was founded in 1915.

Our business depends on our ability to meet the privacy needs of the industry and of the people who use Deluxe products for financial transactions every day. No matter where an employee works at Deluxe, privacy matters.

  * **Manufacturing** — Every day thousands of checks and related product orders are fulfilled. Each order has confidential information included, so Deluxe focuses on making sure that information is secure, and appropriately disposed of, when necessary
  * **Customer Care** — Our associates interact with our clients and customers every day. We take steps to ensure that all points of contact including phone, e-mail, electronic, or standard mail are secure, and confidential information is used and handled according to company policy and applicable law.
  * **Sales & Marketing** — Deluxe has established procedures to ensure that each employee knows how to handle and protect confidential information. Deluxe takes responsibility to follow industry guidelines for privacy protection practices, ensure accuracy in direct marketing, and meet customer preferences regarding the collection and usage of confidential information
  * **Corporate** — Whether it's resolving a problem or managing a client relationship, corporate employees have the training and tools to recognize confidential information and how to make sure it is secure, and remains confidential



###  Deluxe's Commitment to Privacy

Throughout our existence, Deluxe Corporation ("Deluxe") has been a trusted custodian of sensitive consumer data. Financial services companies and consumers rely on that trust. The operating subsidiaries of Deluxe created a formal privacy policy in 1997 to ensure that the clients and customers of Deluxe understand our commitment to protecting customer privacy.

It's good business practice for companies today to be clear about how they use customer information. Also, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions and other businesses to have established privacy policies, readily accessible to customers to understand how their information is collected, used, protected, and shared.
