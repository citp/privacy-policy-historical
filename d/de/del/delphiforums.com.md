# Delphi.com - Privacy Policy

**Registration**  
Some basic personal information is required in order to register with Delphi.com: 

  * **Name** \- Your first and last name help us to personalize your online experience. For example, your "My Forums" list of favorite online communities may feature your first and/or last name. This information is only visible to you - Delphi.com will not disclose your first or last name to any person, or to any third party without your permission. 
  * **Email Address** \- By providing your email address, you can receive important messages via your existing email account. Message board notifications, personalized My Forums newsletters, and messages sent to by other Delphi.com members rely on the email address you provide when you register. The ability to turn off email correspondence from Delphi.com is also under your direct control, as is the ability to change the email address that is associated with your user name. Delphi.com will not disclose your email address to any person, or to any third party without your permission. 
  * **User Name** \- This is how you are identified when you participate in forums. While many other aspects of your account can be updated regularly, your user name cannot be changed.

  
**Information Delphi.com Requests**  
  
When you register, you are asked to give demographic information (like ZIP code, birth year, occupation, and gender). You are not required to provide this information. We ask you to tell us a little about yourself so we can better understand the types of people who register. That information can also be used to provide you with content that may be of interest to you, and to show you advertisements that are relevant to your demographic information. Similar to television, radio, and magazines, Delphi.com relies primarily on revenue from advertising to subsidize the cost of providing you with free services. To help enhance the relevance and effectiveness of ads, Delphi.com provides advertisers demographic information on an aggregate basis (not linked to your personal name or email address). For example, Delphi.com may report to advertisers that "45% of users are female and the average age is 28." Delphi.com uses outside ad companies to display ads on its sites. These ads may contain cookies. While Delphi.com uses cookies in other parts of its sites, the ad companies also use cookies with the ads displayed, and Delphi.com may not have access to this information.   
  
**Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act**  
  
Any data—except email address—that Delphi.com collects on children under 13 years of age will be discarded in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Email addresses of children under 13 submitted during registration are kept by Delphi.com for identification purposes only, and under no circumstances are displayed or made publicly available.   
  
**Participation**  
The above describes information that is provided "actively" - meaning, you choose to submit this information to us when you join Delphi.com, or update your account at any point after having joined. Some other information is provided "passively" - meaning, that Delphi.com obtains this information when you login to your Delphi.com account and use the service. This is done primarily through the use of "cookies." Cookies are used on Delphi.com to verify your login information, and to optionally store your password in your browser so that you do not need to type it in each time you visit Delphi.com. Any time that you point your browser to a 'members-only' area, Delphi.com checks your browser's cookie file to see if you have already logged in, and if you have, you're taken right to the page that you have requested. If not, you'll be directed to the Delphi.com login screen, where you can quickly and easily login to your account, or signup for Delphi.com if you are not yet a member. Cookies are also used in conjunction with some ad banners to determine their effectiveness. (Delphi.com works with a third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about how Flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please go to [ http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html](http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html).)   
**Cookies**  
  
A cookie is a small text file that many Web sites write through your browser when you visit them. A cookie can only be read by the site that places it, so Delphi.com can't "see where you've been" based on any other cookies in your browser. Netscape Navigator uses a single file called "cookies.txt" to record all cookies, and you can open this file in any text editor to see what it looks like. On a Macintosh computer, the Netscape cookie file is called "MagicCookie". Internet Explorer uses a separate file for each cookie, which typically reside in "C:\Windows\Profiles\User\Cookies." Much controversy and myth has been spread about cookies, specifically that cookies "read or write information on your computer's hard drive, and are therefore evil", or "cookies can find out where I live and what my email address is." To learn the truth about cookies, and to help to dispel this misinformation, please visit:

Delphi.com: [Interactive Glossary of Internet Terms](http://www.delphi.com/navnet/glossary/c.html#cookie)

Cookies are generally supported in version 3.0 and newer of Internet Explorer, 2.02 and newer of Netscape, and 3.0 and newer of AOL. Most browsers also allow the option of displaying a warning before accepting a cookie, or refusing all cookies. Declining cookies while participating in forums may result in some of features not working properly.   
  
**Delphi.com & Non-Delphi.com Forums **  
  
Delphi.com, along with many other companies, relies on Prospero Technologies to host our online communities and related data. Participation in a given company's forums includes the sharing of some of your personal information with both Prospero and the company that operates the forum. You will be warned before your information is shared with another company, and will have the opportunity to decline if desired. Any company with which your information is shared will have it's own privacy policy. 

As a registered user, you may receive email messages on a regular basis to keep you apprised of your membership status and inform you of new services available to you. Examples of this include the personalized 'My Forums' email, which shows you an overview of activity in your favorite online communities. If you create your own online community, we will also email you traffic summary reports for your own forum on a regular basis. Included in each of these messages are simple instructions on how to remove yourself from these mailings if you do not wish to receive them in the future.   
  
**Public Forums**  
  
Delphi.com hosts message boards, chat and other services for both public and private forums. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in public forums becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.   
  
**Security**  
  
Delphi.com's site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control. Delphi.com's servers have strict security in place to prevent an intruder from retrieving personal information about its users.   
  
**Personal Information/Opt-out**  
  
Delphi.com gives users the ability to change their personal information by going to <http://www.delphi.com/my-forums> . Delphi.com provides users the opportunity to opt out of receiving mailings from Delphi.com by replying with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line. Any user having difficulty unsubscribing should contact [postmaster@delphi.com](mailto:postmaster@delphi.com).   
  
**Termination**  
  
You can elect to terminate your membership with Delphi.com at any time, by sending email to [service@delphi.com](mailto:service@delphi.com). Be sure to include your membername and/or Email Address in the body of your message, so that we can easily identify your account. Upon termination, your account information will _not_ necessarily be removed entirely from Delphi.com - this is to reserve your identity so that no one else can create a new account with your membername or email address, and also allows you the privilege of reactivating your account at a later date if you wish to use Delphi.com again. The termination of your Delphi.com membership will not automatically terminate any affiliated memberships or registrations you have formed through Delphi.com. If, after having joined a Delphi.com partner's service, you wish to be removed, you should contact that service directly to have your membership terminated.   
  
**Summary**  
  
In this electronic era, when personal information can easily be obtained through various sources, Delphi.com appreciates the sensitivity of any private information that you disclose to us. It is our intention to treat your account information with the highest level of care. If you have further questions about our practices and policies with regard to how your account information is treated, please contact [service@delphi.com](mailto:service@delphi.com) at any time.
