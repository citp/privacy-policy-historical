      Cookies are used on Delphi Forums to verify your login information, and
      to optionally store your password in your browser so that you do not need
      to type it in each time you visit. Any time that you point your browser
      to a 'members-only' area, Delphi Forums checks your browser's cookie file
      to see if you have already logged in, and if you have, you're taken right
      to the page that you have requested. If not, you'll be directed to the
      Delphi Forums login screen, where you can quickly and easily login to your
      account, or signup for Delphi Forums if you are not yet a member. Cookies
      are also used in conjunction with some ad banners to determine their effectiveness.
