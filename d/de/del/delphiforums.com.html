            need to type it in each time you visit. Any time that you

            you have, you're taken right to the page that you have requested.

            can quickly and easily login to your account, or signup for Delphi Forums 
            if you are not yet a member. Cookies are also used in conjunction 
            with some ad banners to determine their effectiveness.

              through your browser when you visit them. A cookie can only be read 
              by the site that places it, so Delphi Forums can't "see where you've 
              been" based on any other cookies in your browser. Cookies are generally 
              supported in version 3.0 and newer of Internet Explorer, 2.02 and 
              newer of Netscape, and 3.0 and newer of AOL. Netscape Navigator 
              uses a single file called "cookies.txt" to record all cookies, and 
              you can open this file in any text editor to see what it looks like. 
              On a Macintosh computer, the Netscape cookie file is called "MagicCookie". 
              Internet Explorer uses a separate file for each cookie, which typically 
              reside in "C:\Windows\Profiles\User\Cookies." Most browsers also 
              allow the option of displaying a warning before accepting a cookie, 
              or refusing all cookies. Declining cookies while participating in 
              forums may result in some of features not working properly.
