We may also collect certain information from the browser you used to come to our website, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, access times, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the website that referred you to our website and to which URL you browse away from our site if you click on a link on our site.

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Dell, information collected through one source may be combined with information obtained through other Dell resources. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other parties.

Some Dell services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Dell and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services, and may use the information according to each company's privacy statement and other agreements with you.

How We Use Personal Information

Dell uses your personal information to:

  * Deliver the services and support, or carry out, the transactions you have requested;
  * Send communications to you, such as product safety information, your transactions status (for examples, order confirmations) , information about products and services available from Dell and its corporate affiliates, saved cart reminders, promotional offers, and surveys;
  * Customize, analyse, and improve our products, services (including the content and advertisements on our website), technologies, communications and relationship with you;
  * Enforce our conditions of sale, website terms and/or separate contracts (if applicable) with you;

Personal information collected may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Dell or its corporate affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using Dell products and services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

Disclosing Personal Information

We may share your personal information with corporate affiliates to carry out transactions you request or to make our business or that of our corporate affiliates more responsive to your needs.

In addition, we may share your personal information with business partners that help Dell carry out transactions you request or that help Dell to customize, analyse, and/or improve our communication or relationship with you, and then only with business partners who share Dell's commitment to protecting your personal information. Except as described above, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have provided consent.
