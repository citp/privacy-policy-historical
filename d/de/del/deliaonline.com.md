# Our privacy policy from Delia Online

At Delia Online we are committed to protecting your privacy. Any personal information we request from you will be safeguarded under the Data Protection Act 1998. This Act regulates the processing of information relating to individuals, including the holding, use or disclosure of such information. Our data is stored in a secure database protected by a number of access controls.

Data collected through the registration process or market research processes on the site will be used to improve the site, helping us to tailor our services to your needs.

We may use the information you provide to communicate with you, but only if you have 'opted in' to receive our newsletter. You will not receive any other information from us as a result of supplying us with personal data **unless you specifically 'opt in' to do so**. You will be offered the opportunity to consent to receive information from specially vetted companies who we feel may be able to supply you with products that add value to your experience with Delia Online. In these circumstances, any information you provide will be subject to the privacy policies of these companies.

We may also share non-personal, non-individual information in aggregate form with our marketing partners for research purposes. In other words, we will not tell our marketing partners that you visited a certain page at the site, but we may tell them how many visitors visited that page.

Delia Online uses cookies in the operation of the site. These are small data files which store the information you provide us with and in doing so enable us to 'remember' the user on repeat visits and effectively let you move around the site without having to keep reintroducing yourself. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can set your browser to prevent this. If you choose not to accept our cookies, some services on our site will not be available (competitions, for example).

By using this website you agree that we may collect and use data as described above. We will always make it clear how we do this and allow you to select whether, and to whom, your details may be disclosed.

Should your personal information change, or you no longer require the services you have consented to, please e-mail us via [privacy@deliaonline.com](mailto:privacy@deliaonline.com) and we will ensure that your records are updated with immediate effect.

Delia Online reserves the right to share any information provided in response to a legal process, such as a court order or subpoena.
