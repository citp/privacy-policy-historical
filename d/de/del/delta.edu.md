# Privacy Statement - Delta College

This online privacy statement is intended to inform you of the ways in which this website (“Site”) collects information, the uses to which that information will be put, and the ways in which we protect information you choose to provide us. 

Use of this Site is subject to all applicable state and federal laws, as well as general Delta College policies. 

**Information Collected**

This Site collects two general types of information: (a) information you voluntarily provide to us, which may include personal information (such as your name, address, email address, etc.), and (b) information we collect automatically when you visit this Site through cookies, third-party tracking technologies and server logs. 

**Information Voluntarily Provided by You**

This Site will only collect personal information that you knowingly and voluntarily provide, for example, by responding to surveys, completing membership forms, sending emails, etc. It is this Site’s general practice to use personal information only for the purposes for which it was requested and any additional uses specifically stated on the Site. However, information collected through this Site may be subject to Delta College’s obligation to respond to subpoenas, court orders, discovery requests, and requests for public records under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. Further, the disclosure of information collected through this Site is subject to the provisions of the Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act. 

We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit or provide, and you do so at your own risk. Although this Site has security measures in place to protect personal information provided to us by users, users should also take steps to protect personal information. One way to do this is to close all web browsers after using the Site. Information disclosed in chat rooms, news groups, forums, message boards and similar contexts may become public. Users should therefore exercise caution before disclosing personal information in such contexts.
