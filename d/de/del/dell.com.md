# Dell's Online Policies

Dell respects your privacy. Across our business, around the world, we will only collect, store and use your personal information for defined purposes. We use your information to support and enhance our relationship with you, for example, to process your purchase, provide service and support, and share product, service and company news and offerings with you. We do not sell your personal information. We only share your personal data outside the Dell family of companies with your consent, as required by law or to protect Dell, its customers, or the public, or with companies that help Dell fulfill its obligations with you, and then only with partners who share Dell's commitment to protecting your privacy and data. At any time you may contact Dell with any privacy questions or concerns you may have. You also may ask at any time to see the data you have given us and request correction or deletion. We strive to ensure a high level of security and confidentiality. 

Privacy and Data Security

At Dell, your right to privacy and data security is a primary concern. That's why, when you visit dell.com, we help you maintain control over your personal data on the Internet. Below are the guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to our Internet site or when you use our online support offerings such as [support.dell.com](http://support.dell.com/) or support applications loaded on your computer. Please refer to your warranty statement or Dell's Total Satisfaction Policy for policies that apply to information contained on hard drives returned to Dell. [Other Dell and Dell co-branded sites may operate under their own privacy and security policies](https://web.archive.org/content/topics/global.aspx/policy/en/policy?c=us&l=en&s=gen&~section=011). Visit [www.nclnet.org/essentials](http://www.nclnet.org/essentials) to learn more about how to protect your privacy on the Internet through a consumer education campaign called Online E-ssentials, developed by Dell in partnership with the National Consumers League. 

Dell is a proud participant in the BBB OnLine®  Privacy Program. The BBB _OnLine_ Privacy Program is backed by an organization noted for its expertise and experience in conducting successful national self-regulation programs--the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The mission of BBB OnLine is to promote trust and confidence on the Internet by advocating ethical online business practices. Further information about this program is available at [http://www.bbbonLine.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/cks.asp?id=3151999031006). 

Dell's Privacy statement discloses the privacy guidelines for the entire domestic Dell Web site. **The guidelines at this site are applicable only to this domestic Web site.**

Dell only asks for specific types of personal information

In a few areas on our Web site and online customer support tools, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your site visit, to assist you with technical support issues or to follow up with you after your visit. It is completely optional for you to participate. 

For example, we request information from you when you: 

  1. Register on dell.com
  2. Request a quote
  3. Place an order
  4. Provide feedback in an online survey
  5. Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer
  6. Request e-mail notification of your order status (called "Order Watch")
  7. Subscribe to a newsletter or a mailing list
  8. Request assistance from our "Product Advisor"
  9. Fill out a support request



In each of the instances above, we may ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, address, type of business, customer preference information, customer number and service tag number, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. If we ever ask for significantly different information we will inform you. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time. 

Dell only uses your personal information for specific purposes

The information you provide will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with Dell. Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information on dell.com and alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new products and services from Dell. Agents or contractors of Dell who have access to your personal information and prospect information are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Dell. Dell may enhance or merge your information collected at its site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you. 

In addition, Dell may be required to disclose personal information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, regulation, and other legal action or if Dell reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to protect Dell, its customers, or the public. 

You can opt-out of receiving further marketing from Dell at any time

Periodically, we may send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only Dell (or agents working on behalf of Dell and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily opt-out of receiving further marketing from Dell by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/content/topics/global.aspx/policy/en/policy?c=us&l=en&s=gen&~section=009). 

Dell will not disclose your personal information to any outside organization for its use in marketing without your consent

Information regarding you (such as name, address and phone number) or your order and the products you purchase will not be given or sold to any outside organization for its use in marketing or solicitation without your consent. Your information may be shared with agents or contractors of Dell for the purpose of performing services for Dell. 

Internet Commerce

The online store at dell.com is designed to give you options concerning the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail and any other information you provide us. Dell is committed to data security with respect to information collected on our site. We offer the industry standard security measures available through your browser called SSL encryption, (please see Dell's [Store Security](https://web.archive.org/content/topics/global.aspx/policy/en/policy?c=us&l=en&s=gen&~section=006) page for details on these security measures). If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may contact a sales representative over the telephone. Simply call 1-800-WWW-DELL. It has always been a Dell practice to contact customers in the event of a potential problem with your purchase or any normal business communication regarding your purchase. 

Customized Experience

We use technology to help us deliver customized visitor experiences. At Dell, we primarily use "cookies" to help us determine which service and support information is appropriate to your machine and to maintain your shopping experience in our online store. Our use of this technology does not mean that we automatically know any information about you. We might be able to ascertain what type of computer you are using, but beyond that, our use of cookies is designed only to provide you with a better experience when using www.dell.com. Dell has no desire or intent to infringe on your privacy while using the dell.com site. For more information about our use of cookies, please click [here](https://web.archive.org/content/topics/global.aspx/policy/en/policy?c=us&l=en&s=gen&~section=001). 

Third-Party Sites

Please be aware that other web sites that may be accessed through our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those third-party web sites linked to Dell.com are not covered by this privacy statement. We generally use the "" symbol to mark links that go to third-party sites. 

You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. While we strive to protect your personal information, Dell cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

Children's Privacy (Age 12 and Under)

Dell takes children's privacy seriously. 

Dell does not seek to collect personal information about children through its Web site. Dell does not condition a child's participation in an activity on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. 

If we become aware that a person submitting personal information to us through any part of our Web site is a child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. 

Since we do not seek to collect any personal information about children, and we delete any information collected inadvertently as soon as we discover that a child has submitted it, we typically retain no information about children that could be reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of information about their child before we have discovered and deleted the information, then we will of course honor that request. 

Other Web sites

Dell's Web site contains links to other Web sites that are not operated by Dell. _Dell is not responsible for the privacy practices of the Web sites that it does not operate._ Some parts of the Web site are animated using various downloadable applications, such as Macromedia's Shockwave/Flash. We also make video available through RealNetwork's Media-Player, and use the video hosting services of Broadcast.com. Futures-Careers, Macromedia, RealNetworks, and Broadcast.com operate under their own privacy and security policies, and the way they may collect and use information can be further evaluated at: [www.macromedia.com](http://www.macromedia.com/), [www.realnetworks.com](http://www.realnetworks.com/), and [www.broadcast.com](http://www.broadcast.com/).
