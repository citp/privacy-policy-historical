Global Privacy Policy

At Dell, helping you manage privacy and the protection of personal information is among our primary concerns. That's why, when you choose Dell, we help you maintain control over personal information about you. Below are the guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us during your experience with our company through any means, such as when you use our web sites, interact with us through our products and other services, when we speak with you over the telephone, and if you work directly with our technical support teams. We also want you to be aware that we take careful measures surrounding the information that you provide through any of our online support offerings such as [support.dell.com](http://support.dell.com/support/index.aspx) or support applications loaded on your computer. Please refer to your warranty statements or service contracts, or Dell's Return Policy for policies that apply to information contained on hard drives returned or downloaded to Dell. 

Visit [www.nclnet.org/technology/essentials](http://www.nclnet.org/technology/essentials/) to learn more about how to protect your privacy on the Internet through a consumer education campaign called Online E-ssentials, developed by Dell in partnership with the National Consumers League. 

Scope

This summary provides highlights of the full Dell [Global Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/content/topics/global.aspx/policy/en/privacy_policy?c=us&l=en&s=gen) and applies to Dell Inc. and its worldwide corporate affiliates ("we" or "our") but not to those Dell corporate affiliates that operate and have published their own privacy and security policies, including but not limited to Dell Financial Services and Alienware. This privacy statement also does not apply to the web sites of our business partners or to any other third parties, even if their web sites are linked to our web site. We recommend you review the privacy policies of each web site you visit.

"Business partners" means any subcontractor, vendor or other entity with whom we have an ongoing business relationship to provide products, services, or information. "Personal information" means information which identifies you, such as your name, telephone number, and e-mail address. In some cases, the policy may be tailored to account for variances in law in a particular country. However, this policy is intended to be global in nature.
