Scope of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies only to Personal Information collected from individual customers. It does not apply to corporate or business contact information. In addition, this policy is not applicable to Personal Information that has been aggregated or made anonymous and no longer specifically relates to an identifiable individual. Dell reserves the right to use aggregated or anonymous information in any manner it considers appropriate.

Information We Collect

We may ask you to provide Personal Information when you 

  * Use our website;
  * Request quotes, services, support, or information;
  * Place orders for products or services;
  * Apply for credit card or financing;
  * Participate in surveys, sweepstakes, or other promotional activities;
  * Subscribe to newsletters, promotional emails, or other materials;
  * Apply for a job, submit your resume/CV, or create a candidate profile; or
  * Contact us.



Information we may request includes your email address, name, home address, and telephone number. If you make a purchase, we may ask for your credit card number and billing information.

We may also ask for your Social Insurance Number (SIN) and other data to process your credit or financing request as permitted by law. If your choice of payment for a Dell product is by way of leasing, we will ask for your Social Insurance Number (SIN). This is requested so that we can provide your information to a credit bureau in order to perform a credit analysis. The SIN is the best way to ensure that the information we are provided actually refers to you. This will avoid us making incorrect conclusions about your financial status. However, you should be aware that using your SIN in this manner is voluntary and you have the right to refuse to provide it to us.

Job applicants may be requested to provide information such as educational background, employment experience, job interest information, and criminal background checks. We may also collect demographic information, such as your business or company information, age, gender, interests, preferences and favorites. Forms that you fill in may indicate whether information requested is mandatory or voluntary for the purpose for which the information is requested.

We may collect information about your visits to our websites, including the pages you view, the links and ads you click, search terms you enter, and other actions you take in connection with the Dell websites and services. We may also collect certain information from the browser you used to come to our website, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, access times, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the website that referred you to our website and to which URL you browse away from our site if you click on a link on our site.

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Dell, information collected through one source may be combined with information obtained through other Dell resources. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other parties. For example, Dell may collect data on which pages you visit on the website and later combine this information on purchases you complete on Dell.com. We may use the combined data to determine which ads to serve you on Dell.com or third party websites or to determine what ads to include in future emails sent to you.

Some Dell services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Dell and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services, and may use the information according to each company's privacy statement and other agreements with you.

How We Use Personal Information

Dell uses your personal information to: 

  * Deliver the services and support, or carry out, the transactions you have requested;
  * Send communications to you, such as product safety information, your transactions status (for example, order confirmations), information about products and services available from Dell and its corporate affiliates, promotional offers, and surveys;
  * Customize, analyze, and improve our products, services (including the content and advertisements on our website), technologies, communications and relationship with you;
  * Identify patterns of behavior to offer relevant suggestions to users. For example, based on non-identifiable data collected through cookies on our website, we may be able to determine that users who viewed certain products may also like other specific products. These cookies are not tied to personal identifiers;
  * Enforce our conditions of sale, website terms and/or separate contracts (if applicable) with you;
  * Prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities;
  * Protect the security or integrity of the website, our business, or our products or services; or
  * Otherwise, as disclosed to you at the point of collection.



Personal Information collected may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Dell or its corporate affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and as such, courts in those other foreign jurisdictions may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to access your Personal Information.

Disclosing Personal Information

We may share your Personal Information with corporate affiliates to carry out transactions you request or to make our business or that of our corporate affiliates more responsive to your needs. We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, or other legal action; as required by law or regulation; or if Dell reasonably believes it is necessary to protect Dell, its customers, or the public. 

In addition, we may share your Personal Information with business partners that help Dell carry out transactions you request, that help Dell promote and market additional goods, services and special offers from us and/or our corporate affiliates, or that help Dell to customize, analyze, and/or improve our communication or relationship with you, and then only with business partners who share Dell's commitment to protecting your Personal Information. For example, Dell may use business partners to deliver email to Dell customers, may work with business partners to customize ads based on pages users visit on Dell.com, or may allow business partners to collect aggregate information to identify trends and analyze which pages are visited most often by visitors to Dell.com. Dell may disclose Personal Information to business partners to complete transactions or market on Dell's behalf, but those business partners are prohibited from using your Personal Information for their own marketing purposes. 

All such business partners are required to limit their use of your Personal Information for the purposes and in the manner we have instructed them.

All business partners who receive information from Dell to use on Dell's behalf are obligated to manage the information under Dell's privacy policy. 

Except as described above, we will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have provided consent. 

We reserve the right to disclose and/or transfer Personal Information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession), lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of Dell Inc. Or its corporate affiliates, or of any of the business or assets or shares of Dell Inc. or Dell Canada Inc. or its corporate affiliates, or divisions thereof in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services from the third party.

In addition, from time to time and where appropriate, Dell may request your specific authorization or consent. If you choose to withdraw your consent, and for certain reasons, Dell is unable to comply with your request, we will always advise you that we cannot do so. These could include reasons such as: 

  * You have selected the leasing option as payment for your purchase of one of our products and we require use of your Personal Information in order to continue processing your monthly payments;
  * Withdrawing your consent would result in our inability to fulfill the terms of your contract for products and/or services with us; or
  * There are legal requirements for the use of your Personal Information.



Please be aware that in certain circumstances, Dell may be required to disclose your Personal Information without your consent such as to law enforcement or other government officials. This could arise, for example, where disclosure is required:

  * To legal authorities for the detection and prevention of fraud or other criminal activity; or
  * To our legal counsel in the event that any matter may the subject of litigation.
