# Dell's Policies + Processes | Dell Canada

Dell respects your privacy. Across our business, around the world, we will only collect, store and use your personal information for defined purposes. We use your information to support and enhance our relationship with you, for example, to process your purchase, provide service and support, and share product, service and company news and offerings with you. We do not sell your personal information. We only share your personal data outside the Dell family of companies with your consent, as required by law or to protect Dell, its customers, or the public, or with companies that help Dell fulfill its obligations with you, and then only with partners who share Dell's commitment to protecting your privacy and data. At any time you may contact Dell with any privacy questions or concerns you may have. You also may ask at any time to see the data you have given us and request correction or deletion. We strive to ensure a high level of security and confidentiality.

At Dell, your right to privacy and data security is a primary concern. That's why, whether you are purchasing a product or service from us or obtaining technical support, whether online or dealing with one of sales or technical support representatives over the phone, or simply visiting [dell.ca](http://www.dell.com/intl/ca/),.we strive to ensure that every customer experience is safe and secure. Dell has prepared this Privacy Policy to inform you about our ongoing commitment to ensuring your personal information remains accurate, confidential and used only for identified purposes, regardless of how it is provided to us. This Policy also addresses how you can inquire about the personal information we hold about you and how we will respond to such a request. 

Dell has certain specific guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to our Internet site ( **www.dell.ca** ) or when you use our online support offerings such as **support.dell.ca** . Other Dell and Dell Co-branded sites may operate under their own privacy and security policies. You can also visit www.nclnet.org/essentials to learn more about how to protect your privacy on the internet through a consumer education campaign called Online E-ssentials, developed by Dell in partnership with the National Consumers League. 

Additional Dell website and privacy information is available on the left.
