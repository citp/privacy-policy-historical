To ensure the security of information transfer, Deltastock uses an SSL certificate to encrypt information transmitted by or to the visitor through the website.

### Use of Information

Deltastock uses the non-public personal information containing personal data collected from clients in order to establish and service clients' accounts for trading in financial instruments.

Deltastock will use the data collected from the client to establish their identity in accordance with the applicable law, as well as to enter into an agreement with the client for providing the services offered by the company. The data gathered will also be used to classify the client as a retail or unprofessional client – and with regard to this, to provide them with the legally established set of documents and other information.

Unless the client is informed otherwise, the non-public information and personal data that Deltastock holds is also used for:

  * reviewing the client’s ongoing needs;
  * AML (anti-money laundering) measures and fraud prevention;
  * enhancing customer service and products;
  * providing ongoing information or opportunities that Deltastock believes may be of interest to the client.



### Disclosure of Information

Deltastock does not disclose clients' non-public information and personal data to any non-affiliated third parties or to affiliated entities, except as permitted by applicable law.

Depending on the product or service concerned and particular restrictions on confidential information, personal client data and information may be disclosed to:

  * service providers and specialist advisers who have been contracted to provide Deltastock with administrative, financial, legal, research, or other services;
  * courts and regulatory authorities, in accordance with or as prescribed by law;
  * anyone authorised by the client, as specified by that individual or the contract.



If the client does not wish Deltastock to use their personal information, they should inform the company in writing. If the client decides to do so, Deltastock may not be able to provide them with information about services and/or products requested by them, and also the products and services themselves; and with regard to this, Deltastock will have no liability to the client in respect of the same.

### Updating or Deleting Client Data

The client should inform Deltastock in a timely manner that their personal data has changed by sending an email to [office@deltastock.com](mailto:office@deltastock.com).

The client should inform Deltastock if they wish their personal data to be deleted by sending an email to [office@deltastock.com](mailto:office@deltastock.com).

Deltastock will change or delete a client’s personal data in accordance with their instructions, except to the extent, terms and manner that Deltastock is required to hold clients’ personal data for regulatory or legal purposes, in order to provide the client with the services they have requested, or due to the fact that it has provided the services during a past period, and must now maintain certain information until a certain regulatory deadline.

### Cookies and IP Addresses

To make using the website as straightforward as possible and to improve the services it offers, Deltastock uses cookies and IP addresses.

Cookies are information packages sent by the web server to the user’s or client’s Internet browser, and which are sent back by the browser each time it accesses the same server. These information packages are saved and stored on the user’s or client’s computer by the Internet browser.

There are two main types of cookies:

  * Transient (or per-session) cookies: These only exist during the user’s website visit, and are deleted on exit. These cookies recognise the user as they move between the website pages; for example, recording items added to an online shopping basket. These cookies also help maintain security.
  * Persistent (or permanent) cookies: These stay on the user’s computer until expiry or deletion. Many are built with an automatic deletion date to help ensure the computer’s hard drive doesn’t get overloaded. These cookies often store and re-enter login information, so the user doesn't need to remember their login details.



Deltastock would like to inform its clients and website users that it uses Google Analytics to analyse the use of the website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers. The information gathered relating to the website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google’s Privacy Policy can be found here: <http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html>.

Deltastock uses cookies to:

  * gather information about the journey across the website of website users and clients of the financial services offered by the company;
  * ensure client and user security on the website;

  * store information about users’ marketing and product preferences, which helps improve targeting
  * store information about users’ dwell time on the website;
  * evaluate the website’s advertising and promotional effectiveness (the data collected by Deltastock is anonymous, and is not shared with any third parties).



Deltastock uses both its own (first party) and partner companies’ (third party) cookies to support these activities.

Deltastock doesn’t use cookies to track users’ and clients’ Internet usage after leaving the website and doesn’t store information that third parties could read or track. Deltastock will not exchange, sell, or lease cookie information without the express consent of the user.

### Changing Cookie Settings

To enable or disable cookies, it is necessary to follow the instructions provided by the web browser, which are usually located within the ‘Help’, ‘Tools’ or ‘Edit’ menus.

Alternatively, an external resource is available at [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies), providing specific information about cookies and how to manage them to suit the user’s preferences.

Users and clients must be aware that should they choose to disable cookies in their browsers, they may not be able to access secure areas of the website; for example, online accounts.

### Secure Online Services

Any secure online services the user or client has subscribed to with Deltastock may use cookies in order to enable information about the user and their preferences to be stored, and also to prevent unauthorised access to those services and information. In such circumstances, cookies must usually be accepted and enabled within the browser, since without them Deltastock cannot ensure that the user’s or client’s information is secure. This is the reason why users rejecting cookies can’t use the secure online services.

### IP Address

An IP address is a unique number that identifies the user’s or client’s computer while connected to the Internet. IP addresses are not linked to personal information. Besides for purposes of identification of the user’s or client’s computer, Deltastock also uses IP addresses to analyse overall user behaviour and preferences on the website.

### Protection of Information

Clients' non-public information and personal data are kept in a secure and strictly confidential manner, and are accessed and used only by employees who service the client's account.

Deltastock uses advanced security software and technology to ensure a safe and secure trading environment and to protect clients' non-public personal, financial and trading information.

### Opt-out Procedure

It is Deltastock's policy not to disclose non-public client information to third parties, except in legally defined cases.

The client has no obligation to provide any part of their non-public information or personal data that may be requested by Deltastock.

The client’s refusal to provide the information or personal data requested by Deltastock may result in Deltastock's inability to open or maintain the client's account for trading in financial instruments, or to provide financial services to them.

### Amendments to Privacy Policy

Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be published promptly on Deltastock's website and will serve as notification to clients.

### Client Consent

By opening an account for trading in financial instruments with Deltastock and/or by using Deltastock’s website, the company client and/or website user give their consent to the collection and use of non-public information and personal data by Deltastock, as provided in this Privacy Policy.

### Law and Jurisdiction

This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Bulgaria, and any disputes relating to this Policy shall be resolved between the parties themselves, and in case of failure to do so, they shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Republic of Bulgaria.
