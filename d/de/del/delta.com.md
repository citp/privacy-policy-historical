Delta uses cookies, tags, and other similar technologies. These technologies allow us to recognize your preference information, keep track of your purchases, remember your SkyMiles number and facilitate effective site administration. We use the information we collect to enhance your visit to delta.com and to provide you with information tailored to your needs.

Your Internet browser(s) may offer you the option to refuse cookies; however, doing so may affect your use of some portions of Delta’s and our partners' web services. Please refer to your browser options or other browser instructional materials to learn more about cookie management.

Delta has engaged third party tracking and advertising providers such as DoubleClick to act on Delta's behalf to track and analyze your usage of our sites through the use of cookies, pixel tags / web beacons, and similar technologies. These third parties collect, and share with us, as we may request, web site usage information about visits to our sites, measure and research the effectiveness of our advertisements, track page usage and paths followed during visits through our sites, help us target our Internet banner advertisements on our sites and on other sites, and track use of our Internet banner advertisements and other links from our marketing partners' sites to our sites. The information collected on Delta’s behalf by these third parties does not contain your name, address, email address, or any other personally identifiable information. To see further information about cookies on delta.com and opt out of some as you choose, see the descriptions and links below.

The website at Delta.com, whether accessed on a computer or a mobile device, is not at this time configured to read or respond to “do not track” settings or signals in your browser headings, which vary by browser provider.  In lieu of a browser-based opt-out solution, we have identified below certain Digital Advertising Alliance and other approved methods for placement of “opt-out” cookies.  Our site and those of our third party advertisers or other vendors are configured to read and honor these opt-out cookies, so long as they are present on your computer. (If you delete all cookies, you will need to reset your opt-out cookies.)  Specific instructions on how to do so follow.  However, please be aware that Delta does not control these opt-out processes. 

When you use the Fly Delta, mobile app, a unique ID (which varies by device manufacturer and operating system) is read from or associated with your device to be used as an anonymous identifier for analytics and performance purposes.  We don’t store the ID, or share the ID or other unique information collected or used by the app with third parties, except for service providers such as Adobe, whose analytics product generates this ID to track and analyze the performance of our app.  We do not use information gathered within the app to serve you targeted advertisements. The “limit ad tracking” or similar advertising-related privacy settings offered by device manufacturers do not change how your device is tracked by Delta.
