We use push notification tokens in the App to send notifications to your mobile device with updates for flight times, gate changes, and flight cancellations.

If you choose, the App can access your device calendar to save itinerary information in your personal schedule. It can also bring up your default e-mail program, so you can send notes and reminders while traveling.

At times, we may promote the App via internet advertising on external websites. If you click on these advertisements and navigate directly to a third party application or other platform, information such as your phone’s device identification number may be sent to the advertising network, so that they and we may track the effectiveness of our advertising.

Failure to provide this information will mean we cannot provide the service.

If you do not provide this information, we may not be able to enter into or perform the contract or provide the products and services.

You may opt out of  _all information_  collected via the App by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall, application, and data management processes available through your mobile device.

If you use our App without disabling location tracking features, you consent to our use of your location data as provided in section 4.1 of this Privacy Policy.

The “limited tracking” or similar advertising-related privacy settings offered by device manufacturers do not change how your device is tracked by Delta.

7.  **WITH WHOM DOES DELTA SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?**

7.1.  **In general**

We do not sell your name or other personal information to third parties, and do not intend to do so in the future.

We may disclose your information we collect or receive:

  * to third parties to process your information on our behalf, or to assist us in providing our services and/or products, such as our customer care center operators and providers of technical services such as data centers; however, Delta requires that third parties comply with Delta’s Privacy Policy when processing your information.
  * to the party providing the service or product when you request or purchase services or products through Delta that are to be provided by another party (for example, a travel segment on another carrier, hotel accommodations, or rental car).
  * to you or those acting on your behalf. Where local regulations require, we may obtain your consent in writing for the purpose of allowing someone else to act on your behalf.
  * to our [SkyMiles Partners](https://web.archive.org/content/www/en_US/skymiles/how-to-earn-miles/airline-partners.html) **,  **Promotional Partners ** ** and other Delta group companies for the purposes described in and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  * to other airlines, including members of our  **SkyTeam  **alliance, for the purpose of servicing your travel, servicing your flight reservation, or rebooking your flight in the event of an unexpected disruption in your travel.
  * to banks, financial firms and payment services for the purposes of processing payments and refunds.
  * to government agencies and authorities, law enforcement officials, law courts, or to third parties: (a) if we believe disclosure is required by applicable law, regulation or legal process (such as pursuant to a subpoena or judicial order); or (b) to protect and defend our rights, or the rights or safety of third parties, including to establish, make, or defend against legal claims.
  * to customs and immigrations authorities, which require by law access to booking and travel itinerary information including "Advanced Passenger Information" (passport and  associated personal information) for all passengers prior to travel.
  * to passengers traveling under the same booking as you.
  * to persons providing services to Delta, including its professional advisers (e.g. auditors, lawyers, and technical consultants).
  * to persons with whom we are discussing selling any part of our business or to whom we sell any part of our business.



We may share with third parties anonymous, aggregated information about all our users.

If your ticket is purchased pursuant to a corporate incentive agreement, we may disclose information concerning your travel to your employer or corporate travel manager.

When you use the App, a unique ID (which varies by device manufacturer and operating system) is read from or associated with your device to be used as an anonymous identifier for analytics and performance purposes. This ID might be generated by or shared with third parties providing us with analytics services, such as Adobe.

7.2.  **Social Media**

You may wish to share information regarding your travel or other activities with Delta on social media platforms provided by third parties. To utilize social media sharing features, you will be prompted to grant permissions within those third-party platforms, as you choose. For example, you will need to allow account login and publishing permissions. If you choose to contact or interact with us on a third-party social media platform, you understand that you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions and privacy policy applicable to the third-party platform. The activity on third-party social media platforms, and the data processed, stored, and provided on them, including data regarding interactions with Delta, is covered by the terms and conditions and privacy policy of those third-party platforms.  


7.3.  **Disclosure of personal information to passengers travelling under the same booking**

When you make a booking, you will be provided with a booking reference such as a confirmation number or record locater number. Your booking reference should be kept confidential at all times. Disclosing your booking reference to other passengers may allow them to access your booking details through our systems. If you are travelling with others under the same booking and would not like your individual booking details to be disclosed to them, you may prefer to have each person make and pay for separate bookings.

7.4.  **Delta Biometrics optional facial recognition technology at participating airports**

Our customers at certain participating airports in the United States (currently, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Terminal F), including customers flying on Aeromexico, Air France-KLM or Virgin Atlantic, will have the option of using facial recognition technology when flying direct to an international destination to:

  * Check-in at the self-service kiosks in the lobby;  

  * Drop checked baggage at the counters in the lobby;
  * Serve as identification at the TSA check point;
  * Board the aircraft at the departure gate; and
  * Go through U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) processing when arriving into the U.S. on an international flight.



Any Delta Biometrics experience or biometric test with Delta is optional. If you choose to use facial recognition at a participating airport, your image, once captured, is encrypted and sent to CBP. To protect the security and privacy of your image, no additional information, such as name, document number, or date of birth, is sent with the image. CBP uses your image to verify your identity by comparing your image against images associated with your passport, other travel documents, or prior CBP border inspections, and Delta receives confirmation of your identity from CBP. Delta does not retain your biometric information. If you are a U.S. citizen, CBP deletes your image following verification in accordance with CBP policy. For certain non-U.S. citizens, CBP uses your image as biometric confirmation of departure from the United States. For more information, visit [www.CBP.govopens in a new window](http://www.cbp.gov/).

9.  **YOUR RIGHTS**

This section 9 applies only to individuals in the European Union and other countries which grant the rights described here. These rights will apply only in certain circumstances.

9.1.  **Requesting a copy of your information**

To the extent you are legally entitled, you can request confirmation of whether or not we process your personal information, and details of the information that we hold about you and how we use it.

You also have a right to access your personal information and to be provided with a copy.

9.2.  **Right to rectification of personal data**

If you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we correct it. You may also request us to complete personal data about you which is incomplete.

9.3.  **Right to restrict processing of personal data**

You have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal information where one of the following applies:

  * You claim that the personal data is not accurate. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to ensure the accuracy of the personal data.



  * The processing is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase the personal data.



  * We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still need it in connection with a legal claim.



  * You have exercised your right to object to the processing. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing



9.4.  **Right to request deletion of personal data ("right to be forgotten")**

    You may request the erasure of your personal information in certain circumstances. For example, you may  
    request erasure if:

  * The personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.
  * You have withdrawn your consent and we have no other legal basis for processing the personal information.
  *  You have exercised your right to object to processing the personal information, and we have no overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing it.



Under certain circumstances, we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where we need to use the personal data to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, make or defend legal claims.

If you exercise your right to erasure, this will potentially remove records which we hold for your benefit, such as your SkyMiles account information (including miles that may be in your SkyMiles account) and your presence on a marketing suppression list.

9.5.  **Right to object to processing of personal data**

You have a right, at any stage, to object to our using your personal information to send you marketing information.

You also have the right to object to our using your personal information where our reason is based on our legitimate interests. We will have to stop processing until we can establish that we have compelling legitimate grounds which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or that we need to continue using it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

9.6.  **Right to data portability**

This right applies where:

  * Our reason for using your personal information is either that you have given consent or that the processing is necessary for us to perform a contract with you; and



  * We process the personal information by automated means.



This is a right to receive all the personal information which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this to another controller directly, where this is technically feasible.

9.7.  **Complaints to regulator**

You have a right to complain to a supervisory authority (i.e., a regulator which oversees data protection law compliance), in particular, in the European Union country where you live or work or where you consider we have infringed on your privacy rights.

9.8.  **Exercising these rights**

We may charge you a small administration fee to respond to your request as allowed by applicable law. In general, we do not charge any fee where the right is based on European Union law. (We can charge an administrative fee for extra copies of your information and in certain exceptional circumstances.)

Where we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we will provide information on the action we take on the request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. This time may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, for example, where requests are complex or numerous.

Where we do not carry out your request, we will tell you without delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request, and we will explain our reasons for not taking the action requested.

Any request you make must be in writing and include your name and address and any other information that may identify you, such as where your request relates to a travel booking, please provide your booking reference (e.g., confirmation number or record locater number), SkyMiles Account number if you have one, the dates on which the travel took place, and any other relevant information that will assist us to identify your booking. You must also provide a photocopy of your passport or driver’s license so we can verify your identity. Please send your written requests to:

Data Protection Officer  
1030 Delta Blvd  
Department 981  
Atlanta, GA 30354, USA

Or, you can submit this request to our Data Protection Officer by emailing us at [Privacy@delta.com](mailto:Privacy@delt.com).

10.  **MINORS**

Other than information required to complete a booking, Delta does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian may by emailing us at [Privacy@delta.com](mailto:Privacy@delta.com). We will remove the information and unsubscribe the child from any of our electronic marketing lists. Where required by applicable law, we may ask children for consent from their parents or guardians before we book their flight or provide a product or service to them.

11.  **LINKS**

Our Website contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites, and Delta’s Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected from you by those sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each site that collects information from you. When you are leaving our Website via a link to interact with a site that is not governed by our Privacy Policy, a new browser window will open.

12.  **SECURITY**

Information Security is important to Delta. We have established appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards to protect the information we collect in accordance with our Privacy Policy. These safeguards are regularly reviewed to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, and improper use of your information, and to maintain the accuracy and integrity of that data.

13.  **PROMOTIONAL PARTNERS**

We want to give you more opportunities to earn miles in the Delta SkyMiles Program. One of the ways we do this is by sharing your information with Promotional Partners. Typically, these promotional offerings are limited in quantity and geographic reach and targeted to specific demographic audiences. If you fall within the audience a Promotional Partner is trying to reach, and (where required under applicable law) you have consented to receive information about their services, you may receive a promotional e-mail or direct mail. Although we select our partners with care, these partners have their own privacy policies that apply to the way they use your personal data.

If you do not want us to share your information with one of these partners, you can always opt out by contacting us by using the [ **Email Us**](https://www.delta.com/contactus/commentComplaint) page or by calling the SkyMiles Service Center at +1-800-323- 2323.

14.  **DATA TRANSFERS**

Delta is based in Atlanta, Georgia, USA and we may transfer personal information in compliance with applicable law to the US and other jurisdictions where Delta provides services.

For EU Residents: Some of the countries where Delta provides services may not have the equivalent level of data protection laws as those in your location. If we need to transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will take steps to make sure your personal data is protected and safeguarded once it leaves the EEA. In particular, we require third parties to whom we transfer your data to agree to abide by the Model Clauses approved by the European Commission and permitted under Article 46 of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). If you would like to obtain the details of such safeguards, you can request them from the Data Protection Officer at Privacy@delta.com. In some limited circumstances, we may also transfer your information outside the EEA if the GDPR (under Article 49) allows this. This includes where it is necessary for the performance of a contract between us and you and where the transfer is necessary in connection with legal proceedings.
