This Privacy Policy was last updated and is effective as of January 26, 2012. 

This Privacy Policy applies to Del Taco LLC’s (“Del Taco” “we” “our”) websites (including www.deltaco.com, www.deltacowebstore.com and www.deltacofranchise.com), interactive features and mobile sites that post a link to it (collectively “Sites”) whether accessed via personal computers, mobile devices, tablets or otherwise (collectively, “Device”). This Privacy Policy covers information collected at these websites. It does not cover any information collected at any other websites, including those maintained by Del Taco franchisees, or offline by Del Taco (unless specifically stated, such as in our stores in connection with a consumer promotion). This Privacy Policy explains how Del Taco collects, uses and shares information when you access or use our Sites. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and review the Terms of Use, which governs your use of the Sites. 

**Your California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as “Shine the Light” Law, allows California residents to request and obtain from businesses once a year, free of charge, information about their personal information (if any) a business has disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. Businesses are not obligated to furnish this information if they do not share personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without the consumer’s express consent.   Del Taco does not share consumers’ personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without consumers’ consent. California residents may request further information about our approach to this law by writing to our legal department: General Counsel

  1. **Collection of Personally Identifiable Information You Submit to the Sites**

We may collect “Personally Identifiable Information” (which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as first and last name, e-mail address, credit card and mobile telephone number) at certain areas of our Sites, such as when you sign-up to receive newsletters, purchase merchandise and gift cards, apply for a job or complete our franchise opportunity inquiry form. We may also collect certain demographic information (such as gender or age) and information about your interests and preferences (collectively, “Demographic Information”). If we combine Demographic Information together with Personally Identifiable Information, then such combined information will be treated as Personally Identifiable Information.

We and our third-party service providers, including analytic companies, use technology that automatically or passively collects certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Sites or one of our advertisements on another website (“Usage Information”).

We may use Usage Information for many purposes, including to enhance our Sites. We collect your IP address or other unique identifier for your Device used to access the Sites (“Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Sites, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. When we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with you, we will treat it as Personally Identifiable Information. We may use the following methods, among others, to collect Usage Information:

Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons may be used for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, and to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened. 
    3. _**Embedded Scripts**_ **.** An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links on which you click. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
