          <h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
      
            <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as “Shine the Light” Law, allows California residents to request and obtain from businesses once a year, free of charge, information about their personal information (if any) a business has disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. Businesses are not obligated to furnish this information if they do not share personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without the consumer's consent. Del Taco does not share consumers' personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without consumers' consent. California residents may request further information about our approach to this law by writing to our legal department:<br>

              We and our third-party service providers, including analytic companies, use technology that automatically or passively collects certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Sites or one of our advertisements on another website (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may include your browser type, the URL that referred you to our Sites, and areas within our Sites that you visit, among other information.

When we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with you, we will treat it as Personally Identifiable Information. We may use the following methods, among others, to collect Usage Information:<br><br>
                <ol class="number-list">
                  <li type="a"><u><strong>Cookies</strong></u>. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites.

We may include web beacons in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons may be used for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, and to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened.</li>
