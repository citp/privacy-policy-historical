We recommend you review the privacy statements of the other parties with whom you interact.

This privacy statement governs personal information we collect from our customers and online from our website users ("you"), through Dell products, services, software, websites, contacts or our relationship with you. Please refer to your warranty statements and Dell's Return Policy for policies that apply to information contained on hard drives returned to Dell.

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Dell, information collected through one source may be combined with information obtained through other Dell resources. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other parties.

Some Dell services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company.

#### How We and Our Partners Use Cookies and Web Beacons

 **How We and Our Partners Use Cookies  
** Dell websites use Dell and third party "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a piece of text that is placed on your computer's hard drive. Depending on the settings you have selected, your browser adds the text to your device as a small file. You can change the browser settings as described below; many browsers are set to accept cookies by default. We use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly.

 **Targeted Display Advertising by Dell and Others  
** Dell also works with third party advertising and personalization partners that use cookies to help us display personalized content and appropriate advertising during your visits to Dell.com and other websites. Cookies placed by our third party partners also assist us with measuring the performance of our advertising campaigns.

Similarly, third parties use cookies to deliver advertising for companies other than Dell to you on the internet, whether you are on Dell.com or another website, based on your visits to Dell.com and other websites and to measure the effectiveness of those advertising campaigns. These cookies assist the third parties in identifying the pages you view, the links and ads you click on, other actions you take on those web pages, and the site from which you came before arriving at a web page.  
[Learn more](https://web.archive.org/spredir.ashx/solutions/ads-and-emails) about targeted advertising and how to opt out.

 **“Do Not Track” Signals  
** Please note that while you may have the opportunity to opt-out of targeted advertising through the “Learn more” link above and you may be able to control the use of cookies through your web browser as described in the “How We and Our Partners Use Cookies” section above, some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting that sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing. This is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies. Dell does not respond to web browser “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Statement. For more information about do not track, visit [www.allaboutdnt.org](http://www.allaboutdnt.org/). 

**Targeted Email Marketing by Dell  
** Some marketing you receive, including email marketing, may also be personalized based on your visits to Dell.com and your browsing and purchase history. In addition, when you click on some links in email marketing you receive, our email service provider may place a cookie on your browser. This cookie would be linked to your email address and used to gather information about the products and services you view and purchase on Dell.com. Information gathered may be used to personalize and customize future email marketing messages you receive. You may opt out of this use by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in every personalized email marketing message you receive.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Dell websites and services that depend on cookies.

How We and Our Partners Use Web Beacons  
** Dell or third parties with whom we have contracted or sub contracted, may use web beacons on our website, in our emails, in our advertisements on other websites, or in our advertisements in others' emails. Similarly, third parties whose content or ads appear at Dell.com, or whose emails Dell.com sends to our users, may also place web beacons in their ads or emails for purposes of measuring the effectiveness of the content, ads or email.

A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or email. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our website and our advertising in various ways. For example, web beacons may count the number of individuals who visit our website from a particular advertisement or who make a purchase from our website after viewing a particular advertisement or they may tell us when a web page is viewed and provide a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons may also measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon an email message, determining when an email message is opened and determining how many times an email message is forwarded.

The information we collect through web beacons may include some limited personal information, and web beacons allow us to recognize users by accessing Dell cookies. We may also combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other personal information we have collected from you. We use all of this information to better tailor our marketing to you and may use this information for other purposes, such as to enable a shopping cart, customize content on our website and undertake internal research.

We prohibit web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to access your personal information. We may allow third parties to compile individual information or aggregated statistics from the use of web beacons on Dell.com by Dell, its agents or others, to enable such third parties to determine the effectiveness of online marketing and to allow such third parties to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site. Aggregate information is anonymous and may include demographic and usage information. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with partners for this research. 

You can make some web beacons unusable by rejecting cookies.

#### Third-Party Websites and Services

Please be aware that other websites that may be accessed through our website may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those third-party websites linked to Dell.com are not covered by this privacy statement. We generally use the "" symbol to mark links that go to third party sites.

Please be aware that, in providing services on Dell's behalf, our business partners may collect personal information about you. 

#### Changes to Our Privacy Statement Regarding Customer and Online User Information

We will occasionally update this privacy statement. If we make changes to the Privacy Statement Regarding Customer and Online User Information or make any material changes to how Dell will use your personal information, we will revise the Privacy Statement to reflect such changes and revise the statement's effective date, included at the end of this section. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how Dell is protecting your personal information.
