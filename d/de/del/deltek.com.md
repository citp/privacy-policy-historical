We are committed to processing your information in accordance with international legal standards, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection laws and data protection codes of conduct. We have implemented the practices set out in this Privacy Policy for our website and dependent pages (the "Site").

This policy addresses our privacy practices relating to visitors to the Site and registered users of the Site.

**III. Collection and Use of Personal Information**

Generally, you may browse the Site without providing any Personal Information. However, we may ask that you provide information, including, without limitation, Personal Information, at various times and locations through the Site. For example, if you decide to register with the Site to request information, you will be asked to provide information such as your name and email address. When using forms on the Site to communicate with us, you may choose to provide other Personal Information, such as your name, company name, mailing address, phone number, and email address. We may collect and store any Personal Information you input into the Site. 

The Personal Information collected by and through the Site may be used by Deltek, its divisions, holding companies, subsidiaries and affiliates, or other entities that are involved in the operation of the Site. We may use the information collected and provided, individually or in an aggregate form, in order to:

  * compare and otherwise use data entered by users for any purpose including consulting, research and marketing;
  * customize any advertising and content you see on the Site;
  * provide specific information to you from us and/or our affiliates; and
  * send you promotional material from us and/or our affiliates.



We do not sell Personal Information about you to unrelated companies for their independent use. 

**IV. Disclosures/Onward Transfers of Personal Information**

Deltek discloses your Personal Information to those who reasonably need to know such data for a legitimate business purpose and as required by law to Deltek subsidiaries, third parties, and business partners. By using Deltek websites, products, and solutions, or by providing your Personal Information to Deltek, you consent to the potential transfer, processing, and storage of such information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different than your own. 

Deltek requires our business partners, service vendors, authorized agents, and contractors to whom such disclosures are made to abide by confidentiality obligations. Absent your consent, Deltek will disclose your Personal Information only to service providers and their contractors who perform tasks on Deltek's behalf, provided that such service providers and/or contractors either: (a) comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield principles regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information from the European Union or use another mechanism permitted by EU data protection laws and the applicable laws of other countries that impose international data transfer restrictions; or (b) agree to provide adequate protections for your privacy interests that are no less protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy and to use the Personal Information only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Deltek. 

Deltek’s business partners are independent third parties that are otherwise not affiliated with Deltek. Any relationship a customer elects to enter into with a partner for products and services is directly between the respective customer and partner. 

Any Personal Information that you provide to us will be used for our purposes only. Personal Information will not be shared with individuals or other companies other than those referred to in this Privacy Policy. 

In some instances, however, we may need to provide Personal Information to third parties that we use to deliver specific products or services to you (such as shipping or direct mailing organizations). In such cases, our agreements with these third parties do not permit them to use Personal Information for purposes other than fulfilling those services or allow such third parties to further disclose your Personal Information.

We collect the domain names and IP addresses of our visitors for statistical purposes, to measure use, to improve the content or responsiveness of the Site, or to customize the content or layout of the Site for the individual visitor. We do not disclose this information to third parties. We may also aggregate information relating to our visitors' traffic patterns from the data that we collect and retain concerning the IP addresses and domain names of our visitors, and we may divulge such aggregate information about our users with third parties such as our business partners, distributors, and service and support providers. 

Data entered on the Site may be transferred to, and processed, on servers located in the countries in which we operate. Your data may be used by Deltek and its divisions, holding companies, subsidiaries and affiliates, or other entities outside the EU and the EEA including in the U.S. Please note that in countries outside the country in which you live, and in particular outside the EU/EEA, a different standard of data protection might apply than the standard that you are used to in your own country. By completing and submitting the contact form on our website, you acknowledge and consent that data will be transferred across international borders, including to countries outside the EU/EEA. Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize Deltek to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States, Ireland, and any other country where we operate. In some of these countries, the privacy and data protection law and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those of the country in which you reside. 

The Site may contain links to other third-party sites. When you click on one of these links you are visiting a website operated by someone other than us and the operator of that website may have a different privacy policy. We are not responsible for their individual privacy practices, so we encourage you to investigate the privacy policies of such third-party operators. 

**V. Sensitive Data**

"Sensitive Data" is data that pertains to a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, income records, health, sexual orientation, or alleged commission of any offense. Deltek does not solicit Sensitive Data and, except as required by law, will not disclose Sensitive Data to any third party. Further, Deltek will not use your Sensitive Data for any purpose other than (1) for the purpose for which you originally provided it, (2) for a purpose you later expressly consented to, or (3) where necessary to fulfill Deltek’s legal obligations. 

**VI. Confidentiality and Security of Data**

We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information when you transmit it from your computer to the Site and to protect such information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on this site, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.

While every effort and measure is taken to reduce the risk of data breaches, we have dedicated controls and procedures in place for such situations, along with the procedures that are required to make notifications to the relevant Supervisory Authority and data subjects (where applicable). 

**VII. Right to Access, Change or Delete Data**

If you want us to correct your Personal Information or other information, or if you would like us to provide you with a copy of the Personal Information that we hold about you, or if you would like the Personal Information that we hold about you to be erased, please contact us by sending us an email at [privacy@deltek.com](mailto:privacy@deltek.com) or writing to us at Deltek, Inc., ATTN: Privacy Policy Inquiry, Herndon, Virginia 20171. We will endeavor to respond to any such requests within 30 days of receipt.

For California Users: California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits Site visitors who are California residents and who have provided us with "personal information" (as that term is defined in Section 1798.83) to request certain information about the disclosure of that information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, you may contact us by writing to: Deltek, Attn: Privacy Policy Inquiry, 2291 Wood Oak Drive, Herndon, Virginia 20171. 

For Canadian Users: Canadian citizens, except under circumstances defined by law, are entitled to access their own personal data collected by Deltek by writing to: Deltek, Attn: Privacy Policy Inquiry, 2291 Wood Oak Drive, Herndon, Virginia 20171. If you believe that the personal data about you that we have collected is incomplete or inaccurate, please contact us and we will correct the information upon verification of the omission or error and of the identity of the person requesting the change. 

Personal Information will be stored for as long as the information is required to fulfill our legitimate business needs or the purposes for which the Personal Information was collected, or for such period as is required by law.

Deltek uses cookies (small text files placed on your device) and similar technologies to enhance our websites and online services and help collect data.

Deltek uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, depending on the product, including:

**X. E-Mail Addresses**

You should know that e-mail is not necessarily secure against all forms of interception. If your communication includes sensitive information about your company and you would prefer not to transmit this information in this fashion, please contact us by post or telephone rather than e-mail. 

We collect email addresses that are: volunteered by the visitor; through e-mail messages addressed to us or our employees; through visitor responses via the "contact us" portion of the Site; or e-mail marketing destination web pages and public events. We use e-mail addresses for marketing purposes and to inform those interested in our products about events, products, services or other items of interest. We may also use e-mail addresses volunteered by our visitors to register the visitor for an extranet account, to process orders for brochures and other written materials, or otherwise to respond to a visitor's request. 

On the Site we will ask you to consent to being contacted by us for promotional and marketing purposes. However, you may opt-out of receiving promotional or marketing emails at any time by notifying us as a reply to any unwanted e-mail, by using the unsubscribe function in our newsletter, contacting us at [privacy@deltek.com](mailto:privacy@deltek.com), or by writing to us at Deltek, Attn: Privacy Policy Inquiry, 2291 Wood Oak Drive, Herndon, Virginia 20171. Requests to unsubscribe from Deltek e-mails may take 5 business days to process.
