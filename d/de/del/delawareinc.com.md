Every effort to secure your data against criminal outside disclosure is being taken over the internet. Every name and address in our database is initially and periodically checked against the U.S. Treasury Department's SDN list.

We will not sell, rent, lease or share your personal information with any third party without your express permission and as otherwise described in this privacy policy.

Our records are password protected by biometric finger print scanners and monitored by security personnel on site. Your data is monitored by a 16-camera infrared system, backed up by independent propane power supplies, generators and a state of the art, digitally-controlled power management system. Your records are stored in secure facilities with 24-hour surveillance and, in case of a regional disaster, we can start servicing your requests within 48 hours at our location of choice.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

**Your California Privacy Right**

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
