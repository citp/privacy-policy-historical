      <h1> Privacy and Information Practices </h1>
      
      <div id="withoutLeft_page_content">    
<p>Throughout our existence, Deluxe Corporation ("Deluxe") has been a trusted custodian of sensitive consumer data. Financial services companies and consumers rely on that trust. The operating subsidiaries of Deluxe created a formal privacy policy in 1997 to ensure that the clients and customers of Deluxe understand our commitment to protecting consumer privacy.</p>

<p>Deluxe's privacy policies reflect our commitment to respond to the changing needs and concerns of consumers, financial services companies, and regulators. Most importantly, Deluxe is committed to maintaining the high standards and reputation for privacy and the trust we have earned since our formation in 1915.</p>

<p>Deluxe Corporation owns several businesses. Each business serves customers who have specific and unique privacy concerns, and each business has implemented a privacy policy that reflects the applicable legal requirements and customer expectations for that business. Regardless of the business model, each of the Deluxe companies has built its privacy policy around the following guiding principles:</p>

<h2>Guiding Principles of Privacy</h2>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong> - A commitment to use reasonable procedures to ensure that information collected, used, and exchanged will be accurate and complete</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong> - A commitment to use appropriate security measures for protecting information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure</p>

<p><strong>Compliance</strong> - A commitment to collect, use, and exchange data in accordance with applicable laws and contractual obligations</p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> - A commitment to collect, use, and exchange information in accordance with appropriate confidentiality standards</p>

<p><strong>Privacy</strong> - A commitment to self-regulation in recognition of expectations of privacy, our policy and in accordance with leading industry standards</p>

<p><strong>Responsiveness</strong> - A commitment to respond to privacy-related inquiries in a timely and accurate manner</p>

<p><strong>Employee education</strong> - A commitment to educate employees regarding information practices and the proper handling and use of information</p>

<p><strong>Self-auditing</strong> - A commitment to periodic auditing of internal activities to ensure adherence to established information practices, policies, and procedures</p>
