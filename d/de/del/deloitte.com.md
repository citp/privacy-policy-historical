**Information Collection**

As a visitor, you do not have to submit any personal information in order to use the Web site. The site collects only personally identifiable information that is specifically and voluntarily provided by visitors.  Such information may consist of, but is not limited to, your name, current job title, company address, email address and telephone and fax numbers.

We do not usually seek sensitive information (e.g., data relating to race or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, criminal record, physical or mental health, or sexual orientation) from visitors.  We will, where necessary, obtain visitors’ explicit consent to collect and use such information.

We use a “cookie” to facilitate improved navigation within the site.  The cookie expires after the visitor  leaves the Web site. Cookies are small text files stored in a user's browser.  If you are concerned about cookies and do not wish to receive them, you may set your Internet browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.  You can then decide to either accept or reject it. However, under specific circumstances, visitors may be denied access to some parts of our site if their browsers reject cookies.

To ensure that our Web site is well managed, we or our service provider may track information on our systems and identify categories of visitors by items such as domain and browser type. This information is reported to our webmasters who use the information to analyze the number of visitors to different areas of the site to make sure that our Web site is serving as a useful and effective information source.

  
**Information Use**  
Personal information is used only for limited purposes. For example, when you register with the Web site to gain access to premium content or request future communications about Deloitte areas of interest, such as specific Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu or member firm publications or marketing campaigns, we may use the information you submit to create a personal profile to customize our response to further requests or inquiries. We may also use the information to personalize your Web site experience. And, when you choose to register online for a Deloitte-hosted event, we will use the information you submit to respond to you. In addition, the web masters may, where necessary, use your information for various site related tasks. We will ensure that our marketing activities comply with applicable law, and implement procedures to obtain necessary consents before sending you emails containing information about Deloitte service offerings. You may at any time request that we discontinue sending you such materials.

  
**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

Although we may provide visitors’ information to service providers that handle information on our behalf, we will usually not share the information with third parties or other Deloitte entities for secondary or unrelated purposes unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection.

Personal information may be transmitted internationally through the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu worldwide organization or to third parties for the purposes identified above. This may include transfer to countries without data protection rules similar to those in effect in a visitor’s country of residence. By providing information to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu through this Web site, you are consenting to such transfers. Where appropriate, personal information may be disclosed to law enforcement, regulatory or other government agencies, or third parties where necessary or desirable to comply with legal or regulatory obligations or requests or for the purposes identified above.

  
**Access to Information**

We are dedicated to providing reasonable access to visitors who wish to review the personal information retained when they register with our Web site and correct any inaccuracies it may contain.  Visitors who choose to register may access their user profile, correct and update their details, or unsubscribe at any time.  Visitors who have any problem accessing their profiles, or would like to request a copy of their personal information should contact Webmaster Services using the Contact Us link.  In all cases we will treat requests to access information or change information in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

We have in place reasonable commercial standards of technology and operational  
security to protect all information provided by visitors from loss, misuse, alteration or  
destruction.
