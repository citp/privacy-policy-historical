**Collection and Use of Information**

In some areas of the site, "cookies" are used to collect information about viewers' browsing habits in order to customize services. Cookies are small text files stored in a user's browser and are not used to track the identity of or to store personal data about individual users. If you are concerned about cookies and do not wish to receive a cookie from [http://www.deloitte.com](http://www.deloitte.com/) or any other Web site, you may set your Internet browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can then decide to either accept or reject it. However, on certain occasions or under specific circumstances, access to an area of our site, or to some parts of it, may be denied to users if their browsers reject cookies.

In order to ensure that our Web site is well managed, we may anonymously log information on our operational systems and identify categories of visitors only by items such as domains and browser types. Such statistics are reported in the aggregate to our webmasters who use this information to measure number of visitors to different areas of our site to make certain that our Web site is as useful and effective an information source as it can be.

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu receives very little personal information from visitors to our Web site and only for a limited set of purposes. In general, personal or identifying information may be collected as registration data for certain areas of the site, in order to enable us to respond to certain inquiries for further information, to distribute requested materials, or when visitors decide to submit resumes. Such personal information may consist of, but is not limited to the following: name, address, current job title, phone and/or fax numbers, and email address. Additional demographic information is not actively sought, but may be obtained when a visitor submits a resume as a part of an online job application. It is Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu's policy not to seek any sensitive information (e.g., data relating to race or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, criminal record, physical or mental health, or sexual orientation) from visitors to our Web site, unless legally required to do so for recruiting or hiring purposes. We do not suggest that you provide sensitive information. However, if you do provide such information, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu accepts your explicit consent to use that data in the ways described in this privacy statement or in the ways described at the point where such information is disclosed.

It is possible for a visitor to send emails through the site, and such messages will contain the user's name and email address, as well as additional information that the user may wish to include in his or her messages. Because our Web site can be used to recruit prospective employees, a user's visit to our site may involve a user sending a resume to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu limits the information collected from visitors to only the minimum information required to fulfill a visitor's request or order. Where non-mandatory data is sought, the visitor will be notified that such information is not a necessity at the time of collection of such data. Although most publications that are available to visitors through our Web site are provided by downloading, visitors may have the option to purchase Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu publications either online, by calling toll-free phone numbers, or by faxing order forms. In the event that a visitor wishes to purchase a publication, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu will collect the order information that may include credit card information in order to facilitate payment for and shipment of the publication. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu will not use personal data to facilitate unsolicited marketing activities.
