Users can access the Deputy application (the “Application”) through our website www.deputy.com, subdomain (*.deputy.com), through applications on devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “Device” is any computer used to access the Deputy Application, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.
