PRIVACY POLICY
Personal information collected
The DPS collects the information you are asked to provide during your registration with The DPS or which you

Cookies
A cookie is very small text ﬁle which a website transfers to your computer’s hard drive. This allows the website
to recognise that you have visited on a previous occasion, and to automatically restore any preferences that
you may have already set. Only the website that originally posted the cookie can retrieve it. This type of cookie
is semi-permanent, typically having a lifespan of around 3 months. After this time, the cookie expires and is
automaticallyremoved from your computer.
The DPS does not use semi-permanent cookies. It does, however, use what is known as a session cookie. A session
cookie is a standard technique used by many web sites to temporarily store a unique ID on a user’s computer for
the duration of the time you are viewing the web site. This session ID allows the website to maintain continuity
throughout your visit (e.g. keeping you logged-in). Session cookies do not identify you personally and are
deleted when the web browser is closed.
Please note that the websites to which this site may be linked may make use of their own cookies to collect

Security precautions
The DPS employs appropriate technical security measures to protect your personal information and to ensure
that it is not accessed by unauthorised persons. Information is held on secure servers and is encrypted wherever

merchandise online. Our security procedures also provide that, in addition to any password which you may require
to gain access to The Deposit Protection Service, you may have to provide proof of identiﬁcation before we will
release personal information to you. Multiple incorrect attempts or invalidation will result in a lockout from the
information. We undergo independent periodic reviews of our security policies and procedures to ensure that our
systems are secure and protected. You should never divulge your identiﬁcation numbers, username, or password
to anyone else. You should also never write your password down or store it on your computer.
