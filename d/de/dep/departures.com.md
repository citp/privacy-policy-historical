In this policy, we also explain how we may combine Online Information and Other Information we collect from you and how we then use the combined information. 

##   
What information do we collect and how do we collect it?

The types of information we collect depends on which product or service you use.

Sometimes you give information directly to us (or to our Service Providers). For example, you might give us your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, date of birth and credit or debit card information in order to:

  * Subscribe to or purchase any of our products or services, such as our publications or club memberships;

We (and our Service Providers or Third-Party Ad-Servers) also may collect information made publicly available through third-party platforms (such as social media sites), online databases or other directories. 

## How do we use the information we collect about you?

## Your California Privacy Rights: Notice to California Customers

California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. (Note: TIAMG sites do not recognize the "do not track signals" that some browsers may employ.) As discussed above, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes offline please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20141123061454id_/http%3A//www.departures.com/promo/optout/amgoffline/), or for email please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20141123061454id_/http%3A//www.departures.com/promo/optout/amgemail/). To find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact us as described in the "How to Contact Us" section below.

Some Online Information and Other Information is Personal Information, which is information that can identify a person, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, date of birth and credit or debit card information.

## How we treat your Personal Information

We do not share Personal Information with anyone except as described below. We may share Personal Information as required or as permitted by law, such as:

  * With regulatory authorities, courts, and governmental agencies to comply with legal orders, legal or regulatory requirements, and government requests;
  * With our Service Providers, regulatory authorities, and governmental agencies to detect and prevent fraud or criminal activity, and to protect the rights of TIAMG or others;
  * Within the other divisions of Time Inc. Affluent Media Group that share this privacy policy;
  * With our Service Providers who perform services for us and help us operate our business (we require Service Providers to safeguard Personal Information and only use your Personal Information for the purposes we specify);
  * With Business Partners who may wish to contact you about products, services, and offers that may interest you, either in conjunction with TIAMG or by themselves. These Business Partners' practices are not covered by this privacy policy. (If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with our Business Partners in the future, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20141123061454id_/http%3A//www.departures.com/promo/optout/bpoffline/).);
  * In the context of a sale of all or part of Time Inc. Affluent Media Group or or their assets; or
  * For specific products or services, when you have given your consent.
  * Also, we may transfer Personal Information to Service Providers or companies within the Time Inc. Affluent Media Group throughout the world, for example, to process transactions and provide you with our products or services. Regardless of where we process your information, we still protect it in the manner described in this privacy policy and according to the applicable laws.



## How we handle Aggregate and De-Identified Information

Aggregate Information or De-Identified Information does not identify you individually; it helps us to analyze patterns among groups of people. We may share Aggregate Information or De-Identified Information in several ways, for example:

  * For the same reasons as we might share Personal Information;
  * With Business Partners to help develop and market products and deliver targeted content and ads;
  * With Business Partners to conduct analysis and research about customers and site visitors; or
  * With Third-Party Ad-Servers to place ads (including ads of our Business Partners) on various sites and applications, and to analyze the effectiveness of those ads.



Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.

## How do we keep and safeguard your information?

We use administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and facilities. No system can be completely secure, however, and we do not guarantee that unauthorized disclosures and access will not happen.

We will keep your Online Information and Other Information as long as necessary to deliver our products and services, unless we are required by law or regulation or for litigation and regulatory investigations to keep it for a longer period of time.

## What are your choices?

You have choices about how TIAMG uses your information, such as how we market to you or how we manage Cookies or Similar Technologies[1].

## What are your choices about how we directly market to you?

You can choose how you would like to receive direct marketing communications - whether we send them to you through postal mail, email and/or telephone. If you choose to not receive marketing communications from us, we will honor your choice. Please be aware that if you choose not to receive such communications, certain offers attached to the products or services you have chosen may be affected. We will still communicate with you in connection with servicing your account, fulfilling your requests, or administering any promotion or any program in which you have elected to participate.

## Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors

Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. You should consult the other sites' and services' privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties or their use of your information.

TIAMG sites sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, promotions, editorial features, or other activities or offerings that are sponsored or co-sponsored by or presented with identified third parties. By virtue of your participation in such activities or offerings, your IP address and the personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit may be provided to both the TIAMG site and the third parties. TIAMG has no control over the third parties' use of this information.

## How we serve advertising

We use reputable third parties to serve advertisements, including Online Behavioral Advertisements, that you may see on the web pages and to conduct research about the advertisements. This privacy notice does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you (e.g., type of browser, operating system, domain name, day and time of visit, page(s) visited) or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs). 

For additional information on advertisements and your Online Behavioral Advertising options, visit our [About Ads page](http://www.amexpub.com/privacy/amg-behavioral.html) and our [Network Advertising Initiatives page](http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/html/legal/parties.html). 

## Accessing, Correcting, and Deleting Your Personal Information

We will take reasonable steps to accurately record the personal information that you provide to us and any subsequent updates.

We encourage you to review and update the personal information that we maintain about you, and you may request that we delete personal information about you that is inaccurate or incomplete by contacting us as described in the "How to Contact Us" section below. At our election, instead of deleting such information, we may retain it with your comment or correction noted in our records. Your right to review, update, correct and delete your information is subject to our records retention policies and applicable law, including any statutory retention requirements.
