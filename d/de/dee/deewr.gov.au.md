  * We may disclose your personal information to third parties in limited circumstances authorised under law, including the Privacy Act 1988 (eg, preventing fraud or imminent threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or another person, ensuring the security of DEEWR statutory functions, and protecting the public revenue).
