**What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small computer file. It typically consists of letters and numbers. When you visit a website, the website may send a cookie to your browser. Subsequently, the browser may store the cookie on your computer system. The main purpose of cookies is to allow a website to recognize user’s device. There are two types of cookies, namely, persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies remain valid until their expiration date, unless deleted by the user before that date. Session cookies will be stored on a web browser and will remain valid until the moment when the browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain personal data. However, personal data stored by us may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. Web servers can use cookies to (1) identify and track users while they navigate through different pages on a website; and (2) identify users returning to a website.

**What cookies do we use?**

We use both session and persistent cookies. We use session cookies, such as [“gads”, “ga”], in order to verify your details until you are navigating from page to page on the Website. The session cookies enable you to avoid re-entering your details each time you enter a new page on the Website. We use persistent cookies, such as [“gid”, “cfduid”], in order to recognize you as a unique user when you return to the Website. We will not use cookies for purposes, which are not mentioned in this Privacy Policy.

**Google Analytics**

We use Google Analytics to analyze your use of the Website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about the Website by means of cookies. The information generated by Google Analytics in relation to the Website is used to create reports about the use of the Website. We use the following Google Analytics advertising features: (i) Remarketing with Google Analytics; (ii) Google Display Network Impression Reporting; (iii) Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting; and (iv) Integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and identifiers.

If you would like to opt out from Google Analytics advertising features, you can do so through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (for example, the NAI’s consumer opt-out). You can also install a Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>.

Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to the Website. Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve you ads based on your visits to the Website and/or other websites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of personalized advertising by visiting <https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated>.

Third-party vendors that are certified by Google for third-party ads may serve ads on the Website. The names of such third party-vendors and links to their websites can be found at <https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/94149?hl=en>. You may visit those websites to opt out of the use of cookies for personalized advertising (if the vendor or ad network offers this capability).

**How to refuse cookies?**

If you do not agree to our use of cookies, you need to either (i) discontinue your use of the Website or (ii) set your browser to refuse cookies.
