# Privacy / Decide

## Last Updated: June, 16 2011

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used and disclosed by Decide Inc., and our subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, "Decide," "we" or "us"), with respect to your use of our websites, including www.decide.com, and our other online and mobile websites and applications (collectively, the "Sites"), and the Decide service offered through the Sites (the "Service").

We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.

### What Is Personal Information?

As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, email address or credit card number), or information about an individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

### What Personal Information Do We Collect?

_Active Collection:_ Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Sites. We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you create an account, sign up to receive email alerts or newsletters, provide or request information or participate in our surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers or other activities on our Sites. Such information may include your name, email address, postal address, telephone number and other contact or demographic information.

_Passive Collection:_ When you use the Sites, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, operating system, browser type, the address of a referring website and your activity on the Sites. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.

We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Sites and your experience. If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information. If you wish to block, erase or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services on our Sites.

In addition, we may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Site. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site, such as to count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

### What Information Do Third Parties Collect?

Third parties may serve ads on the Site or otherwise place cookies, web beacons or other tracking technologies on the Site to enable them to automatically collect nonpersonal information about you and your visits to the Site and to other websites, such as your IP address, your ISP, pages viewed and the browser you use to visit our Site. Information collected may be used, among other things, to analyze data, to deliver content and advertising on this or other sites (including content and advertising that is targeted to your interests), to determine the popularity of certain content, to make recommendations and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other websites tracked by these third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or other tracking technologies in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn more about their use of cookies and other technologies. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices as it relates to ad networks, please visit www.networkadvertising.org.

If you participate in any interactive features on the Sites, you understand that information you post in any forums, comments, listings, groups or other interactive areas of the Sites, as well as any information you share with individuals through the Sites or share through social network sites or other social feeds, will be available to other users and in some cases may be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious about giving out personal information to others or sharing personal information in public or private online forums.

We are not responsible for the actions of service providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to any third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing information directly to any such parties. Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregated or anonymized information, which may be shared with third parties without your consent.

### Links to Other Websites

This Policy does not apply to such linked sites, and we are not responsible for the privacy and security practices and policies of these websites. We encourage you to learn about the privacy and security practices and policies before providing linked sites with personal information.

### What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information Online?

We implement a variety of security measures to help protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
