Straight Talk on Decidio's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy

Decidio is committed to the responsible management of consumer information. Decidio absolutely does not sell or rent your personal information to companies that make or distribute marketing lists. 

At Decidio, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit Decidio on the Web and conduct a limited amount of searches without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as when you are creating or logging into an account with us. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet. 

If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners may need -- to correspond with you, pre-fill search fields, or assist you in any way -- it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. We may keep track of the domains from which people visit us so we can analyze the data for trends and statistics. 

If you are using Decidio to search for local vendors that provide the goods or services you might need, those same local vendors you research may contact you via email with special offers or discounts soon after your search, in effect showing you how much they want your business. 

The Decidio website contains links to other Web sites. Decidio is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

There is a technology called "cookies" which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Web site. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Some Decidio pages (such as our search area) use cookies so that we can better serve you when you return to our site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. 

Each of the documents linked below outline the type of information we collect and store, our usage policy, and who to contact with questions or concerns.
