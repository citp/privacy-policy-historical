## Why we collect personal information

DecalGirl collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest service, special offers, and other information we think you'd like to hear about. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you in regards to keeping you updated of new DecalGirl products, artists, designs and special offers., If you no longer wish to receive these types of email communications you may opt-out at anytime. Please see the choice/opt-out section below.

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). 

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

## How We Collect Personal Information

We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, or participate in an online survey. In addition, when you complete your online order, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database.

To save you time and make our web services even easier to use, some areas of the DecalGirl website allow you to create a "DecalGirl User Account" using your personal information. Here's how it works: Simply fill out a brief profile: your name and email address; then choose a password for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal DecalGirl User Account. Next time you order something from DecalGirl, you can simply enter your email address and password and the system will automatically look up the information it needs.

## When We Disclose Personal Information

We use other third parties such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf and a third party marketing provider to provide broadcast email services for us.
