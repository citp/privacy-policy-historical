Decider.com (“Decider.com” or “we”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications (“apps”), and widgets (collectively, the “Decider.com Services”). By using the Decider.com Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. A list of our affiliated companies (“Decider.com Affiliates”) is available at <a href=&quot;http://newscorp.com/about/our-businesses/&quot;>http://newscorp.com/about/our-businesses/</a>.As set forth in our <a title=&quot;Terms of Use&quot; href=&quot;http://decider.com/terms/&quot;>Terms of Use</a>, the Decider.com Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Decider.com Services without being registered with or subscribing to an Decider.com Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to an Decider.com Service.

This Privacy Policy applies to Decider.com’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address). It also describes generally Decider.com’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).

Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code and birthday.Public Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the Decider.com Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.

Information from Social Media. If you access or log-in to an Decider.com Service through a social media service or connect an Decider.com Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Decider.com Services through social media services or when you connect an Decider.com Service to social media services, you are authorizing Decider.com to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Decider.com Services, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.

Third parties that support the Decider.com Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Decider.com Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.
