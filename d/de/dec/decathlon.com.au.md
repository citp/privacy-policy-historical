  *         employment details if you send us a CV, resumé or other details of your employment history in connection with an advertised job vacancy or a general enquiry regarding employment opportunities with us.



You are under no obligation to provide any such information and may deal with us or visit the Site anonymously or by pseudonym. However, if you should choose to withhold certain requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.  For example, we may not be able to process a purchase order you have made on the Site or we may be unable to assist you in setting up an account on the Site. 

We may, from time to time, run referral programmes or similar initiatives, such as a "Tell a Friend" programme, that invite you to provide us with the contact details of someone who is known to you who may find our products or services to be of interest. We will only use those contact details for the purpose of the relevant initiative (and not for general marketing purposes). By providing us with their details, you confirm that you have their permission to do so and must not provide us with the details of anyone from whom you do not have such permission. We reserve the right to identify you as the person who has made the referral in the message that is sent to them.

You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on the Site, monitoring and analysing website traffic on our Site, improving the functionality and features of our Site and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.

We may collect this non-personal information through the use of cookies or other similar technologies.  A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer.  When you visit our Site, your web browser may store cookies on your computer, which will be retrieved when you next visit the Site in order to store your preferences and provide you with a better and personalised experience in using our Site.  These cookies do not contain or collect personal information but allows us to analyse your preferences on our Site such as how often you visit the Site and your preferred webpages on our Site, in order for us to enhance your customer experience of the Site.  You may delete or prevent cookies from being saved on your computer by changing your internet browser settings to prevent the use of, or remove, cookies.  You may still use the Site even if you choose to reject or delete cookies.  However, please be aware that if you reject or delete the cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of certain features on our Site.

Any such communications you receive will be sent by us. In determining what we think may be of interest to you, we will consider all such information which you provide to us.

## DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION OVERSEAS  


We may also disclose your personal information to overseas recipients for the purposes of conducting our business.  For example, we may share the information collected from you with our parent company, Decathlon France SA, registered in France, Lille, RCS 306 138 900 and our other related companies or affiliates. Decathlon France SA and its subsidiaries own a number of brands, and your personal information may be shared or accessed via Decathlon SA, with these brands.  A full list of Decathlon France SA’s brands can be seen here: [http://corporate.decathlon.com/en/our-brands/passion-brands](http://corporate.decathlon.com/en/our-brands/passion-brands). 

We may also transfer your personal information to overseas recipients who may assist us in the processing, storage or analysis of your information (for example third party cloud storage service providers), processing of credit card payments or provide technical or website support to us.  For example, your personal information may be sent to and stored on secure servers which are necessary to process the information, located in China, France, or Ireland. See Storage of Your Information below.

Countries outside of Australia may not always have the same or similar privacy and data protection laws as Australia and, in some cases, foreign law may require us to disclose your personal information overseas, for example to an overseas law enforcement authority. Please be aware that you may not be able to seek redress for a breach of privacy in a country outside of Australia.  However, where we do provide your personal information to third parties, Decathlon will take such steps as reasonable to ensure your information is used in accordance with this policy.

 **Important Notice**

In the event that the processing of your personal information involves the disclosure of any information outside Australia, you acknowledge that, by providing us with your personal information, you consent to such overseas disclosure. By consenting to such disclosure, you acknowledge that:

  1. Decathlon will not be accountable under the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth) for any breach of your privacy by the overseas recipient, and 
  2. You will not be able to seek redress under the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth) against Decathlon for any breach of your privacy by an overseas recipient.



## STORAGE OF YOUR INFORMATION

Information that you submit via the Site will only be stored for as long as we legitimately need it or as required by the law. This information is sent to and stored on secure servers which are necessary in order to process the information. These are located within China, France, and Ireland. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see Information Sharing), which may be situated outside Australia and may be processed by staff operating outside Australia. The countries concerned may not have similar data protection laws to the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles. For example, your personal information may be disclosed in China or in the European Economic Area.  Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.
