**With whom we share personal information?**

From time to time, we may disclose personal information to third parties, as follows:

**Business Partners  **\- We may team up with other companies ("business partners") to offer certain promotions, jointly sponsor and promote such promotions, and develop subsites or separate websites that are used for a promotion. If you decide to participate in one of these promotions, the personal information that is collected from the relevant subsite will be collected by both Decathlon and the business partner(s) participating in the promotion. We will use that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and our business partner will use it in accordance with its own privacy policy. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of our business partners.

**Service Providers**  \- We may engage certain third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, storage, database management, credit card processing, shipping, fraud prevention, business analytics, chat, website analytics, website optimization, lead scoring, retargeting, direct marketing campaign and the sending of newsletters, or similar services.

We will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your personal information.

**To Defend or Enforce our Rights**  \- We may use or share personal information to protect Decathlon or protect the Website, to establish or exercise our legal rights, respond to a breach of our Website Terms of Use, when we believe it is appropriate to protect the property and rights of Decathlon or a third party, the safety of our company, our customers or others, to investigate, prevent, take action against, or stop any fraudulent, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, in connection with our Website, or other products the Decathlon Website Terms of Use, or other agreements. 

**Business Transfers**  \- If any or all of the assets of Decathlon are acquired by, or merged with those of another entity, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we may disclose, share or transfer some or all of our users' personal information to or with this entity in preparation of the transaction, as part of the due diligence, or after the transaction has been consummated, so that the successor entity can continue providing our services to our users.

Please note that we may not be able to notify you of a request for the disclosure of your information as described above, because doing so might be prohibited by law, or because doing so would jeopardize an investigation into illegal or fraudulent activity, or because we do not have your contact information. 

**Aggregate Information**  \- We may prepare reports, market analysis, and trend analysis that are based on compilation of data that Decathlon has collected.

This aggregated information is used for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes. 

**Cookies and other technologies**

We use cookies and other technologies as described below to gather information about the users of our Website, in order to know what information is or might be of interest to them. All personal information collected through cookies is processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

Cookies \- Some cookies are managed by us, and others by our service providers, such as when we display advertisements on third parties websites. These cookies are used for a variety of purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. 

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, or service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

Some cookies enable services that you have specifically asked for, while other cookies are used to remember the choices you made (for example, the size of the font, or the language you prefer) in order to make it easier for you to use our Website when you return. 

Other cookies collect information about how users use our Website, for example which pages they visit most often, or how long they stay on a particular page. 

Finally, other cookies are used to collect information about your perceived interest in our products so that we can arrange for advertisements regarding these products to display on other sites that you visit on the Internet.

When users visit the Website, we may store a number or code in their browsers using one or several cookies to remember their visit. This unique number or code identifies a browser on a specific computer. Browsers may be associated with demographic information, such as gender or age range, based on the other websites that were visited by that browser. 

Tags \- Our Website site may also use tags (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web beacons), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a webpage. 

We use tags to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve Website performance. We also may allow our service providers to use tags to analyze visitor traffic and actions on our Website and to help us understand which pages are more attractive to Users, or which emails have been opened by recipients. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.

**California Disclosures**

**Do Not Track**  – California law requires that operators of websites disclose how they respond to a “Do Not Track” signal.

We will continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals. 

**Third Party Cookies**  \- California law requires that operators of websites disclose whether third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual’s online activities. We allow third parties with whom we have a separate agreement to use cookies or other technologies to collect information about users visit to our Website. These third parties include business partners, which may collect information when you view or interact with certain areas of this Website, and advertising networks, which may collect information about your interests or preferences, so that they can display promotional material on this Website, or across the Internet tailored to your apparent interest.
