# Data privacy at devolo - devolo AG

devolo AG takes protection of your personal data very seriously. We would like you to know when and what data we collect and how we use it. We have introduced technical and organisational measures that ensure compliance with the regulations on data protection by us as well as by external service providers.

In the course of updates of our web pages and the implementation of new technologies to improve our service for you, changes to this data protection declaration can be necessary. We therefore recommend you read this data protection declaration again from time to time.

### What are personal data?

Personal data is information that could be used to identify personal or factual information about you. Information that could not be used to identify you (or only with a disproportionate level of effort) is not classed as personal data (e.g. data that has been pseudonymised or anonymised).

### Does devolo AG use cookies?

devolo AG uses three different types of "cookies" (small files containing configuration information). The first type is used to maintain your session if you change pages, the second to protect the integrity of your session and the third to recognise you in the case of revisits. The first two types are not stored and expire after a maximum time of 120 minutes for registered users or a maximum time of 20 minutes for unregistered visitors or if you close your browser. The third type is valid for a period of 2 years and is renewed upon each visit. In some cases selected partners use anonymised cookies although these cannot be used for identification of the individual user. You can also use our services without cookies. Most browsers are pre-configured to allow cookies automatically. However, you can deactivate the acceptance of cookies or set the browser to alert you before cookies are stored. We would like to point out that you will not be able to use all our website features if you decline feature-related cookies.

### Are your data forwarded to third parties?

To comply with legal requirements, we are obliged in certain cases to forward your personal data to third parties. This is the case, for example, if there is suspicion of a criminal offence or misuse of our website. In this case we are obliged to forward your data to the law enforcement agencies. Otherwise your data is stored solely in our database and on our servers. This does not apply to our service partners who require data for order handling such as Deutsche Post, UPS, GLS, DPD, DHL or our banks. In these cases personal data is transferred in compliance with the statutory regulations of the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG, Federal Data Protection Act). The amount of data transferred is limited to the minimum required.

### Security precautions for protection of the data we store

Any data which we collect is stored on servers in Germany which are especially protected. Only a few persons who are responsible for the technical, commercial or editorial administration are authorised to access these servers. To avoid any loss or misuse of data stored at devolo AG, we take extensive technical and internal security precautions which are reviewed on a regular basis and updated in line with technical progress. However, we wish to point out that the rules of data protection and the above mentioned security measures may be violated by persons or institutions beyond the scope of our responsibility due to the structure of the internet. In particular data which is sent unencrypted – including by e-mail – can be read by third parties. We do not have any technical influence on such actions. The user himself is responsible for protecting any data provided against misuse by means of encryption or any other method. Our online service contains links to other websites. We have no influence on whether these providers comply with the data protection regulations.

### Your right to information, rectification, blocking and deletion

In compliance with the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG, Federal Data Protection Act) you have the right to information as well as the right to rectification, blocking and deletion of your personal data. If deletion conflicts with any legal, contractual, commercial or fiscal record retention periods or with any other legally binding reasons, the data may be blocked instead of deleted.

### Revocation of consent

Where applicable you have explicitly given your consent to the following. We would like to point out that you can revoke your consent at any time, effective immediately and for the future. Content of the consent to e-mails regarding orders and customer: "We will use this e-mail address to send you the order confirmation, and, until cancelled, messages regarding its dispatch and the package number, information on potential delays, as well as occasional customer care information." Content of the consent to e-mail advertisements by newsletter: "Yes! I would like devolo AG to inform me about promotions, vouchers and offers until cancelled by e-mail."

### Which data do we collect and process?

You can use part of our online service without revealing your identity. However, if you want to place an order we will ask you to supply your name and other personal information. This may also apply if you want to participate in one of our competitions and your data is needed to inform you if you have won or to ensure that you get your prize. You can decide yourself whether or not to provide these data. However, without this information we will be unable to offer you the service you require or the service may be available only to a limited extent. In the process of retrieving your desired information our servers store data for service delivery or security purposes, which may enable you to be identified (for instance IP address, date, time and pages visited). These are deleted as soon as they are no longer required.

### For what purpose does devolo AG use your data?

We store and use your personal data including your home address and e-mail address exclusively for processing your orders and for any possible return consignment. We store your IP address together with an order only for a legitimate request. We use your e-mail address solely for sending information regarding the orders and – providing you have given your approval, for customer service – and also for our own newsletters, if you wish. Information is retrieved and used pseudonymously to manage and optimise product offers and sales promotions on our website. However, we reserve the right to carry out statistical evaluations of pseudonymous and anonymous data records for example for system security reasons (to prevent misuse), to improve the website and for statistical purposes; you may object to this storage at any time by deleting your online customer account. Apart from the above, your data will be only processed and used for other purposes if you agree explicitly to the intended use, e.g. if you wish to participate in our competitions or join the devolo AG bonus and partner programme.

### Protection of minors

Persons under the age of 18 years should not transfer any personal data to us without the consent of their parents or guardian. We do not request personal data from children and teenagers. We do not consciously collect any such data or transfer it to third parties.

### Google Analytics

By visiting the devolo AG website, data regarding access can be saved to the server (date, time, pages viewed). These data are not defined as personal data and are instead anonymous. Such data are evaluated solely for statistical purposes. 

This website uses Google Analytics, a Web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

devolo AG expressly warns that inherent security gaps may exist with regard to the transmission of data over the Internet (e.g. by e-mail), and that data cannot be protected with 100% security from unauthorised access. The use of the service provider's identifying contact data—in particular the telephone/fax numbers and e-mail addresses—for commercial advertisement is expressly undesired without prior written authorisation from devolo AG or unless a business relationship is already in existence. devolo AG reserves the right to take legal measures in the case of infringement.
