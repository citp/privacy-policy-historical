         	Privacy Policy 
        </h1>
	<p>
	We do not sell, trade, etc. any of the information you enter on this site during registration process. This information is only used to provide basic functionality such as maintaining ownerships of the postings. 
        </p>
        <p>
			You do not need to authenticate in order to utilize most of the functionality of this site. However, you are asked to create an account in order to post information on this site. This will enable you to edit/delete information you posted. In fact, this is the only benefit of the registration process.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Creating an account merely requires choosing a username/password combination. Your password gets encrypted before being stored in our database. One-way hash is used to perform this encryption which means that nobody (including the administrator of this site) has access to your sensitive information.
        </p>
        <p>
			You do not have to provide your email address during the registration process. The only purpose for providing one, is for you to be able to recover your password in case you forget one. 
        </p>
        <p>
			The site utilizes session cookies in order to provide access to the data retrieved from the database by different pages during your browser session. Such cookies only exist for the duration of your browser session. 
        </p>
	<h2>Terms of Use</h2>
	<p>
	It is illegal to harvest email addresses and/or personal information of the site's users (whether it's done in a manual or an automated way) for any purpose other than (a) contacting employers to apply for positions they advertised, (b) contacting developers/companies to discuss your available opportunities. Any violators will be reported and/or mentioned on this site in a VERY negative context.
