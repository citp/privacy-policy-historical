Notification of Changes   
We are continually improving and adding new functionality and features to this website and improving and adding to our existing products, services, and programs. Because of these ongoing changes, changes in the law, and the changing nature of technology, our data practices will change from time to time. If and when such data practices change, we will post the changes on this website to notify you of the changes. We encourage you to check this page frequently. This Privacy Policy was last updated on January 15, 2004.  
Information Collected  
In the course of operating this website, Mobile Complete may collect two types of information about its users: Personal Information and Anonymous Information. 

“Personal Information” is personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, title, phone number, and company name. Personal Information is collected by us only when you choose to provide it to us, such as when you use this website to signup with Mobile Complete, or use this website to contact Mobile Complete with questions and comments. In addition, if you choose to contact any of our customer service representatives, we may keep a record of that correspondence to fully address the subject matter. 

In addition to the information you provide when you use our website, we use technology to collect “Anonymous Information” about the use of our website. For example, we use technology to track how many visitors access our website, the date and time of their visit, the length of their stay, and which pages they view. We also use technology to determine which web browsers our visitors use and the address from which they accessed our website. 

This technology does not identify you personally. It simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our website. Mobile Complete uses this anonymous data and shares it with third parties to improve the content and functionality of our website, to better understand our customers and markets, and to improve our products and services.

Cookies  
A “cookie” is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser when you access a website. This data is stored on your computer’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Cookies cannot be used to discover the identity of a user. 

Mobile Complete uses cookies to facilitate and enhance your experience on our website, such as to give your direct access to our Downloads section after you have entered your contact information once; that way you are not required to enter your contact information each time you wish to download a product or document from our website. Additionally, you may configure your browser to reject cookies sent by Mobile Complete; your ability to view and browse our website will not be impaired in any manner even if you were to block cookies sent by Mobile Complete.
