Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy  
Keynote DeviceAnywhere™ Inc. respects the privacy of all of its users and is committed to protecting such privacy in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy explains our treatment of your Personal Information collected in connection with your activities either on or related to this website referencing this Privacy Policy or related to use of Keynote DeviceAnywhere products and services. This Privacy Policy also explains how you can ask questions and make suggestions about our privacy practices and review and update your personal information.

We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully and to check back periodically as this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies or websites which are not owned or controlled by Keynote DeviceAnywhere Inc. 

Notification of Changes   
We are continually improving and adding new functionality and features to this website and improving and adding to our existing products, services, and programs. Because of these ongoing changes, changes in the law, and the changing nature of technology, our data practices will change from time to time. If and when such data practices change, we will post the changes on this website to notify you of the changes. We encourage you to check this page frequently. This Privacy Policy was last updated on September 21, 2009.  
Information Collected  
In the course of operating this website or offering Keynote DeviceAnywhere products and services, Keynote DeviceAnywhere may collect two types of information about its users: Personal Information and Anonymous Information. 

“Personal Information” is personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, title, phone number, and company name. Personal Information is collected by us only when you choose to provide it to us, such as when you use this website to sign up for the Keynote DeviceAnywhere Test Center Developer service, or use this website to contact Keynote DeviceAnywhere with questions and comments. If you choose to contact any of our customer service representatives, we may keep a record of that correspondence to fully address the subject matter. In addition, we may collect information based on your use of Keynote DeviceAnywhere products and services that allow us to accurately track usage and bill for such services provided.

In addition to the information you provide when you use our website or through use of our products or services, we use technology to collect “Anonymous Information” about the use of our website. For example, we use technology to track how many visitors access our website, the date and time of their visit, the length of their stay, and which pages they view. We also use technology to determine which web browsers our visitors use and the address from which they accessed our website.

This technology does not identify you personally. It simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our website. Keynote DeviceAnywhere uses this anonymous data and shares it with third parties to improve the content and functionality of our website, to better understand our customers and markets, and to improve our products and services.

Cookies  
A “cookie” is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser when you access a website. This data is stored on your computer’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Cookies cannot be used to discover the identity of a user.

Use of Personal Information

Disclosure of Personal Information

Keynote DeviceAnywhere may also disclose the packages of the Service that you are using and your total usage in hours of these packages to partners who are sponsoring the package(s) in question (e.g. to AT&T we may disclose information around your usage of devices in the AT&T package), for purposes of understanding developer usage trends and continuing to improve the service. Keynote DeviceAnywhere will not share, sell or rent this information to any other parties without your prior permission.

Security of Personal Information  
The security of Personal Information is important to us. Keynote DeviceAnywhere takes technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect Personal Information that you provide to us, as well as business related information that you enter when using our products and services. We instruct our employees with access to your Personal Information that it is to be used only in adherence with the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy.

We also protect your Personal Information during transmission by using industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology that includes both server authentication as well as data encryption.
