<p>Revision date:
June 5, 2008</p>

<p>deviantART respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to our web sites,
including <a href="http://www.deviantart.com">www.deviantart.com</a> and
<a href="http://shop.deviantart.com">shop.deviantart.com</a>
(collectively, the “deviantART Sites” or “Sites”). This
Privacy Policy explains what information we collect through the
Sites, how we use that information, and what choices you have. 
</p>

<p>The deviantART
Sites contain links to other web sites. This Privacy Policy does not
apply to the practices of any companies or individuals that
deviantART does not control, or any web sites that you link to from
the deviantART Sites. You should use caution and review the privacy
policies of any sites that you visit from ours to learn more about
their information practices. 
</p>

<p>Please take a few
moments to read this agreement. By accessing the deviantART Sites,
you agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy
and are aware that our policies may evolve in the future as indicated
below.</p>

<h2>What we collect</h2>

<p>In various places
on the deviantART Sites, we collect “Personally Identifiable
Information,” such as your name, age, gender, postal address,
telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information, or other
information that can be used to contact you or identify you as an
individual. For example, we collect this information when you
register for membership and special services (e.g., the Print
Program), sign up for e-mail newsletters and purchase products or
services. From time to time in the future we may offer additional
features, services, and promotional opportunities that would require
you to submit Personally Identifiable Information to participate. 
</p>

<p>We also collect
“Anonymous Information” such as your IP address, the type of
browser you use, the pages on our Sites that you have visited, and
the advertisements that you have clicked on. Your Personally
Identifiable Information is linked to your Anonymous Information.</p>

<p>Like many
Internet sites, we also use “cookies” to collect information. A
cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer and is
stored on your hard drive. When you visit our Site(s) the cookie
identifies your computer to us so that you do not have to re-register
each time you visit. We may also use cookies to measure the traffic
to our Sites and the use of different services and features of the
Sites. Advertisers that appear on the deviantART Sites may place
cookies on your computer and their use of the information stored on
those cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. You should
visit their sites to learn about their information practices.
Advertisers or other companies do not have access to deviantART’s
cookies.
</p>

<p>We do not intend
that children will use our sites. We do not solicit or knowingly
collect information from children under 13 years old, nor will we
accept registration from them. 
</p>

<h2>How we use the information we collect</h2>

<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to 
communicate with you, to process orders for products and services, 
to customize advertising and content available on the deviantART Sites,
to conduct research for internal purposes and to use such information to
improve our services and the deviantART Sites. If you have uploaded Artist
Materials pursuant to the
<a href="http://about.deviantart.com/policy/submission/">Submissions Agreement</a>,
you have also authorized deviantART to use your name and biographical
materials publicly for advertising and promotional purposes.</p>

<p>If you so choose,
we will also use it to send you information about products and
services that may be of interest to you. Later on in this Privacy
Policy, we provide you with more information on what choices you
have.</p>

<p>We use
information that is not personally identifiable to determine how
people use our web site and its services. For example this data
tells us information including how often users click on our
advertisements, which files are downloaded most frequently, and which
areas of our site are the most popular. Analyzing this data allows
us to improve the offerings on and performance of our site(s). Using
your IP address, we can also determine the general physical location
of a user and may at times use this information to better target
advertising to users.</p>

<p>
We have contracted with Lotame Solutions LLC ("Lotame") to better help us
operate the website, report website traffic, statistics, advertisement
'click-throughs', and/or other activities on our web sitewebsite. Lotame
may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to
compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors. Lotame does not
collect personally identifiable information. For more information about how
the information is collected and used by Lotame, please see Lotame's privacy
policy at <a href="http://www.lotame.com/policy.php">http://www.lotame.com/policy.php</a>.</p>

<h2>How we share information</h2>

<p>Except as noted below, deviantART does not share your Personally
Identifiable Information with third parties unless you give us your
permission or we need to share such information in order to provide
products or services you have requested. For example, we use third
parties to help with some of the products and services available on our
site, such as processing payments and fulfilling orders for products
through the deviantART Shop. We also engage third parties to assist
us by tracking the number of visitors to the Sites that have
"clicked-through" from specified promotions on third party
sites and those visitors' activities on the deviantART Site. When we
supply personally identifiable information to these third parties, we
require them to use it only for the function they are helping us
with.
</p>

<p>When you see
parts of our site with a prominent brand of another company,
information you supply (or authorize for use) in that part of the
site will be shared with the other company that is cooperating in
providing the service. Please visit that company’s site to learn
more about their information practices.</p>

<p>We aggregate the
Anonymous Information that we collect and exchange it with
advertisers and others who are interested in our services.
</p>

<p>We will disclose
Personally Identifiable Information when required by law or under the
good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to
conform to applicable law, comply with subpoenas, court orders or
legal process served on deviantART, to establish or exercise our
legal rights or defend against legal claims, and to protect the
property or interests of deviantART, its agents and employees,
personal safety, or the public. Under such circumstances, deviantART
may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from
providing notice of the disclosure, and deviantART reserves the right
to not provide such notice in its sole discretion. If we become part
of another organization, including without limitation, by merger,
change of control, sale of assets, or other acquisition, the
acquiring organization will obtain and have access to the Personally
Identifiable Information collected by deviantART and it will assume
the rights and obligations regarding your Personally Identifiable
Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we cease
operation, your information may be transferred to and used by another
company that offers similar or related products or services. While
we cannot predict a great deal about such an unlikely event, we would
hope this could provide you continuity of service.</p>

<h2>What choices you have</h2>

<p>When you register
for membership at the deviantART Site, you have the option of
checking a box to tell us that you do not want us to send you our
email newsletter. You may also opt out of an automatic logging
process that associates your Personally Identifiable Information with
your recent page views. We will keep track of your decisions in our
database. 
</p>

<p>Even if you
choose not to receive information from us, we reserve the right to
communicate with you on matters we consider especially important.</p>

<h2>Making changes</h2>

<p>You may review
the Personally Identifiable Information we have on file by logging in
and clicking the <a href="http://my.deviantart.com/settings/">Settings &amp; Profile</a>
tab on your user page. Once there, there you may modify information
that is incorrect and delete certain information from your profile. You
can also change your permission for us to send you e-mail
newsletters.</p>

<p>To delete your
Personally Identifiable Information, you must manually change your
data fields to null values. Otherwise, your data is retained
indefinitely. Please note that the public comments made by a user in
a chat room or a forum cannot be deleted. Data related to
transactions for products and services through the deviantART Shop is
retained indefinitely. Moreover, since, Anonymous Information is not
identifiable as originating with you, it cannot be reviewed or
changed by you.</p>

<p>We may change
this policy from time to time. While we will usually indicate major
changes by notice on our site, please check here from time to time to
see if there is a revised policy posted.</p>

<h2>Publicly posted information</h2>

<p>If you register
as a member of the deviantART Sites and make postings to chat rooms,
forums or your user page, please remember that anything you post is
publicly available. The user name you have chosen during the
registration process is visible to all users of the Site. If you
visit another member’s user page, your user name will appear on
that page. Your user page will also show certain statistics
regarding your use of the Site, such as the date you became a member,
how long ago you last visited the Site, the categories of materials
you have posted. Your user profile, and the information you choose
to include in your profile, will also be available to other users of
our chat rooms, forums and to visitors that access your personal user
page. deviantART does not control, and is not responsible for, the
use of any information or content that you have exposed to the public
through your use of the deviantART Sites.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>During sessions
in which you give us information such as credit card numbers, we
encrypt your transmissions using SSL (“Secure Sockets Layer”)
technology. We keep the Personally Identifiable Information you
provide on servers that are protected by firewalls and other
technological means against intrusion or unauthorized access. They
are located in a physically secure facility, and only our employees
and agents with a need to know the information are given access.
While no amount of security can give a perfect guarantee, you can
have a high degree of confidence that the personally identifiable
information you give us is protected from unauthorized access and
use. We rely on you to select passwords that cannot be guessed
easily and to safeguard those passwords from disclosure. Please
contact us if you have any information regarding unauthorized use of
the deviantART sites.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<p>We may update
this Privacy Policy from time to time as our services change and
expand. If we update this Privacy Policy, we will notify you about
significant changes by sending a notice to the email address
specified in your account or by posting a notice of such changes on
the deviantART Sites. Unless otherwise provided, the revised terms
will take effect on the date they are posted. Once such changes
become effective, your continued use of the Site will signify your
acceptance of the new Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the
terms of this Privacy Policy, or any revised Privacy Policy, your
sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Site.</p>
