# DevDaily.com Privacy Policy

* * *

Our privacy policy is very simple -- the only information we collect about site visitors is the basic information available through [Apache](http://apache.org/) log files, and the only way we use this information is to look at the information on an aggregate level. We only look at individual log records when we think there might be a problem with the aggregate data.

We do use several different advertisers on this web site, but we have no control over any information they may attempt to obtain. Please visit their websites for further information about their privacy policies:

  * [google.com/adsense](http://google.com/adsense/)
  * [fastclick](http://fastclick.com/)
  * [burstmedia.com](http://burstmedia.com/)



If our policy ever changes we'll post the change here.
