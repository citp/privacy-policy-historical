		<h2>DevHood Privacy Policy </h2>Your use of the DevHood Web site constitutes 
		your agreement to this privacy policy and consent to the terms herein. Please 
		see the section labeled "Information We Collect and How We Use It" to learn more 
		about our collection and use of user information. 
		<h3>Introduction </h3>DevHood is committed to safeguarding the privacy of 
		visitors to our Web site and users of the other services available through our 
		site (the "Service(s)"). We will use our best efforts to ensure that the 
		information you provide us remains private and is used only for the purposes set 
		forth herein. 
		<p>This privacy policy details our commitment to protect your information and 
		the limited manner in which we will use that information to provide and improve 
		our provision of the Services. 
		</p><h3>Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy </h3>Throughout this 
		privacy policy we use several specialized terms. "Personally Identifiable 
		Information" is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your 
		name, street address, email address, billing address, credit card number and 
		expiration date. "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable 
		Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy policy, 
		including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer. We use the 
		term "aggregate" when we combine information from various persons or users. 
		Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not identify individual 
		persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such 
		information. 
		<h3>Information We Collect and How We Use It </h3>If you visit our site to 
		browse. We will only collect and store the domain name and host from which a 
		user accessed the Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of the user's 
		computer, the user's browser software and operating system, the date and time 
		the user accesses the site and the Internet address of any Web site from which 
		the user linked directly to our site or to which the user links after visiting 
		our site. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to sections 
		of our sites, to determine from where our visitors linked and to where our 
		visitors link from the sites and to help us make our sites more useful. For 
		example, we organize and analyze IP addresses so that we can provide efficient 
		service, enhance security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume 
		statistics. This type of information is sometimes shared with third parties, 
		such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing 
		and commercial purposes. When we share such information with third parties we 
		will require them to abide by the standards of this privacy policy. 
		<p>If you register or engage in a transaction while at our site. To make full 
		use of our Services you will need to complete our registration process. We 
		collect and store the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through 
		this registration process, including your user ID and password, which we may 
		elect to provide for you. If you engage in a transaction while logged on to our 
		site, then we collect and store information about the transaction. If you send 
		us communications, then we may collect such communications in a file specific to 
		you. 
		</p><p>We use the information we collect from you as a registered user to build 
		features that we hope will make the Services more attractive and easier for you 
		to use. This may include better customer support and timely notice of new 
		services. We may share User Information with our partners, affiliates and joint 
		venturers that are committed to serving your need for the Services and improving 
		your user experience, but will require such third parties to abide by the 
		standards of this privacy policy. We may also share aggregate anonymized data 
		relating to activity on the site and use of the Services, such as demographical 
		and statistical information, for marketing, research and other purposes. 
		Furthermore, we may need to disclose User Information to law enforcement or 
		other government officials if appropriate for your protection or in connection 
		with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement or other 
		activity that is illegal or may expose us or our users to legal liability. 
		</p><h3>If You Do Not Wish to Disclose User Information </h3>If you do not want to
