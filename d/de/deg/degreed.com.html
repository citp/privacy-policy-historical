    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>Degreed, Inc. (together with Degreed.com, "Degreed") is committed to respecting the privacy of the users. We strive to provide a safe, secure online user experience.

We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from Degreed. Users participate in Degreed voluntarily.</p>
    <h4>What Information is Collected</h4>

The User maintains full rights and ownership of personal data.</p>
    <h4>How Information is Collected</h4>
    <p>All personal information is gathered directly from Users through online registration forms. Only the User can modify his or her own, personal Degreed Profile once it has been created.</p>

You may remove your Degreed Profile from our database at any time.</p>
    <h4>Scholarships and Scholarship Selection Process</h4>
    <p>Degreed.com is a scholarship provider for students seeking higher education. The scholarship selection process takes into consideration academic achievement. Selection committee uses the student profile, which provides a comprehensive format for applicants to indicate academic merit, to judge scholarship applicants. All further activity on the Degreed site is optional. Students may use the Degreed service simply to apply for Degreed scholarships, or to seek out further education opportunity, all free-of-charge. Scholarship selection panel consists of members educated in education technology and instructional design.</p>
    <h4>Use of Information Obtained by Degreed</h4>

    <p>We do not disclose Users' personal information, combined personal and demographic information or information about use of Degreed.com to Third Parties, except as set forth below:</p>
    <p>We disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property of our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.</p>
    <h4>Correction of Information/Accessibility of Information</h4>
    <p>
        We provide Users with 24 hour access to their personal information after it has been collected. Users may also wish to amend or correct inaccuracies on information provided. If a User wishes to correct such inaccuracies or make any other changes, information can be accessed through our password protected access facility at http://www.degreed.com. If a User wishes to have his or her Degreed Profile deleted from our server, he or she should contact info@degreed.com. Removal from the Degreed server does not guarantee that your Degreed Profile will be removed from third party records. Any information gathered is to the best of our knowledge collected lawfully and fairly through Degreed.com and all information is assumed accurate and up to date and only information which is adequate and not excessive to our purpose for collection is retained.

    </p>
    <h4>Children Under 14 Years of Age</h4>
    <p>
        Degreed does not intend to collect information from children under the age of 14 or knowingly allow those individuals to create profiles. All profiles stored are for college students ages 14 or older and those seeking higher education who state their age to be 14 years or older.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aggregate information about our users routinely gathered about the use of Degreed.com include information such as what pages are being visited most, what domains our visitors are coming from (i.e. google.com), when our servers are busiest, and what websites are referring Users to us. This information helps us to improve our services and to evaluate our marketing efforts. We only use such data anonymously and aggregately. This information may be shared with third parties, but only in the aggregate.
    </p>
    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p>
        We use cookie technology within Degreed.com. We use cookies for remembering User names and passwords and for tracking click streams. Also, third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a User's prior visits to Degreed.com. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to Degreed.com and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">Ads Settings</a>. We do not utilize cookies to track Users activities in any other way. Cookies cannot obtain personally identifiable information such as e-mail addresses, or any other information stored on our Users hard drives. Cookies are pieces of data normally stored by your browser, and you can quite easily prevent cookie data from being sent by adjusting your browser settings; however Degreed.com will not function properly if Cookies are not enabled. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Degreed pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience.
    </p>
    <h4>Information Protection and Security</h4>
    <p>When a User submits information to Degreed, whether it is name or email, we do our utmost to ensure that information is protected against loss, misuse, alteration, destruction or unauthorized access. Degreed uses standard encryption tools such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to help protect personal information and to keep information collected secure. Encryption can be used after your data has left your internal system. Encryption renders your data unreadable using a mathematical formula known as the key. Your data is turned back into readable form, i.e. deciphered, by applying the correct key. Due to the nature of this technology, there is always a remote danger of information interception no matter what barriers are in place. Our system does provide for profiles to be sent via un-encrypted email, and may be susceptible to intercept at this point. Employees within Degreed with access to User information provided are instructed to utilize such information only in adherence to this Privacy Policy. Employees who utilize information for any reason other than the reasons stated within this Privacy Policy may be subject to reprimand or even legal proceedings. The privacy policies of linked sites may differ from those of Degreed.</p>
    <h4>Contact Details</h4>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or any questions, complaints or claims, please contact us at:</p>
