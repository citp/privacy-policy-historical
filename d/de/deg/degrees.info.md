# Degrees.info - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

Effective April 4, 2005

Degrees.info is owned and operated by Adchemy, Inc.

Adchemy knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. To make this Privacy Policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. By visiting Adchemy's primary Web site or related Web sites that Adchemy controls or operates (collectively “Adchemy Sites”), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.

**What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?  
**This Privacy Policy covers Adchemy’s treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Adchemy gathers when you are accessing Adchemy Sites and when you use Adchemy services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers Adchemy’s treatment of any Personal Information that Adchemy’s business partners share with Adchemy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use of your Personal Information by third parties to which such information is provided by Adchemy that Adchemy does not own or control, or to individuals that Adchemy does not employ or manage.

**What Personal Information Does Adchemy Collect And Maintain?  
**We collect the following types of information from our customers:

**Personal Information You Provide to Us:  
**We receive and store any information you enter on Adchemy Sites or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include name, address, phone number, and email address. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new products. 

**Personal Information Collected Automatically:**

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with Adchemy Sites or services. Adchemy automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.
  * Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to Adchemy Sites and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Adchemy uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Adchemy Sites or services so that we can make the Adchemy Sites appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers use Adchemy Sites. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and Adchemy Sites, so that they, too, may seek to provide you with an optimal online experience.
  * Many companies offer programs that help you to visit Web sites anonymously. While Adchemy will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.  




**What About Cookies?**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in Adchemy Sites are visited and by how many people. Adchemy and its affiliated third parties may use cookies that collect Personal Information, and we may combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
  * Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Adchemy Sites’ most attractive features.
  * We use third-party advertising technology to serve ads when you visit our Web site and sites upon which we advertise. This technology uses information about your visits to this Web site and the sites upon which we advertise, (not including your name, address, or other personal information), to serve our ads to you. In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our ad serving partner, to help manage our online advertising. These web beacons enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Web site. The information we collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable. To learn more about our third party ad serving partner, cookies, and how to “opt-out,” please visit http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy.
