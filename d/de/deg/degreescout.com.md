## Information We Collect:

There are several areas on our website where you may be asked to enter both personal and non-personal information. Our website uses these input forms for clients and potential clients to request information about our products and services. We may also collect information in order to notify you about products, services, and other opportunities we think will be of interest to you.

No personally identifiable information is tied to a clear gif. Clear gifs are also used in connection with our HTML-based emails to allow us to know when an email has been opened. If you do not wish to receive such email communications, please refer to the Opt Out policy below.

Although DegreeScout uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet.

## Links to Other Sites:

Please note that this website contains links and banner advertising that may direct you to other websites. In addition, you may have arrived at this website via a link or banner ad on a third party website. This Privacy Policy applies to all information that you provide to DegreeScout only.

Providing your email address to either DegreeScout and/or any of its Clients represents your affirmative consent to receive such communications. Additionally, you may also receive emails that advertise DegreeScout services from third party publishers. We have strict policies for dealing with any third party email services to ensure that advertisements for DegreeScout are not sent out through a “Spam” mailing and to ensure that our offers are sent only to those individuals who have given us their email addresses.

## Opt Out:

DegreeScout uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals. We may maintain separate email lists for different purposes.

Our unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by DegreeScout on its own behalf. You may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and your personal information may still be shared with Third Parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends.

You should also note that unsubscribing from our electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber s information from any Third Party associates and licensees of the data. Since Third Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate databases from us, and you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.

You may continue to receive email communications from us up to ten business days from the time we receive your unsubscribe request. Please note that DegreeScout can only control its own mailing list and policies. Third party advertisers that maintain their own mailing lists may send communications that advertise our services, and you may need to contact these parties directly in order to stop receiving their email communications. If you do not opt out, your Personal Information may be used as described in this Privacy Policy.
