Degrees For RNs has established the following Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. This policy describes the overall privacy practices of Degrees For RNs regarding information we collect on our network of web sites and through our other Internet advertising mediums, including but not limited to email, newsletters, and leave-behinds. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Degrees For RNs does not own or control, or to people that Degrees For RNs does not employ.</p>

<h3 class="normal_bold">Information Collected by Degrees For RNs</h3>
<p class="simple_text"><i><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</strong></i></p>

<p class="simple_text">Degrees For RNs collects various types of information from you to better meet your needs and to provide you with a more relevant user experience. Some of this information is collected automatically through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer) or other Internet tracking technologies. The type of information your browser or Internet session may automatically provide us with can include the browser you are using, your Internet domain, the operating system on your computer, your IP address and the URL you saw just before coming to the Degrees For RNs site, the pages of the site you visited and the URL of the page you visited upon leaving the site. Degrees For RNs may also contract with reputable third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may also use cookies or other measures to collect your non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3 class="normal_bold">Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</h3>

<p class="simple_text">In addition, at some of the Degrees For RNs web sites, we collect information that you may choose to provide to us when requesting additional information from us or from one or more of our clients. Examples of personally identifiable data that you may provide to us include name, address, and email address. If you provide personally identifiable data to us, you may later elect to have your information deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the opt-out procedures set forth below.</p>
<h3 class="normal_bold">How Collected Information is Used</h3>

<p class="simple_text">The non-personally identifiable information that Degrees For RNs collects is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience. The information is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals. If you elect to provide Degrees For RNs with personally identifiable information, we may utilize such information for marketing purposes, and this use may result in follow-up communications from Degrees For RNs and from our clients. In addition, that information may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to your preferences and behaviors, and for other Degrees For RNs sales and marketing efforts.</p>
<h3 class="normal_bold">Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>

<p class="simple_text">All personally identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence by Degrees For RNs. There are instances, however, in which your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below. Your non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of Degrees For RNs on an anonymous basis. When you request information from Degrees For RNs or one or more of our clients, we may transfer that information within Degrees For RNs or route your information to our client(s), across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world, so that they may provide the information on their product or service that you requested. We may also disclose information to a third party who provides substantially similar services as the original service about which you requested more information. In such situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that Degrees For RNs is very careful in selecting companies with whom it does business. In addition to the above situations where your information may be shared with others, there is also the possibility that Degrees For RNs, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. In the event of such transaction, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to all collected personally identifiable information. Finally, Degrees For RNs may share your information as necessary to comply with a court order or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.</p>
