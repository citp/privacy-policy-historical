## What Information is Collected

Information collected may include, among other things, personal information such as a participating User's name and includes other identifying information about that person such as an email address, details of academic history and other information entered into the User profile ("Degreed Profile"). All information entered is voluntary. Examples of areas on Degreed where we collect data are pages where Users can open a Degreed account, create a Degreed Profile or enter information required for scholarship consideration. If a User does provide such information, he or she is thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. The User maintains full rights and ownership of his or her individual personal data and to the extent the User wishes to retain an independent record of such User's Degreed Profile, the User must include a personal email at the time of creating his/her Degreed Profile.

## How Information is Collected

All User Materials are gathered directly from Users through online registration forms. Only the User can modify his or her own, personal Degreed Profile once it has been created. You may remove your Degreed Profile from our database at any time.

Personal User Information May Be Utilized For the Following Purposes:

  * To provide information or services that a User has requested; To service a User's account;
  * To improve Degreed's services;
  * To develop and/or inform Users of additional products or services we think will be of interest and benefit to Users, including allowing Users to share their information with specific universities that the Users are interested in receiving addition information about;
  * To answer questions Users may have; and
  * To inform winners of scholarships which we run regularly.



## Scholarships and Scholarship Selection Process

Degreed is a scholarship provider for Users seeking higher education. The scholarship selection process takes into consideration academic achievement. The selection committee uses the applicant's User Profile, which provides a comprehensive format for Users to indicate and assess academic merit. All further activity on the Degreed Site is optional. Users may use the Degreed service simply to apply for Degreed scholarships or to seek out further education opportunities, all free-of-charge. The scholarship selection panel consists of members in the education technology and instructional design fields.

## Non-Personally Identifiable Anonymous Information

Where possible, the Degreed servers automatically recognize each User's Internet Protocol address. Also, aggregate information about Degreed Users is routinely gathered for purposes of identifying the use of Degreed.com, including information such as what pages are being visited most, what domains our visitors are coming from (i.e. google.com), when our servers are busiest, and what websites are referring Users to us and aggregated data for purposes of analysis, gathering employment statistical information and for learning and training. This information helps us to improve our services and to evaluate our marketing efforts. We only use such data anonymously and aggregately. This information may be shared with third parties, but only in the aggregate. The treatment of non-personally identifiable information is subject to change in accordance with the then applicable law. Degreed owns all rights in and to this anonymous and aggregated data.

## Use of Information Obtained by Degreed

When a User registers with Degreed, he or she creates a unique Degreed Profile and establishes individualized privacy settings. Each User is able to edit and update the information provided in his or her Degreed Profile. We may, on occasion, email our Users to send notifications about new features on the site. Each User shall be allowed opt-in to such emails.

Degreed will not use User personal Degreed Profile information except as described above, or as otherwise provided by law. We disclose information if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property of our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.

Any information gathered is to the best of our knowledge collected lawfully and fairly through Degreed.com and all information is assumed accurate and up to date and only information which is adequate and not excessive to our purpose for collection is retained. Users may review, correct, update or change their Degreed Profile and the information therein at any time. From each Degreed account, Users may also opt out of receiving newsletters and certain other correspondence from Degreed. If a User wishes to delete his or her Degreed Profile, that User can do so in the Personal section of their Profile Settings. Once the User has arrived to the Profile Settings page the User can select "Delete Profile" and select "yes" to confirm that the User would like to delete his or her account.

##  Cookies on other websites 

Users may be directed to other websites through links within Degreed. Degreed has no control over the practices of other websites not owned or controlled by Degreed. Your computer may receive cookies from other websites and such websites are not subject to Degreed's Privacy Policy. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a User's prior visits to Degreed.com. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to Degreed.com and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting [Google Ads Settings](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en). 

Other sites may place a cookie on your computer for the purposes of ad tracking and presentation. Degreed is in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act, and we are exempt from the requirements of California's "Shine the Light" law because Degreed does not share personally identifiable visitor information with its advertising services for direct marketing purposes. 

We do not control third-parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/), a coalition of online advertising networks that provides an opportunity for consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising by member companies. It should be noted that opting out does not mean you will not see advertisements online, but these advertisements will not be targeted based on your online user interest profile.

Any User's use of a Site or the submission of any personally identifiable information to Degreed will constitute User's consent to the transfer of such User's personally identifiable information outside of such User's home country, including the United States, which may have very different data protection and privacy rules and regulations than in such User's home country.
