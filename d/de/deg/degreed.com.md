Most personal information you provide to us is voluntary, unless indicated otherwise. Examples of areas on the Site where we collect data are pages where you can open a Degreed account and create a Degreed Profile. Only you can modify your own personal Degreed Profile once it has been created. You may remove your Degreed Profile from our database at any time. To the extent you wish to retain an independent record of such your Degreed Profile, you must include a personal email address at the time of creating your Degreed Profile.

We may combine the information we collect with publicly available information and information we receive from our parent, affiliate, or subsidiary companies, business partners, and other third parties. We may use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you about products, services, and events that may be of interest to you, for promotional purposes, and for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

In addition, if you access and use the Site or the Services on a mobile device and your mobile device's settings allow it, we may collect information about your real-time location.

For example, you can disable "Location" (or "Location Services" on iOS-based devices) on your mobile device to prevent sharing your location information with us. Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your mobile device to learn how to adjust your mobile device settings. Please note that if you disable the sharing of location information, you may be unable to access some features of our Services that are designed for mobile devices.

We may enable you to log into the Services using a social media account, and if you do so you may be asked to grant us access to certain information from your social media profile, such as your public profile, birthday, current city, and e-mail address. Social media networks operate independently from Degreed, and we are not responsible for social media networks' interfaces or privacy or security practices.

### Non-Personally Identifiable Anonymous Information

This information helps us to improve our services and to evaluate our marketing efforts. We only use such data anonymously and aggregately.
