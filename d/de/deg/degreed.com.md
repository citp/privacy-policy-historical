Aggregate information about our users routinely gathered about the use of Degreed.com include information such as what pages are being visited most, what domains our visitors are coming from (i.e. google.com), when our servers are busiest, and what websites are referring Users to us. This information helps us to improve our services and to evaluate our marketing efforts. We only use such data anonymously and aggregately.

#### Cookies

We use cookie technology within Degreed.com. We use cookies for remembering User names and passwords and for tracking click streams. We do not utilize cookies to track Users activities in any other way. Cookies cannot obtain personally identifiable information such as e-mail addresses, or any other information stored on our Users hard drives. Cookies are pieces of data normally stored by your browser, and you can quite easily prevent cookie data from being sent by adjusting your browser settings; however Degreed.com will not function properly if Cookies are not enabled. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Degreed pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. 

#### Information Protection and Security

When a User submits information to Degreed, whether it is name or email, we do our utmost to ensure that information is protected against loss, misuse, alteration, destruction or unauthorized access. Degreed uses standard encryption tools such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to help protect personal information and to keep information collected secure. Encryption can be used after your data has left your internal system. Encryption renders your data unreadable using a mathematical formula known as the key. Your data is turned back into readable form, i.e. deciphered, by applying the correct key. Due to the nature of this technology, there is always a remote danger of information interception no matter what barriers are in place. Our system does provide for profiles to be sent via un-encrypted email, and may be susceptible to intercept at this point. Employees within Degreed with access to User information provided are instructed to utilize such information only in adherence to this Privacy Policy. Employees who utilize information for any reason other than the reasons stated within this Privacy Policy may be subject to reprimand or even legal proceedings. The privacy policies of linked sites may differ from those of Degreed.
