		<h2>Information We Collect Automatically</h2>
		<p>We collect various types of information from our visitors so we can adjust our site to meet our users' needs and expectations. Some of this information is collected automatically through cookies and other information is collected when you register for any of our online services or when you request information from one of our partners.</p>
    <p>The types of information your browser or Internet session automatically sends us each time you visit one of our sites, which we automatically collect, includes: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your browser, e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator.</li>
			<li>Your Internet domain, e.g., AOL, Netcom, Earthlink, etc.</li>
			<li>Your computer's operating system, e.g., Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, Linux.</li>
			<li>Your navigation path, i.e., the URLs of where you come to our site from, which of our pages you visit, and where you go as you leave.</li>
			<li>Your IP address. This information lets us see how users are finding our sites, and it tells us which pages are visited the most often so we can make our Websites more useful.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Use of “Cookies”</h2>
		<p>When you visit some of our sites, we use cookies to keep track of your information. This small piece of program code resides on your computer and stores your contact information for all of our request information sites. We do this so you are not required to re-enter your contact information.</p>
    <p>Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by DegreeSearch.org only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

		<h2>Web Beacons </h2>
		<p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>

		<h2>Information You Provide to Us</h2>
		<p>In addition to the information automatically collected by your browser, we also collect information that you provide to us when you request information about a particular school or educational program.</p>
    <p>Our websites provide users the opportunity to request information from schools, and to learn about various education opportunities. These information request sites require users to provide us with contact information (name, address, phone number, email address, age, work experience, etc.) as well as information about their interest in one of our marketing partners (universities, colleges, test prep companies, financial aid providers, etc.). We collect this information that you provide, and may use it to make your future requests from our websites easier by pre-populating contact forms with the information that you have provided. We provide this contact information that you provide to the marketing partner that you requested information from. Customer interest information is collected to determine what information the customer wishes to be sent.</p>
		<h2>How We Use This Information</h2>

If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>
    <h3>Legal Disclaimer:</h3>
