			<h2>Definitions</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Cookies</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Data created by a Web server that is stored on a user's computer. It provides a way for the Website to keep track of a user's patterns and preferences and, with the cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user's own hard disk.</p>
					<p>The cookies contain a range of URLs (Web addresses) for which they are valid. When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to the Web server. For example, if a user's ID were stored as a cookie, it would save that person from typing in the same information all over again when accessing that service for the second and subsequent time during the same browser session.</p>
					<p>You can opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the Options or Preferences menu.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>IP (Internet Protocol) Address</dt>
				<dd>This is the address of a computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client and server station must have a unique IP address. Client workstations have either a permanent address or one that is dynamically assigned for each session. IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by periods; for example, 204.171.64.2.</dd>
				<dt>Browser Session</dt>
				<dd>A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser is in consecutive use. The session begins when you open the browser and ends when you close it. When you reopen the browser, you begin a new session.</dd>
				<dt>SSL Encryption (Secure Sockets Layer)</dt>
				<dd>The leading security protocol on the Internet. When an SSL session is started, the browser sends its public key to the server so that the server can securely send a secret key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data via secret key encryption during that session.</dd>
				<dt>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</dt>
				<dd>An Internet address. URLs are used to locate sites on the Internet and to navigate between sites and pages within sites. The URL for DegreeSearch.org is www.DegreeSearch.org.</dd>
