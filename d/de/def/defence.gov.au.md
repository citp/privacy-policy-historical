Defence collects personal information both directly from the individual concerned, and from other persons, bodies or entities, including an individual's commander, manager and supervisor, and from specialist service providers, such as medical practitioners.

The purposes for which Defence collects personal information are outlined in Part 4.

You are entitled to request access to personal information Defence holds about you or to request correction of that information. Information about how to do this is provided in Part 7.

Enquires regarding the Defence Privacy Policy or Defence's privacy practices in general should be directed to the Defence Privacy Officer.

Detailed information on the APPs can be found on the website of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.

The Defence Privacy Policy is reviewed annually to ensure the information it contains is accurate, complete, relevant and up-to-date.
