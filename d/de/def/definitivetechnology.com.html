		<h1>PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT</h1>
		
		<p>Definitive Technology its subsidiaries and affiliate companies (“Definitive”) understand 
		that the protection and use of information provided by you to Definitive is important to you. 
		Definitive is committed to maintaining your privacy. This Privacy Policy Statement sets out 
		our information collection, use and dissemination practices for website (the “Website”). By 
		visiting the Definitive Website you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy 
		Statement and hereby grant your consent to collect this information. Please read this Privacy 
		Policy Statement to understand how Definitive collects, uses and disseminates information 
		through our Website. </p>
		
		<h2>What Personal Information About You Does Definitive Collect?</h2>
		<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your 
		shopping experience. Here are the types of information we gather. </p>

		<h2>Information You Give Us:</h2>
		<p>We receive and store any information you enter on this Website or give us in any other way. 
		This information includes demographic information and contact information such as names, 
		addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses. You can choose not to provide 
		certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features 
		or conduct transactions. </p>
		
		<h2>Information Automatically Collected:</h2>
		<p>Definitive may also automatically collect non-personal information and data through the use of 
		Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive 
		through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to enhance your 
		experience using our Website. Through cookies, a website can recognize repeat users, facilitate 
		the user’s access to and use of the Website, and allow a site to track usage behavior. Examples 
		of the information we may collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to 
		connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection 
		information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history, 
		which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers.</p>
		
		<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from 
		accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to 
		disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our 
		Website’s features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. Definitive uses one or more 
		companies to place advertisements for our products and services and those of third parties on 
		our Site and third-party sites. Cookies and other technologies such as Web beacons or tags are 
		used to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to determine the display of content and advertising 
		to you based on your interests both on our site , as well as on third-party sites where you may 
		visit. To support this interest based advertising solution, we, and companies who we have contracted 
		with, may use anonymous information about your visits to our and other Web sites. The information 
		collected and used by this process is always anonymous, and does not enable any third-party to 
		identify you individually.</p>
		
		<h2>How is Collected Information Used?</h2>
		<p>We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, 
		fulfilling your orders, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and 
		communicating with you.</p>
		
		<h2>Does Definitive Share Information?</h2>
		<p>Definitive is not in the business of selling your information to others. We share customer 
		information only as described herein. We have controls that either are subject to this Privacy 
		Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

		<ul class="normal">
			
			<li><strong>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</strong> 
			For certain transactions we work closely with our affiliated businesses to package, ship and fulfill 
			your order. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with 
			these businesses. We may share customer information related to those transactions with third parties.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals 
			to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending 
			postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, 
			providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and 
			links), measuring the effectiveness of our ads, determining the display of content, processing credit 
			card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to 
			perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes not described herein.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Promotional Offers:</strong> Sometimes we send offers 
			to selected groups of customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that 
			business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers you can let us know by sending 
			an email to info@DefinitiveTech.com.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop 
			our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer 
			information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises 
			made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy Statement (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). 
			Also, in the unlikely event that Definitive, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer 
			information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Protection of Definitive and Others:</strong> We release 
			account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; 
			enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of 
			Definitive, our shareholders, users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies 
			and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not 
			include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from 
			customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How Do I Grant Consent?</h2>
		<p>You hereby grant consent for Definitive to collect the information as set out in this Privacy Policy Statement. 
		Other than as set out above, you will not receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, 
		and you will not have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. You may withdraw or limit you 
		consent by contacting Definitive at info@DefinitiveTech.com. Although it is our hope that you find the 
		display of advertising to you based on your anonymous interests valuable, if you would prefer not to 
		participate in the services offered through these solutions, you can always opt-out of this activity by 
		visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website</a>.</p>

		<h2>What About Children?</h2>
		<p>It is Definitive’s intention that our Website be use only by adults. Definitive does not sell products 
		for purchase by children. If you are under 18, you may use the Website only with the involvement of a parent 
		or guardian. Definitive does not knowingly send direct mailings to anyone under the age of 16. </p>

		<h2>What About Other Policies and Revisions?</h2>
		<p>If you choose to visit our Website, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and 
		our Terms of Use which are incorporated herein by reference, including limitations on damages, arbitration 
		of disputes, and application of the law of the state of California. We encourage you to familiarize 
		yourself with this policy.  </p>
