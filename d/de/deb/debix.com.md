# Privacy Policy – AllClear ID

_Last Updated: January 2016_

Thank you for accessing the AllClear ID Website (the “Site”). By visiting the Site directly or through another site, you accept the practices described in this Policy. To learn more about how we protect your privacy, please read this Privacy Policy.

**This Privacy Policy explains:**

  * **Information Collected:** How we collect, use and (under certain conditions) disclose your personal information
  * **Information Use:** Steps we take to secure your personal information
  * **Information Sharing, Retention & Destruction:** Your options regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information



**Information Collected**

We collect personal information and non-personal information through the Site. “Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual. “Non-personal Information” is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. We may collect the following types of Personal Information:

  * Information provided by you when registering for the services through the Site or on the phone. For example, you may be required to submit Personal Information such as your name, address, Social Security number, date of birth, telephone number and e-mail address to enroll in order to register for identity monitoring.
  * Information provided about your children when enrolling your children in child identity monitoring products. For example, as a legal guardian, you may be required to submit the child”s first and last name, Social Security number, and date of birth in order to register that child in identity monitoring.
  * When you register for a service that requires enrollment and payment through the Site or on the phone, we may collect your credit card number or other payment account number, billing address and other information related to such transaction (collectively, “Payment Information”) from you if your services are being purchased by you and not by a sponsor company on your behalf.



It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information. However, if you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to register for, or use, certain features of the service.

When you visit the Site, we may collect Non-personal Information, such as a catalog of the Site pages you visit. Non-personal information is generally collected through the Site from the following sources: server log files, environmental variables, cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies and information that you voluntarily provide.

  * _Server Log Files._ Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site”s servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.
  * _Environmental Variables._ We may also collect certain environmental variables, such as computer type (ex. Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version. These environmental variables are collected by most browsers, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.
  * _Cookies and Similar Technologies._ We and our service providers may use “cookies” or similar technologies on the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual”s computer for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by many websites, and can facilitate your ongoing access to and use of a particular website; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular website, to your computer. Additionally, please see the “Your Choices” section below for instructions on how to opt-out of sharing certain information related to the use of cookies.
  * _Pixel Tags._ We may also use so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1×1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on the visitors´ hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, to provide online advertising, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.
  * _Information That You Voluntarily Provide._ We also collect non-personal information (e.g., your geographic location, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us. When such information is not combined with any personal information, such information is considered to be non-personal information, as it does not personally identify you or any other user. Additionally, we may aggregate personal information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using personal information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information is considered non-personal information for purposes of this Policy.
