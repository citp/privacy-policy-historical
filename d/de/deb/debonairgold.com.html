        <p>We  have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our dedication to  respecting privacy. This Privacy Policy sets out our practices with  respect to personal information collected regarding visitors and  subscribers (collectively referred as "you") of this Site. This Site is  an adult website and membership is solely restricted to adults; persons  under the age of eighteen are strictly prohibited from this Site and we  do not intentionally collect information on individuals under the age  of eighteen. By visiting or subscribing to this Site, you agree and  consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to  time, as well as the terms and conditions of this Site. </p>
      <strong>What Information   is Collected?</strong>
        <p>We  collect personal information that is voluntarily provided to us via the  registration form for any of our services or memberships. This  information may include, but not be limited to, the subscriber's name,  physical address, email address, birth date, username, password, and on occasion a unique  identifier (such as their mother's maiden name). If a subscriber sends  any personal communication or correspondence, by any means, to the  Site, or any of its employees, agents or representatives, the Site may  collect any information regarding that communication and include that  information in its customer database. </p>
      <strong>Non-Personal Information and Cookies </strong>
        <p>Certain  non-personal information may be collected from visitors to this Site  including, but not limited to, their browser type, operating system, IP  address, and the domain name from which they accessed the Site. Other  non-personal information may be collected such as browsing behavior,  date and time of visit, the pages visited; the time spent viewing the  Site, the number of times the visitor returns to the Site, and  click-stream data. We do not track any information about visitors once  they leave our Site. We may use cookies to collect this information. We  may also allow unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to  serve cookies to visitors of our Site. You are always free to decline  cookies, but in doing so they may not be able to use certain features  on our Site. </p>
      <strong>Use of Information </strong>
        <p>We  collect personal information so that we may custom tailor the web  experience for each subscriber and offer the best products and services  to meet the needs of each subscriber. </p>
      <p>We may use  information collected from visitors to our Site for any of the  following purposes: (1) to send visitors information and promotional  materials about our company, which will not continue if opted out of,  (2) to send visitors information and promotional materials from our  marketing partners and third parties (3) to deliver targeted display  advertisements and offers by email, which will not continue if opted  out of (4) to contact visitors to our Site when necessary, (5) to allow  one-click purchases or access to proprietary content by pre-populating  fields, within registration or other transaction screens, with a  visitor's name, billing address, all as provided by that visitor, (6)  to help diagnose problems with our server, (7) to administer our Site,  (8) to conduct internal reviews of our Site (e.g., to determine the  number of visitors to the Site), (9) to help us better understand  visitors' use of our Site, and (10) to protect the security or  integrity of our Site. </p>
      <p>Since part of the personal  information that is collected and safeguarded by us is your email  address, we try very hard to respect your time and privacy by  controlling and limiting the frequency of mailings. If you receive a  mailing from us or one of our marketing partners, it is because your  email address is either listed with us as someone who has expressly  shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the  future, or you have registered or purchased or otherwise have an  existing relationship with us. </p>
      <p>There may be  occasions when you will be presented with special offers either from us  or from third-party service or content providers, which may include  communications, newsletters, commercial advertising, or other  promotional or special event materials (collectively referred to as  "Offers"). Your consent to this Privacy Policy acts as your consent to  receive these occasional mailings by us and by our third party service  or content providers. </p>
      <p>The Site is not responsible  or liable for the use of any information that a subscriber may provide,  or that is gathered by third-party websites that have ads or links on  the Site. This Site does not control, monitor or endorse the  information gathering practices or Privacy Policies of any of those  third-party websites. Whenever applicable, each subscriber should seek  to read the Privacy Policy of any third-party website provider that has  an advertising banner, advertises or has a link on the Site. </p>
      <p>If you have   received unsolicited email sent via this system or purporting to be sent via   this system, please <a href="contact.php">contact us here</a>. </p>
      <strong>Security </strong>
        <p>This  Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and  alteration of the information under our control. Regarding all credit  card transactions, the credit card information you provide, is  transmitted for processing via SSL encryption technology, which is the  current standard in Internet encryption. As for all other information,  visitors and subscribers should consider this communication and  information to be non-confidential, and consequently, we assume no  responsibility or liability if any information relating to any visitor  or subscriber is intercepted and/or used by an unintended recipient. </p>
      <strong>Acceptance of   these Terms</strong>
        <p>By  visiting or subscribing to this Site, you agree to the practices  described in this Privacy Policy. We may at any time revise or amend  any of these terms and conditions. You are bound by any such revisions  and should therefore periodically visit this page to review the  then-current terms and conditions to which you are bound. To the extent  that any of the third-party sites accessible through our Site (such as  our advertisers) have different privacy practices from those stated in  this Privacy Policy, those third-party privacy practices govern the  collection and use of information you provide when visiting those  sites. We are not responsible for the policies, content, and practices  of other companies which may collect personal information as a  third-party web service provider that has an advertising banner or link  on the Site. </p></td>
