# Privacy Policy - We Will Not Share Your Information

Effective Date: March 19, 2019

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the information ClayRun LLC (“ClayRun,” “we,” or “us”) collects from or about you.  It also describes how we may use, share, and handle the information we collect.

Before using this website (the “Site”), you should review this Policy and the Terms and Conditions on this Site.  By using this Site, you are consenting to the collection, processing, use, and disclosure of your information as set forth in this Policy.  If you do not agree to be bound by this Policy, you are not authorized to, and you may not, access or use this Site.  This Policy is incorporated into our Terms and Conditions that govern your use of this Site.  You may access these Terms and Conditions by using the link provided at the bottom of each page of this Site.

ClayRun LLC reserves the right to revise this Policy at any time, in our discretion, and for any or no reason.  Such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting such changes to this Site.  By continuing to access and use this Site, you acknowledge and agree that you shall be bound by any such revisions.  Accordingly, you should periodically review this Policy.  For your convenience, whenever this Policy is changed, we will update the “Effective Date” at the top of this page.  We encourage you to check the Effective Date to see if this Policy has been revised since your last visit.

## What Information We Collect

When you interact with us through the Site, or otherwise use or visit the Site, we may collect personal information, that is, information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us.  For example, we may collect your name, contact information, date of birth, and debt information.  In certain instances, you may have the choice to provide such information.  However, if you choose not to do so, it may impact our ability to provide you with certain services or assistance.  You may also have the opportunity to opt into receiving communications from us.  Where indicated just select the appropriate option.  We may also collect non-personally identifiable information, including through the use of cookies.

 _Information from your web browser or mobile device._ You may generally visit most of our Site without telling us who you are or providing personal information.  We may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser or mobile device when you visit our Site.  For example, we may collect your IP address, the name and type of your browser, and the date and time you visit our Site, depending on your browser or device settings which you may be able to change.  While this information is not, on its own, personally identifiable, we may combine it with other information that does identify you.

 _Cookies and Other Technologies:_ A “cookie” is a small file placed on your device when you visit a site, such as ours.  A “session cookie” expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser).  A “persistent cookie” stores information on the hard drive so that when you end your session and return to the same web site at a later date, the cookie information is still available.  We use cookies and other technologies to collect information to improve and support functions on this Site so we can serve you better.  For example, we may use these technologies to:

  * collect information about how visitors access and use this Site, such as which pages they visit and for how long, and what functions or links they use most often; and
  * support the features and functionality of this Site and make it more personal, for example, by repopulating information you have already provided so you do not need to enter that information again.



As with your browser, we do not collect personally identifiable information using cookies and other technologies, but we may link it to personal information that you provide or that we have.  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.   However, you may, at any time, control the use of cookies by selecting your browser settings on your device.  You may also be able to receive an alert when a cookie is placed on your device.  If you choose to reject cookies when you access or use this Site, it may impact your ability to use all of the features and functions on this Site.

In addition to the cookies we may deliver to your computer or device through this Site, some of our third party partners may deliver cookies to you.  For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that helps us understand how visitors engage with our Sites.  To learn more about Google Analytics, [**click here**](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html).  Other third parties may deliver cookies to your computer or mobile device in order to track your online behaviors over time and across nonaffiliated websites or to deliver targeted advertisements either on this Site or on other websites.  You have choices about the information third parties may collect about you through this Site.  For example, if you do not want your information sent to a third party, you may download an Opt-out Browser Add-on by [**clicking here**](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

Please be aware that if you do not configure your browser or actively opt out, you will accept cookies provided by this Site.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect from or about you for various purposes, including: to provide you with requested information and services; to contact you as needed for your use of the Site; and to enhance our security and prevent fraud.  We understand that you may wish to make choices about how we collect, use, and share your information.  In certain instances, you may opt-out of how we or third parties collect or handle your personal information.  If you have a question about your ability to opt-out or would like to exercise this right, please contact us as provided below.

 _Do Not Track Mechanisms._ Your browser may deliver a “Do-Not-Track (‘DNT’) signal,” or similar mechanism for exercising choices about the collection of information about your online activities.  Because technology continues to change, we do not guarantee that we will honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms at this time.

You may change previously-expressed preferences for how we use information you provide on or through this Site.  For example, if you have provided your contact information and receive periodic emails from us, you may choose to stop receiving those emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in an email’s footer.  You may be able to change other preferences through an account you create on this Site.  Otherwise, please contact us using the information provided below.

 _Click-Through Agreements._ When you sign up to use special features of this Site, you may be asked to agree to special terms governing your use of the special feature.  In some cases, you may be asked to expressly consent to special terms, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button marked “I agree.”  This type of agreement is known as a “click-through” agreement. If any terms of the click-through agreement differ from the terms of this Policy, the terms of the click-through agreement will supplement or amend this Policy and be binding upon you, but only with respect to the matters specified in the “click-through” agreement.

## Reviewing Your Information

You may contact us for assistance in order to review, update, or correct any personal information provided.  We will respond to you within a reasonable time and provide assistance to the extent possible or as required by law.

## Safeguarding Your Information

We maintain reasonable administrative, physical and technical measures to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information.
