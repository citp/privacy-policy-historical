# Debtsolver Privacy Policy

This website is brought to you by Debt Solver Ltd. We take the privacy of our website users very seriously. We ask that you read this Privacy Policy ('the Policy') carefully as it contains important information about how we will use your personal data.

For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, Debt Solver Ltd ('we' or 'us') is the 'data controller' (i.e. the company who is responsible for, and controls the processing of, your personal data).

**Personal data we may collect about you**

We will obtain personal data about you (such as your name and address) whenever you complete an online enquiry.

We may monitor your usage of this website. This may include monitoring how many times you visit, which pages you go to, traffic data, location data and the originating domain name of a user's internet service provider. This information helps us to build a profile of our users. Some of this data will be aggregated or statistical, which means that we will not be able to identify you individually. Please see further the section on 'Use of cookies' below. Occasionally we may receive information about you from other sources which we will add to the information which we already hold about you in order to help us improve and personalise our service to you.

We may share your personal data with organisations who are our business partners and we or they may contact you, unless you have asked us or them not to do so, by email, telephone, fax or mail about our products, special offers or other information which may be of interest to you from time to time.

We will use technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data, for example:

**Use of cookies**

When you use this website, we may collect information about your computer, such as your IP address and/or browser, which we will use for administration purposes and statistical analysis. This information will not usually identify you personally.

We may also obtain information about your online movements and use of the internet. We do this by placing a 'cookie', which is a small file, on your computer's hard disk. Cookies are used for several reasons:

**Transfers of data out of the EEA**

We may need to transfer your personal data to certain countries which are located outside the European Economic Area. Any transfer of your data will be subject to a European Commission approved contract which will safeguard your privacy rights and give you remedies in the unlikely event of a security breach.
