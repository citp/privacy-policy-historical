                The exact information collected varies depending on the area you
                are using.</p>
                <p>When you order products from our site, we must know your
                name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and
                expiration date and tracking information from checks or money
                orders. This information is necessary to allow us to process
                your order and notify you of your order’s status.</p>
                <p>When you request a catalogue or other information, we must
                know your name, mailing address and e-mail address in order for
                us to properly forward your requested information. In addition,
                we may request additional information. However, such information
                will be purely optional and does not have to be answered in
                order to allow you to continue to use our site.</p>
                <p>When you participate in a contest or other promotional
                activity, we must know your name, mailing address and e-mail
                address so we can properly administer the contest and notify
                winners.</p>
                <p>In our online registration form, we require you to provide us
                with your full name, birthdate, e-mail address, a

                  <p>Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of

                  their use or disclosure of the personal information you
                  disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party
                  merchants and advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy
                  customs and policies. Since we do not control the privacy

                  confidentiality of your personal identifiable information,

                  <p>9. A Note To Parents and Children 13 and Younger.</p>
                  </b>
                  <p>Except as provided below, we do not knowingly collect
                  personally identifiable information from children 13 years old
                  or younger without prior verifiable parental consent. Before a
                  user who is 13 years or younger is allowed to complete this
                  registration process we ask that they provide us with their parent's
                  e-mail address and phone number. This is the minimum
                  information necessary to allow us to properly receive parental
                  consent in the manner provided below. Once we obtain parental
                  consent, a child will be asked to submit information at
                  different areas of our site, as outlined above, and that
                  information is used just as all the information we collect is
                  used, see paragraphs 2 and 3.</p>
                  <p>Parents may revoke their consent at any time and refuse to
                  allow further collection or use of their child’s
                  information. Further, parents may review and have us delete
                  any information submitted by their child. We are prohibited
                  from conditioning a child’s participation in an activity on
                  the child’s disclosing more personal information than is
                  reasonably necessary.</p>
                  <p>It is possible that we will collect a child’s name and
                  e-mail address for purposes of entering a child in a contest
                  or similar promotional activity. However, in any such
                  situation, we would also collect the parent’s e-mail address
                  so that we could notify the parent of the child’s entry in
                  the contest. The information collected in these cases would be
                  used only for purposes of the particular contest and will be
                  deleted when the particular promotion is completed. Similarly,
                  we would collect information and would contact the parent in
                  the event that a child subscribes to our on-line newsletter.
                  In either case, the parent has the right to have their child’s
                  information deleted from our database and prevent us from
                  contacting their child in the future. Finally, we may collect
                  a child’s e-mail address in order to allow us to respond to
                  a one-time request from your child. The child’s information
                  is deleted after we respond to this one-time request.</p>
                  <p>In the event that there is a material change in the
                  collection, use or disclosure policy we will send the parent
                  an e-mail message alerting them of this change and requesting
                  their consent to continue to collect their child’s
                  information.</p>

                  <p>10. Obtaining Parental Consent.</p>
                  </b>
                  <p>In order to obtain parental consent, we will ask a child
                  for their parent’s e-mail address and phone number. If the parent
                  has an e-mail address, we will ask for parental consent to
                  collect the child’s information via an e-mail message, along
                  with a follow-up message or telephone call to confirm that the
                  parent in fact did consent to collection of their child’s
                  information. If the parent does not have an e-mail address, we
                  will obtain parental consent by
                  calling the parent on the telephone, following the child’s
                  attempt to submit information to us.</p>
