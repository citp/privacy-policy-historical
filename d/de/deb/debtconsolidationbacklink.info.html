    <td><p align="left">Privacy Policy and Disclaimer</p>
      <p align="left">Our Commitment To Privacy</p>
      <p align="left">This Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we
        collect and use your personal information in connection with our<br>
        advertising, content, e-commerce, promotional and service programs and other
        business activities (the "Program") and to assist you in making informed
        decisions when using our site and our products and services and the sites of
        our advertisers.</p>
      <p align="left">What Information We Collect</p>
      <p align="left">When you visit our site we may collect two types of information: (a)
        personal information you actively choose to disclose and (b) information<br>
        about you that is collected automatically by our servers or obtained from
        third parties in a way not visible to you.(a) Information you actively choose to provide. By choosing to participate
        in our Program, you must become a Member by disclosing the following<br>
        information, such as: your email address, name, address, phone number and
        birth date. During the process of registering on our site, participating in
        various offers, completing surveys, or sending us emails or correspondence,
        we collect additional information that you may disclose, including for
        example mobile telephone number, fax number, payment information (e.g.,
        credit card number and billing address), credit information, social security
        number, health information and personal preferences regarding lifestyle,
        products or services.</p>
      <p align="left">(b) Passive information collected automatically by our servers or obtained
        from third parties. We collect some information about you simply by virtue
        of you connecting to our web site. Our servers automatically identify your
        computer by its internet protocol ("IP") address, a unique string of numbers
        that is assigned to your computer by your internet service provider. In addition, to participate in our program you must allow cookies to be active
        on your system. Cookies are a feature of web browser software (Internet
        Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Firefox, Opera, Safari, etc.) that allows web
        servers to recognize which computer is used to access a web site. Cookies
        simplify subsequent interactions on our site and streamline your
        transactions on related web pages. Information collected through cookies may
        include the date and time of your visits, the site pages you viewed, the
        time spent at each page, and the web sites you visited just before and just
        after our site. You can disable the cookie function by following the
        instructions in the "help" section of your browser. However, doing so will
        likely make it impossible for our system to properly recognize you when you
        visit our sites, and consequently may make your participation in our program
        more difficult or impossible. In addition to the information you provide or
        that is collected automatically from our system, we may obtain information
        about you from our marketing partners or other third parties, and we combine
        that information with the information you actively provide or that is
        automatically collected by our servers.</p>
      <p align="left">The term "Information" is used in this policy to refer to both types of
        information described above, as well as any Information that you provide to<br>
        us directly by phone (including any phone number displayed via caller ID),
        text or SMS message, U.S. mail or through any other written or oral<br>
        communication with us.</p>
      <p align="left">How We Use And Share The Information Collected</p>
      <p align="left">We use your Information to administer our business activities, provide
        customer services such as technical support, distribute information about<br>
        changes to our site, and send you, and enable others to send you,
        information about products and services that may be of interest to you and<br>
        to contact you or use your Information for any other purpose. We send
        communications to you ourselves, and your Information also is shared with
        other organizations that may contact you for any purpose by email, phone,
        text message, U.S. mail or any other means of communication.</p>
      <p align="left">OPT-IN NOTICE: By Participating, You Expressly "Opt In" To Receive
        Information And Grant Us Permission To Share Your Information</p>
      <p align="left">By signing up for our Program you expressly opt in to receive future
        information about products and services from us and from a variety of<br>
        advertisers to whom we may provide your Information. We will share your
        personal information with third parties, including our advertisers, for any
        reason we choose, including without limitation for the following purposes:
        (1) to operate our Program (including the transfer of the information to
        advertisers or to third parties who maintain on our behalf a list of persons
        having registered with our Program), (2) to permit advertisers or other
        third parties to use your Information for any purpose such as contacting you
        by email, phone, text message, U.S. mail or any other means of communication
        for any purpose, (3) to confirm you have completed all of the necessary
        steps to receive your gift, and (4) as we are required to do by law,
        including to notify the IRS that you received your gift. As a result, we
        will transfer your Information to third parties whose privacy policies and
        practices are beyond our control.In addition, in the event we consider a transaction involving the purchase<br>
        or sale of our assets or stock, other companies may review our records,
        including your Information, to make business decisions about the<br>
        transaction. Likewise, your Information may be transferred to third parties
        in the event of the sale or acquisition of our company or any of its assets.
        The parties who perform services for us (credit card processors, merchant
        banks, our internet service provider, etc.) also may have access to your
        information in performing their services.</p>
      <p align="left">Special Note About Information You Provide Directly To Our Advertisers.</p>
      <p align="left">You are able to access certain advertiser's sites through our site. When you
        opt to receive information or sign up for an offer from an advertiser, you
        may be doing so through third party sites and with other companies over
        which we have no control. You should read those sites' privacy policies to
        make sure you agree to them before using such sites. If you wish to opt out
        of those advertisers' mailings, you must do so directly with such
        advertisers or as otherwise provided on or through their sites.</p>
      <p align="left">Security Of Your Information.</p>
      <p align="left">We use reasonable technical efforts to prevent unauthorized access or
        disclosure, or accidental loss or destruction of Information. However,<br>
        nearly all Internet transmissions pass through many servers not controlled
        by us, and therefore we cannot guarantee that any information you provide us
        or we collect will not be intercepted or altered in that process. Also, as
        noted above, your Information is shared with third parties whose privacy
        policies and practices are beyond our control.How You Can Choose To "Opt Out" Of Receiving Further Information About<br>
        Products Or Services</p>
      <p align="left">If at any time you do not wish to receive further information about products
        or services from us and wish us to cease providing your Information to third
        parties, you may chose to "opt-out" through the Unsubscribe/"Opt-Out" page
        of our site.</p>
      <p align="left">Or by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in our newsletter emails.</p>
      <p align="left">We will promptly update our records upon receiving your clear instructions
        to opt-out, but it may take up to ten (10) business days from our receipt of
        your request for the change to be fully effective. If you late give us a
        clear statement that you want to receive emails from us or our advertisers
        after such date, then that opt-in statement will supersede any earlier
        opt-out request. If we have already provided your email address or other
        information to an advertiser or other third party before we receive your
        opt-out request, we cannot prevent them from sending or continuing to send
        you information or emails and you will need to contact such third party<br>
        directly.</p>
      <p align="left">How To Correct, Delete Or Access Your Information</p>
      <p align="left">If you wish to access, delete or correct the information you have provided
        to us through this site, please contact us through the Contact Us section of
        our site.</p>
      <p align="left">Special Rights For Residents Of Certain States</p>
      <p align="left">If you are a California resident or another state with specific laws
        relating to the collection and use of Information, you may have specific<br>
        rights not set forth in this policy. For example, California residents have
        the right to receive: a) information identifying any third party<br>
        company(ies) to whom we may have disclosed, within the past calendar year,
        personal information pertaining to you and your family for the company's
        direct marketing purposes; and b) a description of the categories of
        personal information disclosed. To obtain such information you must make a
        request in writing. Your request must include your name registration (email
        address), the site name you visited and a return address or it will not be
        processed. We will not honor such requests more than once per calendar year.
        Requests made via email will not be accepted. Please request our mailing
        address buy using the contact us page on this website.</p>
