# Privacy Policy - Demand Progress

Demand Progress/Demand Progress Action takes your privacy very seriously. We do not share your email address or other personal information with unauthorized entities without your permission.

We use the information we collect to inform you of news, activism opportunities, and other matters that relate to Demand Progress/Demand Progress Action, and to deliver petition signatures, emails/letters, and similar communications to designated targets.

For petitions, emails/letters, or similar public communications that you’ve signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information. We will not make your street or email address publicly available, but we may transmit such information to public officials/petition targets as part of a petition, open letter, or similar correspondence. (For instance, this information must be included to enable delivery of emails to members of Congress or comments to administrative agencies.)

DP (501(c)3 arm) and DPA (our 501(c)4 arm) have a resource sharing agreement that enables each to contact activists whose contact information was gathered by the other. Our 501(c4) arm and our 527 entity (also called Demand Progress) also have such a resource sharing agreement.  

DP/DPA owns and administers the Watchdog.net site. And as of the summer of 2013, DP/DPA owns and administers Rootstrikers.org. DP/DPA may contact subscribers to the Watchdog.net and Rootstrikers.org sublists. You may unsubscribe from email alerts from any or all of DP/DPA, Rootstrikers.org, or Watchdog.net at any time. 

If you enter your information as part of an action that is organized in partnership with one or more other organizations, and labeled as such, then we may share your name, email, and other information you have entered with the partner organization(s) for that particular action. We house data in accounts we hold with vendors such as ActionKit and Action Network. We sometimes enlist third-party vendors to help us manage data.  We may use cookies from third parties such as Google Adwords to serve ads based on usage of this site.

If you sign up to volunteer—for example by submitting your phone number in a volunteer signup field—we may share your contact information with partner organizations, third party services, or other volunteers, for the purposes of volunteer coordination.

DP is a fiscally sponsored project of the New Venture Fund, and DPA is a fiscally sponsored project of the New Venture Fund.
