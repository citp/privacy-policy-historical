# Privacy Policy « THUS

At THUS Limited, we are committed to protecting the privacy of everyone who visits one of our web sites.

The FAQs below explain our privacy policy and how it applies to web sites operated by THUS Limited unless otherwise stated. This policy does NOT apply to our customers’ web sites. Even where allowed by this policy, THUS Limited will not use your personal data in such a way as to breach the Data Protection Act or any other relevant UK legislation.

This policy may change from time to time, without notice. Please check this web site (http://www.thus.net/legal/privacypolicy) for the latest version.

### 1\. What information does THUS Limited collect from me when I visit a THUS Limited website?

THUS Limited uses Google Analytics to monitor visitor information. This means that we have access to statistical information about accesses to our sites, which typically means the number of hits, how long visitors stay on our site as well as other information which is publicly available when you access the Internet. You can find out more about what Google Analytics reports on the website http:// www.google.com/analytics. We may also store web server logs which show your IP address (the Internet number which your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet) or the IP address of the web proxy you use. In addition we may store other information your Web browser passes to us including what you looked at, what you previously looked at, whether the page request was successful or not, and which browser you used to view the pages. Finally, users of the www.thus.net site will also have the following information recorded about their visit by the LivePerson application (online chat) using tracker tags: IP address, ISP, current browsing page, geolocation and any other attributes you enter onto forms during the LivePerson chat session.

### 2\. What does THUS Limited do with web log and Google Analytics information?

Generally, this data is used strictly for statistical purposes only. This helps us understand which areas of the site are of particular interest and also whether your request to view a page was successful. It also tells us how many hits and page requests we get.

### 3\. What about the web tracking logs?

The information collected by the live chat tracker is used to inform our support staff if you connect to the chat service to help us provide the best support we can based on what parts of the site you were looking at.

### 4\. How long does THUS Limited keep log information?

We process the logs into statistical form on a daily basis. The original logs are destroyed after two months. We may correlate your accesses on different dates within this two-month period to gain further information such as which pages people visit regularly. This is only used in statistical form. Google Analytics data is kept in line with Google’s retention policy. In terms of the data we have access to it is kept for up to 25 months. This chat tracker data is stored by LivePerson (http://www.liveperson.com/) on their servers in the US for up to 13 months and is only used to provide information during your chat session if you opt to use LivePerson to speak to one of our employees.

### 5\. Are there any other ways that you may track which Web pages I look at?

From time to time we may make use of ‘tracking tags’, which appear as small images on a web page. When you look at a web page containing one of these tags, our web log is updated to show this. These log entries are handled in the manner described above, just like all other entries. We use these to track the take-up of specific promotions available from the web site.

### 6\. Does THUS Limited share its web access log with anyone else?

We will not share any of the information collected from your accesses to our site with anyone outside THUS Limited. However, it is possible that we may supply aggregate statistical information to third parties for statistical analysis purposes. Also, from time to time we contract out work relating to tracking of trends and which web pages are visited regularly to third parties. In all cases when this happens we will only use a reputable company and will have a contract in place with them that only allows the processing of your access data for our statistical analysis. This contract will also require that all this data be deleted when the analysis is completed. Except as provided for in the preceding paragraph, we will never release information about the activities of an individually identifiable person or IP address except in response to a court order or if we are required to do so by law.

### 7\. What about cookies?

A cookie is a small amount of data, which is sent to your browser by the Web server, stored on your computer, and then sent back when you subsequently look at pages on that server. They are usually used to help remember who you are and what interests you. Generally, THUS Limited uses cookies (or similar mechanisms) to track your use of the site and to maintain a record of your visit to enhance the experience of using the site (including to customise your visit to our website). It is also possible that third parties we use to monitor usage of our websites may make use of cookies to collect more information about the visit, such as the date and time, which pages users visited etc. This information gathered helps us to continually develop our websites to ensure that you can easily access the information you need.

### 8\. What if I click on a banner link?

All banners on our website relate to THUS Limited and our Demon branded products or services. We do not provide any banners that link to third party sites. Any banners in emails we may send will also track your visit to the THUS Limited site.

### 9\. What happens if I enter a competition or apply for a special offer?

From time to time THUS Limited or one of our associates may run competitions or special offers from a THUS Limited web site. Entry into the competitions and application for the special offers usually requires you to enter personal data such as your name, address, email address and telephone numbers. We may also ask you for some general information about your Internet activity for statistical research. At all times there will be a notice that forms part of the entry rules which states what the information is collected for, what it will be used for and who (if anyone) the information is passed to. You will always be offered an option to opt out of your data being used for anything other than entry in the competition or special offer, although this will normally require you to tick a box.

### 10\. How secure is any personal data that I submit?

All data collected from the site – such as web site access logs, competition entry information, or special offer information – is stored in a secure environment which is protected from unauthorised access, improper use, alteration and unlawful or accidental loss or destruction.

### 11\. How long is any personal data kept?

If we do ask you for any personal data (name, address, telephone numbers, email addresses, etc.) for competition or offer purposes then we will only store this data for up to 12 months after the end of the competition or offer, after which it will be destroyed.

### 12\. What if I sign up for a service online?

We will ask for the minimum amount of data that is required for us to set up the service and, where applicable, to bill you for the service you use. Typically, this means we collect your name, email address, address, phone number(s) and credit card number with (expiration date) and any discount code details. We may use your information in a number of ways, including the following:

  * To confirm your order and provide status updates;
  * To improve and personalise your online experience;
  * To improve the content on our website (by use of cookies);
  * For marketing and promotional purposes (you may opt out of this during the order process); and
  * For customer service purposes, to contact customers who have completed their order, or to follow up on abandoned orders (to see if there was a problem with the site).



As part of the sign-up process, any credit or debit card details will be passed to an automated credit checking service and will be encrypted. This data will be kept for the lifetime of your contract with THUS Limited.

### 13\. What if I use a web-based service?

None of your account information, including passwords, is stored when you use our web-based service such as webmail or the password changing service. As with visits to our other pages, we will store web logs for these pages.

### 14\. How do you record whether I have given consent for you to use my data?

We maintain databases of the information you submit. If you have opted not to consent to any additional use of your data, then this will be flagged in these databases and we will not contact you for any reason other than those stated in questions 11 and 12 at the time you submit your information.
