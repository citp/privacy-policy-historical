**DEMANDWARE COMMERCE SERVICES**

Demandware provides our customers with a hosted eCommerce platform and application suite of services that facilitate functionality to support the development and management of eCommerce services. The eCommerce services are not a part of our corporate web site. Demandware serves as a Data Processor for our customers who use these services. More specifically, Demandware does not own the information that is submitted to our customers' websites. The information that is submitted to a Web site of one of our customers will be subject to that customer's privacy policy. The following information discloses how information is submitted to these websites and how Demandware will handle the information for our customers who are the owners of this data.

_Web Visitors (eCommerce Customers)_  
Demandware processes Personal Information about a visitor to our customers' websites ("Visitors") only when the Visitor chooses to provide such information. On certain pages, for example, a Visitor may be required to provide his/her personal information such as his/her name, address, phone number and e-mail address in order to complete a transaction or perform a requested service.

_Employees_  
Demandware employees may process Personal Information from our customers' employees for, among other things, application access and authentication.

**Onward Transfer**  
__Sharing of Visitors' Personal Information__  
We may contract with third-party providers to perform certain functions on behalf of our customers to enhance our existing product and service offerings, such as product and service support.

These third parties may have access to Visitors' Personal Information as necessary to permit them to perform their functions. They are bound by confidentiality agreements or similar contractual restrictions with respect to any information that is provided to them and they are prohibited from using the information for other purposes.

_Web Site / Cookies_  
In order to improve the content and format of our platform and applications, our eCommerce Services use Web site tracking software to automatically capture technical information that is then stored in our servers' log files. This information may include, but is not limited to, user domain, the type of Internet browser being used, which of our customers' Web pages are visited, and the amount of time spent on our customers' sites.

Our customers' website pages may contain "cookies." A cookie is a small amount of data which a Web site stores on a Visitor's computer, and which we or our customers can later retrieve. The cookie cannot be read by a site other than ours or our customer's. We and our customers use cookies for a number of administrative purposes, such as to store Visitors' preferences for certain kinds of information. Any use of cookies by our customers will be governed by our customers' privacy policies. Visitors can monitor use of cookies on their computers by setting their Web browser to inform them when cookies are set, or Visitors can prevent the cookies from being set entirely. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser provide notice when a new cookie is received, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please understand that if a Visitor disables the use of cookies, the Visitor may be unable to access certain portions or services in our applications or those of our customers.

**Security**  
To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Visitors' Personal Information that is processed by our services, Demandware utilizes a variety of industry standard physical and logical access controls, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, network and database monitoring, and backup systems. We use SSL encrypted sessions when processing or transferring sensitive data through platform and applications.

We limit access to Visitors' Personal Information and data to those persons who have a specific business purpose for maintaining and processing such information. Demandware employees who have been granted physical access to a Visitor's Personal Information have been made aware of their responsibilities to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information and have been provided training and instruction on how to do so.

**Access**  
Demandware will support our customers in taking reasonable steps to ensure that Visitor's Personal Information is accurate, complete, and current to its intended use. We provide our customers with reasonable access to the Personal Information that they provide to us, as well as the ability to review, correct or request the deletion of such information.

**Data Retention**

We and our customers may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and as otherwise set forth in our respective customer's privacy policy. We and our customers may retain and use your information as reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our rights and as otherwise set forth in our respective customer's privacy policy.

**Links to Non-Demandware Web Sites and Third Parties**

Demandware Customer Web sites may contain links to third-party sites for Visitors' convenience and/or information. If a Visitor accesses those links, he/she will leave the Demandware customer's website and be re-directed to a third-party site. Demandware does not control those sites or the privacy practices of those third-party sites, which may differ from Demandware's privacy practices and those of our customer. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party Web sites, and the personal data Visitors choose to provide to third-party Web sites is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage Visitors to review the privacy policy of any Web site or company before submitting their Personal Information to it.
