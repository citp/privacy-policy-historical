Demandbase provides its customers with insights and data on companies and information about business clients and prospects in addition to various services that use that data. 

This privacy policy describes how we handle the information that you supply to us directly and through the Demandbase Technology; the Demandbase ABM Platform; the www.demandbase.com website and our affiliated website, www.abmleadershipalliance.com (“Demandbase Sites”); Demandbase’s collection and use of data obtained through third-party websites that utilize Demandbase Technology, such as beacons or cookies (“Partner Sites”), including the data received through third-party publisher sites through our advertising services. 

This privacy policy does not apply to data collection and use by Partner Sites, including customers of Demandbase, or any third parties, such as publishers that display ads served by Demandbase. For details on a particular Partner Site or third-party site and its data collection, please visit such website’s privacy policy. 

### 1\. DATA COLLECTION BY DEMANDBASE

#### a. Automatic Data Collection

  * **Demandbase Sites.** Demandbase collects data from you automatically when you visit Demandbase Sites through the use of web beacons and cookies. We automatically receive data from your browser, including the Tag Data (described below) in addition to other data we use to manage and optimize our website. For more details on the cookies we use, visit our [Cookie Policy](https://www.demandbase.com/cookies/). For customers with access to the Demandbase ABM Platform, we collect transactional information about usage, such as authentication, analytics, and other information to provide the ABM Platform. Demandbase also deploys its own technology on Demandbase Sites, which may enable it to provide you with a more personalized experience when you visit Demandbase Sites.
  * **Demandbase Technology and Partner Sites.** When Demandbase technology is deployed on a Partner Site, the Demandbase ABM Platform automatically receives data from the Partner Site through the use of web beacons, and in certain configurations, through the use of tracking pixels and cookies (“Tag Data”). For Partner Sites, we automatically collect Tag Data from your browser. Some of the Tag Data collected may be considered personal data in your jurisdiction, such as IP address and online identifiers (cookies) and some may be considered non-personal information, such as browser version, operating system, pages viewed from a site where Demandbase Technology is deployed, and timestamps.
  * **Demandbase Advertising Solutions.** For its advertising solutions, Demandbase automatically receives data from its publisher and supply partners when it decides on whether to provide an ad to an end-user. Some of the information Demandbase receives may be considered personal information in your jurisdiction, such as online identifiers, location, and IP address and some may be considered non-personal information, such as browser version, operating system, pages viewed, and timestamps.



In some cases or in specific jurisdictions, the Demandbase Sites, Partner Sites, or other third-party sites on which we display ads may only permit the Demandbase Technology to receive data from you after you provide consent to cookies or the use of Demandbase Technology. 

#### b. Information You Supply to Us

Through the Demandbase Site, including Demandbase sponsored marketing and promotions, you may be able to provide contact information, billing information, ask questions, register, or provide other information, some of which may be considered personal data that directly or indirectly identifies you, such as your name, email address, and contact details. We may also offer interactive functionality, such as forms or chat, that enable us or a third party service provider to collect data or interact with you. 

Through the Demandbase ABM Platform, in certain configurations, customers may be able to provide additional data, including their authorized users’ and clients’ contact information. Demandbase uses this information only to provide customers with services and as otherwise agreed to in their respective agreements. Demandbase may derive insights from usage of these features and types of insight typically derived from customer usage and customer-provided data, but does not use any customer-provided data except to provide its services. If your account on the Demandbase ABM Platform is managed by an administrator, that account administrator may have control with regards to how your account information is retained and deleted. Administrators are able to request the deactivation of an account made for you through your company.

Through the Demandbase partner portal (available to select Demandbase partners), partners may provide their own and their authorized users’ and clients’ contact information. These partners may also provide demographic information and use the partner portal to conduct outreach. 

The provision of information is sometimes required by law and at other times is a result of a contractual requirement. You may be required to provide information, for example in a case where we sign a contract with you, and the non-provision of information could, in certain circumstances, prevent a transaction from concluding. 

#### c. Data Collected from Other Sources

We may receive data about you from sources other than from Demandbase Sites, such as third-party partners, email campaigns, public sources, and marketing partners. Such third-party data may include demographic information, company information, and personal data such as contact details. We may also generate or receive predicted data about business users such as characteristics, interests, or business buying behavior. 

#### d. Technology We Use

For automatic data collection, Demandbase uses tracking pixels, web beacons, and cookies to collect information. Demandbase may use these technologies either alone or in conjunction with each other.

  * **Tracking pixels** are small javascript graphic images utilized to track a user, typically for advertising or analytics purposes, including third-party pixels for tracking the effectiveness of email campaigns. 
  * **Web beacons** , often used synonymously with tracking pixels, include javascript (or other programming languages) that allow data to be exchanged between systems, typically through the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
  * **Cookies** are small text files that your browser stores on your computer hard drive that enable a site to remember you or your preferences; cookies cannot access, read, or modify any other data on a computer. Through your browser settings, you may be able to manage your cookie settings. Demandbase uses cookies for advertising and analytics purposes, such as to identify returning business visitors and show them customized content, for more details, refer to the [Demandbase Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookies).



### 2\. DATA USE BY DEMANDBASE AND LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING DATA FOR THE EEA

#### a. Data Use by Demandbase 

Demandbase uses data in the following ways:

  * **For providing and improving its services.** Demandbase uses data, including the Tag Data in most situations, to operate, improve, and personalize its business and services, including the Demandbase ABM Platform and the Demandbase Sites. This use includes deriving insights, trends, use, and analytics, whether actual or predicted, from the data collected. Demandbase may also work with third parties to receive data or insights and combine that information with the data and insights provided by Demandbase. When providing our services, Demandbase often uses the data it collects with other data in our possession (such as actual or predicted demographic, location, or publicly available information) or customer-provided data as part of our services. For example, Demandbase may use information to provide customers with support or improve accuracy and develop new features based on historical use and trends.
  * **Advertising and Marketing for itself and customers.** Demandbase also uses the data it collects for advertising and marketing, such as analyzing and predicting business buying behavior or business interests and delivering interest-based advertising and content to your device, such as ads, widgets, or website content tailored to you on behalf of advertisers, across websites, devices, and over time. When collecting contact details like email address, such as through marketing offers, Demandbase uses the data to communicate with you about offers, events, services, or products by us and partners. Demandbase may also use the Tag Data for such purposes. Demandbase may combine the information it has with third-party data, including data that may directly or indirectly identify you, for improving the personalization of ads. 
  * **As required by applicable law, legal process, or regulation.** Demandbase may use all data it collects or receives as required under law, legal or financial processes like audits, or regulations.
  * **To Provide Reporting.** Using the Tag Data combined with additional data in its possession, Demandbase may create reports (such as performance analytics, statistics, metrics, and other details) for Demandbase customers on the companies that visit their websites as well as actual or predicted interests for those visitors. Demandbase may also use the Tag Data collected to carry out actions requested by our customers, such as combining data with additional data in our possession or provided by customers or using data to retarget specific companies’ users with personalized advertising. 
  * **For running its business.** Demandbase uses the information it collects for billing, account management, invoicing, investigating security and privacy incidents, as well as other legitimate business interests.



Where we intend to process your personal data for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was collected, we will provide you with information regarding the purpose for the processing, as well as other relevant information, prior to processing your personal data for the new purpose.

#### b. EU Legal Bases for Processing Data 

Depending on the circumstances, Demandbase will use different legal bases to process personal data. For example, in some jurisdictions, when a user explicitly consents, then Demandbase may place cookies on the user’s machine. In other circumstances, Demandbase processes personal data to fulfill a contract (such as managing its customers), when required to do so by law, or if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party. Demandbase may also process data when it’s in Demandbase’s legitimate interests. Demandbase will only use the legitimate interests basis to process data in the event that such interests are not overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. A few examples of these legitimate interests may be to provide its services, process data, conduct direct marketing, and maintain security.

#### c. Retention

Demandbase may retain data collected through its services for customers as follows:

  * In logs used for troubleshooting, reporting, and for providing its services, for approximately 13 months;
  * For CRM data synched within the Demandbase ABM Platform, Demandbase stores the data for 30 days after the contract period end unless a customer requests an earlier deletion;
  * For other business purposes (like technical developments) for a period necessary to achieve the purpose of the storage and as permitted by law.



After this, Demandbase may either aggregate, anonymize or pseudonymize data it collects, such as the Tag Data, so that it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and use it for any business purpose. However, Demandbase may retain this information in a form where it is reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person for longer periods of time when required under law. 

### 3\. DATA SHARING BY DEMANDBASE

#### a. Demandbase shares information with third parties for the following purposes:

  * **With customers and partners.** For example, Demandbase shares information to provide the Demandbase ABM Platform, its services, or technology. Demandbase also shares information, including information derived from the Tag Data, for marketing, advertising, and engagement with their customers, such as market research, providing interest-based advertising (including retargeting or remarketing), analytics, and advertising and marketing optimization. A customer may choose to link the Tag Data from their own website with additional personal data in their possession. Customers may also take actions within the Demandbase ABM Platform and elect to have insights and data shared with third party integrations.
  * **Improving Ad Personalization.** Demandbase may share Tag Data (specific to a customer when requested by that customer) or data collected from third party sources and use that data to create targeting segments to enable companies to better personalize advertising. If Demandbase shares such data, then except for online identifiers and IP address, it will only share any personal data collected in hashed form with authorized third parties.
  * **Business Activities.** Demandbase shares information for its legitimate business needs, for example, in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company or any other similar business, audit, or legal disclosure need. Demandbase may also share information with third party vendors (such as marketing, billing, or security service providers), consultants, and other service providers who work on our behalf and need access to your information to carry out their work for us and may use your information in connection with the provision of such services.
  * **Security.** Demandbase may share information for security, fraud prevention, law and policy enforcement purposes, such as responding to legal matters or law enforcement requests or enforcing our policies and terms, protecting rights, property, and safety of individuals or other third parties.

Demandbase adheres to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

The DAA opt-out requires the ability to set an opt-out cookie in your browser. Your opt-out choices only apply to the particular browser and device from which you have opted-out (ex. work computer vs. personal computer) and only to the applicable advertising channel (you may still receive interest-based advertising in-app or email marketing if you opt-out via web browser cookies) or otherwise not via cookies. Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies or change your cookie preferences, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. Cookie-based opt-out preferences do not apply to the Demandbase Technology used to personalize web content to companies.
