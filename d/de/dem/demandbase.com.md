# Privacy :: Demandbase :: B2B Marketing, Account-Based Targeting and Personalization Platform

## Privacy Policy

### Driving stronger privacy across the industry is an essential part of the Demandbase strategy.

Demandbase is a Real-time Targeting and Personalization platform for B2B. Demandbase works by identifying the companies that are visiting a website, and then by making that insight actionable in your existing Marketing and Sales programs and technologies. Demandbase offers Company-Targeted display advertising, website engagement and conversion modules, and CRM integration for a consistent view of account behavior across our client's digital presence. The Demandbase platform does this without placing cookies on browser hard drives and without the use of behavioral targeting or any personally identifiable information about a web visitor. “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that identifies you personally, including, without limitation, your name, e-mail address, password, login ID and other contact information that you voluntarily submit to us. Demandbase does not use cookies for ad serving.

**Anti-Abuse**

If you suspect a client of abusing our services, please contact us at [abuse@demandbase.com](mailto:abuse@demandbase.com). All complaints are investigated, and you will receive a response on the action we will take to resolve the issue.

**Partners**

Demandbase has aligned with recognized leaders in the digital and direct marketing industry and hopes to influence how practices are shaped in the future. Please contact us at [privacy@demandbase.com](mailto:privacy@demandbase.com) to learn more.

**Cookies**

Demandbase does employ cookies at Demandbase.com in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. Cookies are small text files placed in the 'Cookies' folder on a visitor's hard disk and allow Demandbase to remember the visitor. The cookies placed by the Demandbase server are readable only by Demandbase, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. All web-browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie. If a visitor refuses the Demandbase cookie, Demandbase does not gather any information on that visitor, but doing so will require you to re-enter certain information at each visit, or prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

### **How Demandbase uses and protects your personal information.**

**Scope**

This privacy policy describes how we handle the personal information that you supply to us and/or concerning your use of our services available through the [www.demandbase.com](http://www.demandbase.com/page-not-found/) Web site (the “Site”) and applies generally to any affiliated Web sites. By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy is effective on August 1, 2006 for any current users, and upon acceptance for all new users.

**Collection of Personal Information**

The Demandbase Site will gather information such as what kind of browser visitors are on, what operating system they are using, their IP address, cookie information, time stamp (time page accessed as well as timespent per web page) and their clickstream information (for example, which pages they have viewed and how long they have been there). Note that information is only gathered while the visitor is on the Site. Demandbase monitors how a visitor arrives at the Site, but cannot and will not gather information about other third party sites the user has visited. Demandbase automatically receives and records such information on our server logs from your browser.

In certain sections of the Site, Demandbase may invite you to contact us to pose questions, request information, or complete a registration form. We may ask for Personally Identifiable Information to beentered as a means of registration before accessing a certain part of the Site.

Visitors of the Site can also choose not to enter any of their Personally Identifiable Information.

Demandbase may also collect Personally Identifiable Information when you use certain Demandbase services, through the use of the Site or hypersite web pages, or when you enter promotions or contests offered by Demandbase on and through the Site.

When you visit the Demandbase Websites, we collect information, including PII that you provide, in order to provide you with the products and services you requested or with offers or promotions that may interest you, service your accounts, and save you time and better respond to your needs.

Use of the Demandbase platform on a client website is subject to the client's privacy statement and will apply to their use of PII. Please consult with our client's privacy policy if you have questions about the client's use of the Demandbase platform or your PII within their Site.

**Marketing**

We don't sell or rent the personal information we collect from your using our Site to third parties for their marketing purposes. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies (such as demographic data) to improve and personalize the services provided to you. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications from us, simply "unsubscribe" from email communication using the link located at the end of all marketing communication.

**Use of Information**

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with an efficient and customized experience. You agree that we may use your personal information to:

  * provide the services and customer support you request;
  * resolves disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
  * prevent prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement;
  * customize, measure, and improve our services and the Site's content and layout;
  * share service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences.



**Our Disclosure of Your Information**   

  * we may disclose personal information as required to respond to legal matters, enforce our policies, or protect individual rights, property, or safety;
  * to employees and agents of Demandbase in order to help detect and prevent prohibited or illegal acts;
  * to service providers under contract who help with our business operations;
  * to other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information;
  * to those serving apparently valid subpoenas;
  * to other business entities, should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity.



Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy we will not otherwise disclose your personal information except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity. ** **

**Account Protection**

Your password is the key to your account. We recommend the use of unique numbers, letters, and special characters in combination and that you not disclose your Demanbase password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify us and change your password. 

**Security**

Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use certain tools (including but not limited to encryption, passwords, and physical security) to protect you personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we take all reasonable steps to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

**Phishing**

In order to protect yourself from third parties unlawfully seeking your personal information through email that appears to be from Demandbase, you should never provide any personal information directly in response to an email you believe you have received from us. Rather, you should always close any such email, open your browser, log directly in to the Demandbase Site and change, update or modify and such personal information only using our Site. In the event that you believe that you have received a request for personal information in an email message that is made to appear that it was sent by us, please inform us immediately. 

**General**

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the Site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site.
