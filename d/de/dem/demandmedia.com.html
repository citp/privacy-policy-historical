B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pixel Tags.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we email you, our emails may use “pixel tags” to determine if your email software or site can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the size of our email messages and conserve bandwith). C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection of Information by Third Parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the advertisers and other businesses that advertise or place other content our Site use cookies on our Site and may place a cookie on your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The content posted by these businesses will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we may use third party advertising companies to serve ads.&nbsp;&nbsp;These companies (1) use information obtained from your visits to this Site and other sites to serve ads to you and (2) place unique third party cookies on your browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we use web beacons provided by third party advertising companies to help optimize our advertising. Web beacons enable us to recognize your browser when a cookie has been placed on your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some but not all third party advertising companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information and an identification of advertisers that provide an opt-out mechanism, please click the following:&nbsp;http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. The information collected by third party cookies is subject to the privacy policy of the third party, not this Policy. D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Contests.&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we may host a promotion, sweepstake, or contest on the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer to a third party of your personal information in connection with such promotion, sweepstake or contest.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be disclosed at the point of collection or transfer who is collection or transferring the information and whose privacy statement applies, and it will be your choice whether or not you wish to permit such transfer to our collection of personal information by a third party. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OUR USE AND RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION. A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of Personal Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;We use personal information that you submit to us for such purposes as responding to your requests; monitoring and providing the Site; enforcing our rights and the rights of third parties, and investigating and ensuring compliance with theTerms. B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of Other Information. We use other information about our users for purposes such as measuring the number of visitors to sections of our Site, making the Site more useful to visitors and delivering targeted advertising and non-advertising content.&nbsp;&nbsp;We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate, non-personally identifiable use. C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retention of Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;We retain&nbsp;information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of information. 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OUR SHARING OF INFORMATION.&nbsp;&nbsp;Demand Media shares information with third parties, but only as described in this Section 4. A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisers and Others.&nbsp;&nbsp;We share non-personally identifiable information with advertisers, site providers, and other persons with whom we conduct business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, these advertisers, site providers, and other persons may share with us information about you that they have independently developed or acquired. B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Third Parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;We contract with affiliated and non-affiliated third parties to provide sites to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include providing marketing assistance and analyzing data. These third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions. C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Transfer.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets, or engage in acquisitions, mergers, restructurings, changes of control, or similar transactions. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, customer information may be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession and then to a subsequent purchaser. D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affiliates.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may share user information with our corporate affiliates. Corporate affiliates are those entities that we control, are controlled by us, or are under common control with us and any joint venture in which any of the controlled entities may participate from time to time.

C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identity Theft.&nbsp;If you believe that you are a victim of identity theft entitled by law to request information from us, write us at our Legal Notice address (see Section 9) and we will let you know what additional information you must provide to us.&nbsp;After we have received that information, we will supply without charge the information legally required to be disclosed that we then have, subject to applicable law and reserving all of our rights and defenses. 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTACT INFORMATION AND INFORMATION ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF OUR POLICY.&nbsp;For customer site matters (including questions relating to this Policy), you may email us atlegal@demandmedia.com.
