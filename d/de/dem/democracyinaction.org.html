    <div class="content"><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>DemocracyInAction.org respects each individual's right to personal privacy. We will not share your information with any third-party organization without your explicit permission to do so. Personal information you provide is stored in a secure location and is accessible only by designated staff. We will collect and use information through our Web site only in the ways disclosed in this statement.</p>
<h3>Information Collection and Usage</h3>
<p>DemocracyInAction.org collects two types of information: optional and/or voluntary information that users provide; and information that is automatically recorded in a standard, web server log file each time a page request is made.</p>
<p>Optional and/or voluntary information is provided by users when they take action on a member organization's campaign, donation, signup or other page created within the DIA system. This information belongs to the member organization and will not be used by DemocracyInAction for any purpose other than aggregate statistics.</p>
<p>DemocracyInAction.org offers a monthly electronic newsletter to its member organizations and anyone who subscribes directly on our website. We may also use this information to send emails regarding new services or features, or to send system alerts or other pertinent information. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we always present the option to unsubscribe from our communications.</p>
<p>DemocracyInAction.org member organizations have all agreed to adhere to our strict privacy policy and will not share with a third party any personally identifiable information gathered from pages created in the DIA system without the express consent of its users.</p>
<p>We do NOT collect personally identifying information that users divulge about other people, such as the information provided in our tell-a-friend feature.</p>
<p>DemocracyInAction.org does not actively market to children, and we never knowingly ask a child under 13 to divulge personal information.</p>
<p>We may collect demographic data through automatic logging files in order to enhance the usefulness of our site.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A "cookie" is a small file assigning you a unique ID that is placed on your computer by a web server. DemocracyInAction's web site uses cookies within our action centers in order to identify the action taker and make it easier to take action. We may also from time to time use cookies on the homepage so that frequent visitors are not presented a pop-up window each time they visit.</p>
<h3>Linking</h3>
<p>We offer links to other websites. Please note: When you click on links to other websites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Their standards may differ from ours.</p>
<p>Our website will offer forums and message boards. Please be advised that information posted in these venues becomes public knowledge.</p>
<h3>Access to Information</h3>
<p>Users may access their own personal information and contact us about inaccuracies they may find. Users may delete their information or edit their personal profile. Subscribers can remove their names from our subscriber list at any time.</p>
<h3>Problem Resolution</h3>
<p>If problems arise, users may contact DemocracyInAction.org by emailing us at info@democracyinaction.org. We are committed to resolving disputes within 72 hours.</p>
<h3>Data Storage and Security</h3>
<p>The data we gather from users is stored on our servers along with everything else on our servers, and the same security measures protect users' data as protect our own internal data. We use industry-standard methods to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your personal information. Please note, however, that while there is no such thing as "perfect security" anywhere on the Net, we protect your data just as we protect our own. Furthermore, access to personal data is restricted within the company, and that all employees are aware that personal data is private.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions about privacy or security, please contact us by sending an email to: info@democracyinaction.org.</p>
<h3>Your Choice to Opt-Out</h3>
<p>DemocracyInAction.org provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us. If you do not wish to receive such communications, please either click 'unsubscribe' at the bottom of the communication, or send email to info@democracyinaction.org.</p>
<p>DemocracyInAction.org reserves its right to modify this privacy policy at any time.</p>
