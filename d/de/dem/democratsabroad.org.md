# Privacy Policy - Democrats Abroad

(effective June 21, 2018)

The Democratic Party Committee Abroad, doing business as Democrats Abroad (also known as “DA”), is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. Democrats Abroad collects different types of information from you when you use our web-based services ("Services").

This Privacy Policy and our [**Cookies Policy**](https://www.democratsabroad.org/cookies) will help explain what information we collect, how we use it and what options you have in relation to it.

The key points of our Privacy Policy are provided in the summary below. However, you can also learn more by simply following the links below or by continuing to scroll down:

### **Privacy Policy Summary**

At Democrats Abroad, we are committed to protecting your privacy online. Democrats Abroad will hold any information you provide us here with the utmost care, with appropriate security measures in place that protect the confidentiality of your personal information. Democrats Abroad will use the information you provide for the following purposes: to validate your membership; to provide you with access to “members only” sections of the Democrats Abroad website; to allow Democrats Abroad officers as appropriate to contact you with voting reminders and with information about upcoming activities in your Democrats Abroad chapter and/or interest group(s); and to allow you, should you so wish and only with your consent, to participate actively in the “members only” sections of the website. Should you choose to contribute to the Democrats Abroad posts, your login name will appear along with your text. You can change this default setting and change your login name to something else if you would like. To register as a member of Democrats Abroad, we will not ask you for any sensitive information (such as social security number, driver’s license or passport number), and we not otherwise maintain any information about you that you have not freely provided to us.

Democrats Abroad is the official Democratic Party organization for millions of Americans living outside the United States. Recognized as a "state" party by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Democrats Abroad is represented on the DNC by eight voting members and sends voting delegates to the quadrennial Democratic National Convention. Because Democrats Abroad operates as an official Democratic Party organization, its membership is limited to Americans living overseas, that is outside the United States and its territories. Further, membership is limited to overseas Americans who are or will be eligible to vote in the next federal election. That is why we ask that members provide their full name, current address or phone number and the state in which they vote, to declare that they are U.S. citizens, and to declare that they subscribe to the principles of the Democratic Party of the United States. Except for the purpose of assisting officers (such as your elected country chair and authorized Democrats Abroad staff) in administrating your membership as described in this privacy policy, your personal information will not be shared with other members of Democrats Abroad without your consent.

If you join Democrats Abroad, you will have given us permission to transfer your name, contact information, and any voting state information you may have provided to the Democrats Abroad membership database, and have agreed to this privacy statement. You may revise or update your information at any time by going to your “my profile” link on the website.

If you choose at any time to make a donation to Democrats Abroad, you may be identified as a donor on our membership database, but your financial information will not be entered or held on this database. Your financial information will be securely archived by a trusted third party in compliance with federal laws and regulations.

Democrats Abroad will not use any information provided to us here for any purpose other than in connection with your membership in Democrats Abroad and the activities of Democrats Abroad. If you have chosen to provide your voting residence information, Democrats Abroad will send you additional information about voting in your last state of residence as it becomes available. Democrats Abroad will not disclose your information to third parties for any other purpose unless we first obtain your consent, except as required by applicable law or regulation. Democrats Abroad may use aggregate information about its members for statistical reports, but it will not be possible to identify you from such reports.

Any information that you provide to the Democrats Abroad membership database will be collected and transferred to the database stored on a secure server maintained by the Democratic Party Committee Abroad. Democrats Abroad is committed to providing your information with a very high level of privacy protection. You should be aware, however, that applicable laws and regulations protecting personal information in the United States may not be the same as that provided in other jurisdictions, including those that belong to the European Economic Area.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, the information we have collected from you online, the practices of this site or your interaction with this website, please send an email to: privacy@democratsabroad.org

You may also contact us directly by U.S. mail at Privacy Internet Operations Division, Democrats Abroad, PO Box 15130, Washington, DC 20003, USA.

Your registration information enables us to provide you with access to our Services under the agreements we have with you.

We will also use and analyze information on transactions on your account for our legitimate interests by data matching or statistical analysis so that we can administer, support, improve and develop our Services and to help us detect and prevent fraud, or other illegal activities, or acts prohibited by our terms of service or any policies applicable to the Services.

In some cases, we use this information to send you communications based on your interests.

We also use technical and device information to operate and improve our Services, measure our effectiveness, set up and maintain accounts, identify and fix errors and to help keep online content fair and safe and to resolve related disputes.

### 4.When we share information

We may share the information we collect about you (subject to the necessary security, contractual and transfer safeguards).  In delivering Services to you, we may share your personal information with:

  * Authorized officers or volunteers of Democrats Abroad. The Democrats Abroad membership database is maintained, and personal information is processed, by authorized officers and volunteers at various levels of the organization, including the global, country, chapter, and other levels; only authorized members of Democrats Abroad are granted access to personal information of other members, subject to limitations and restrictions intended to protect your privacy. At the global level, your information may be accessed by authorized officers or volunteers of Democrats Abroad anywhere in the world, but they may not share your information with members of Democrats Abroad who are unauthorized to process your information and may not share your information for any non-Democrats-Abroad-related purposes.  Certain elected officials at the country level and authorized country-level volunteers are only granted access to process the personal information of members of Democrats Abroad who reside within their country’s jurisdiction, and in some cases, processing is limited to the chapters or precinct level.  For example, if you reside in Germany, your registration information will be accessible to authorized members of Democrats Abroad who reside in Germany, but your information cannot be accessed by members of Democrats Abroad who reside in other countries. Some authorized officials or volunteers at the sub-country level (e.g., the Berlin Chapter), will be able to access your information if you live within the chapter’s designated territory, but they cannot access your information if you live outside the chapter territory, even if you still reside in Germany.
  * Third parties in order to undertake various activities or services on our behalf in supporting the Services. This includes payment processing providers facilitating credit and payment card transactions, website and application support and hosting providers for online services and providers for the delivery of promotional, digital advertising or other communications, such as MailChimp.
  * We may use the information that you provide if we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with (and/or where we believe we are under a duty to comply with) any legal obligation; or to enforce the relevant terms of service and any other agreement; or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations such as credit agencies, law enforcement or government bodies or the courts in connection with a criminal investigation, suspected illegal activity, fraud prevention and detection, or in legal proceedings.



We do not control information which is sent from your browser to third parties, including social media platforms, analytics companies and advertising networks that receive information in the normal course of your online activities.

Personal information may be transferred to other countries where Democrats Abroad or its service providers maintain operations. These countries may not have equivalent data protection laws to the country from where you access the Services or, in the case of transfers subject to European law, may not be subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission (EC).   An adequacy decision is a decision taken by the EC establishing that a third country provides a comparable level of protection of personal data to that in the EU, through its domestic law or its international commitments.

Where Democrats Abroad transfers personal information it will seek to take account of any applicable legal obligations relevant to personal information transfers.  In the case of transfers of personal information out of the European Economic Area,  it will, in the absence of an EC adequacy decision relevant to the destination country, seek to rely on appropriate safeguards such as a valid Privacy Shield certification (in the case of a data transfer to a Privacy Shield certified US recipient -  <https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome>) or enter into appropriate EC approved standard contractual clauses relevant to personal data transfers between data controllers or between a data controller and a data processor, (see <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm>).

### 5.Security and data retention

Your privacy is important to us and we place great importance on the steps we take, including technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.

Where you have chosen a password which allows you to access any of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone. We will not be liable for any unauthorized transactions entered into using your username, personal information and/or password.

Your personal information will be retained by us for the duration of your use or access to our Services and may be retained for a period after this time as necessary and relevant to our legitimate operations, our terms with you and in accordance with applicable laws and obligations. This may include retention necessary to meet our tax or Federal Election Commission (United States) reporting requirements as well as time required to enforce any obligations in our agreements, or to identify, issue or resolve legal proceedings.

We may retain a record of your stated objection to the processing of your data, including in respect of an objection to receiving communications from Democrats Abroad for the sole purpose of ensuring that we can continue to respect your wishes to not contact you further, during the term of your objection.

We will take appropriate steps to seek to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information at the point this information is no longer needed by us for our business or legal purposes.

For more information about exercising your rights with respect to our data processing activities, or if you no longer wish to use our Service, see details below about your choices and rights.

### 6.Your choices and rights

You have options and choices over how we use your personal information. You may be required to register or sign in to use or access some of our Services and may need to provide personal information to create a user profile which is associated with your use of our Services. If you wish to amend the personal information that you use to access our Services, you can do so by logging into your account at [www.democratsabroad.org](http://www.democratsabroad.org/) or by contact us using the details in section 8 below.

If you sign up to receive communications from us, you will be asked to confirm your communication preferences and given the opportunity to unsubscribe at any time.

You can contact us directly with requests to correct, erase, restrict, object to, or move your personal information. If you do not want us to process and/or access your personal information, you may be unable to use some of our Services.

You have options and choices over how we use your information. We provide you with tools to access and update specific information relating to your use of the Services at any time. If you sign in to access certain Services, you can update and amend your key contact information directly.

We respect the rights you may have under applicable law to request access to your personal information and where applicable, to request to receive that information in a commonly used electronic format (or ask for this information to be provided in that format to a third party where feasible). You may also have the right under applicable law to request the correction or erasure of your personal information, to seek to object to the further processing under certain circumstances of your information or to request that the processing of specific information about you is restricted while we verify or investigate your concerns about this information.

If you remain unhappy with a response you receive, you can also refer the matter to your data protection supervisory authority. If you reside in the European Union, see <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm>)

### 7.Children’s information

In principle, members of Democrats Abroad must be of voting age in the United States, which means that they are over the age of 18.   However, any United States citizen may join Democrats Abroad if he or she will be 18 or older on the date of the next federal election. Because federal elections occur every two years, it is possible for a 16-year-old to join Democrats Abroad. 

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to Democrats Abroad. For that reason, Democrats Abroad does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information or non-personally identifiable information from users under 16 years of age, other than as permitted by law in support of our internal operations.

If Democrats Abroad learns that personal information of users under the age of 16 has been collected, other than for support of the internal operations, Democrats Abroad will take reasonable steps to remove such information. If you believe that we may have unintentionally collected personal information about your child who is under 16 years of age, you may contact us using the details provided below.
