## What information do we collect about you and how do we collect it? 

We collect certain types of information from and about users of our Website, including information: 

  * by which you may be personally identified, such as name, postal address, e-mail address, or telephone number (“personal information”) 

  * that is about you but individually does not identify you, such as your internet protocol (IP) address and geolocation information; and 

  * about your internet connection, the equipment, operating system, and browser that you use to access the Website and usage details 




We collect this information: 

  * Directly from you when you provide it to us 

  * Automatically as you navigate through the Website. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies 




### Information You Provide to Us.

The information we collect on or through our Website may include: 

  * Information that you provide by filling in forms on our Website. This includes information provided at the time you submit a contact or information request form, register to attend a training session, or subscribe to our e-mail newsletters. We may also ask you for information if you report a problem with our Website 



  * Records and copies of your correspondence (including e-mail addresses), if you contact us 

  * Details of transactions you carry out through our Website and of the fulfillment of your orders, such as when you register to attend a training session hosted by us 




### Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies.

As you navigate through and interact with our Website, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including: 

  * Details of your visits to our Website, including traffic data, geolocation data, logs, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Website 

  * Information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, and browser type 




We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking).  

The information we collect automatically is statistical data and may include personal information, or we may maintain it or associate it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. This information helps us to improve our Website and to deliver better and more personalized services by enabling us to: 

  * Estimate our audience size and usage patterns, such as how often you visit, where you go on the site and what you do 

  * Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Website according to your individual interests 

  * Speed up your searches

The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include Cookies and other tracking. See our [Cookie Policy](https://www.bounteous.com/legal/cookie-policy/) for details.

## Connecting To Google Applications 

Bounteous hosts several tools and calculators on [www.bounteous.com](http://www.bounteous.com/) that provide the ability for visitors to connect to certain Google products, like Google Analytics. Different Bounteous tools may ask for different permissions, so it is important to review the requested permissions before allowing access. 

### How It Works 

In order for these Bounteous applications to work properly, a user must begin the process by clicking the ‘Connect’ button. The user will be taken to a secure page on Google.com via a new window or tab, where the permissions the tool requires will be displayed. If the user consents to grant Bounteous' permission, Google will issue a token that our tools can use to access the requested information. 

For these tools and calculators, Bounteous only requests temporary access to a user’s Google application. After receiving permission, Bounteous can, within the scope of the approved access, request information about, or data from, any account the user has access to. By default, our access to a user’s information expires after one hour. 

By default, our tools are able to see the email address of the of the user's account, if the user opts to use our tools and provides authentication. We do not capture or store this information on our servers. Our tools do not ever see or store a user’s password, as that is entered on a secure window or tab on Google’s website and is not visible to us. 

As no information is stored by default, no Bounteous employee or other individual has access to user email addresses or the results of the tools, including the data received from Google, unless the user explicitly opts-in to sharing results via email or signing up for email newsletters. 

We do not request the ability to extend the lifetime of the token (termed ‘Offline Access’). We do not store or receive the token on our server anywhere; the token itself is only accessible by the user’s browser. 

To monitor which tools from Bounteous, and others, have been granted access to your information, and to see which permissions have been granted, review your connected applications here: <https://myaccount.google.com/permissions>. 

### How Do We Use The Information? 

The information that we request is used by our tools in calculations and visualizations about your selected data. Again, we do not store your information by default; however, depending on the tool, we may ask if you would like to share or email the results of your information. If offered, this step is voluntary but may allow us to receive a copy of your information so that we may provide recommendations, analysis, or follow-up support regarding your use of the tool or your individual results. If you share your results with others via email, or specifically ask for Bounteous to follow-up, we may follow up infrequently to offer support, answer questions, or offer services. 

## Customer Email Lists 

Bounteous maintains several email newsletters to help communicate information about our recent blog posts, upcoming trainings, and other general informational and marketing purposes. You can opt-out of these electronic communications at any time by following the instructions in our emails. 

When you register for blog updates, we will send you content related to your choices. At any time, you may update your subscription settings to change the frequency or types of emails, or opt-out completely of these electronic communications by following the instructions in our emails or by emailing [bnt-privacy@bounteous.com](mailto:bnt-privacy@bounteous.com).
