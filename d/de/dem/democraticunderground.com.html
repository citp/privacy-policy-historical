      <p>Democratic Underground, LLC  (“Democratic Underground” or “the Site”) has created this  privacy statement in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to  privacy. In adopting this privacy policy, the intent is to balance  the Site’s legitimate business interests in collecting and using  personally identifiable information and a user’s reasonable  expectations of privacy. The following discloses the information  gathering and dissemination practices for the Democratic Underground  Site.</p>
      <p><strong>Information Collection &amp; Use</strong></p>
      <p><u>Information  Collected from All Users</u></p>
      <p>Democratic Underground collects  certain information from users that is not personally identifiable.  This information includes, but is not limited to, the user’s  Internet service provider (ISP), Internet protocol (IP) address,  Internet browser type and version and operating system (OS). Other  information collected includes the date and time of a user’s exit  and entry on the Site, the names and addresses of referral sites, the  specific pages a user chooses to visit on the Site and certain search  terms that a user may have employed to find the Site.</p>
      <p><u>Use of Information  Collected from All Users</u></p>
      <p>Information collected from “All  Users” is used for purposes of internal reviews, including, but not  limited to, traffic audits, tailoring of pages to a particular user’s  technology environment, analyzing traffic and search trends,  generating aggregate demographic information and general Site  administration. This information may be shared in an aggregate form  with advertisers and other third parties with a legitimate interest  in the data. This aggregated data is anonymous and does not allow  third parties to identify Democratic Underground users.</p>
      <p><u>Information Collected from  Registered Users</u></p>
      <p>“Registered Users” are users  that choose to participate more fully on the Democratic Underground  Site. This higher level of participation includes, but is not limited  to, a user’s decision to register for the online forums, make a  purchase or donation, or otherwise share more detailed personal or  payment information with Democratic Underground.</p>
      <p>Democratic Underground registration  and payment forms may require users to provide certain types of personally identifiable  information. This information may include, but is not limited to, a  user’s name, e-mail address, postal address, country of residence,  telephone number, year of birth, gender and similar identifying  information. This information may also include payment information,  such as a user’s credit card number or other payment account  numbers. Democratic Underground may also record a  user’s IP address along with your personally identifiable  information.</p>
      <p><u>Use of Information Collected from  Registered Users</u></p>
      <p>Information collected from  “Registered Users” is used for purposes of communicating with  registered users, including, but not limited to, sending a user  occasional e-mail messages from Democratic Underground, corresponding  with users via email in response to user inquiries, providing  services a user may request and otherwise managing a user’s  account. Users’ contact information may be shared with other  organizations and companies, pre-screened by Democratic Underground,  who may want to contact Site users. Users may opt-out of future  mailings from Democratic Underground by employing methods provided in  the below section entitled “Opt-Out and Modification of Provided  Information.”</p>
      <p>Payment information is used for  purposes of billing and order fulfillment. This includes, but is not  limited to, sending a user’s billing information to a credit card  processor or providing a user’s postal address to a shipping  company.</p>
      <p>IP addresses and e-mail addresses may  be employed by the Site for identity, safety and security purposes.  Such uses include, but are not limited to, identifying specific users  in the discussion forums or preventing access to the Site based on a  user’s IP or e-mail address. Democratic Underground reserves the  right to retain records of IP or e-mail addresses obtained by a  Registered User for purposes of User identification and enforcement  of Site policies and procedures.</p>
      <p>Democratic Underground authorizes  pre-screened volunteer moderators to access limited information about  Registered Users. Information accessible by these volunteers  generally includes e-mail address, history of activity on the Site,  and a user’s deleted posts, warnings, suspensions, and related  discipline information. Volunteers also have access to any personal  information which a Registered User may voluntarily disclose,  including a user’s real name and location. Volunteer moderators do  not have access to a user’s donation information or IP address.</p>
      <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
      <p>Democratic Underground employs  reasonable security methods to secure users’ privacy, including,  but not limited to, third-party encryption of payment forms, password  protected file systems and similar means of protection, designed to  protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under  Democratic Underground’s control. While Democratic Underground  takes commercially reasonable security precautions, the Site is not  responsible for data breaches of third parties, such as payment  processors, web hosts or advertising providers.</p>
      <p><strong>Voluntary Public Disclosure</strong></p>
      <p>The Democratic Underground Site may  include features, such as discussion forums, blog comment forms and  related tools, that allow users to publicly share information about  themselves. Any information a user discloses in these areas is  publicly available on the Internet. Such information may be read,  archived, collected, or used by other Internet users, including  automated services such as search engines. Democratic Underground is  not responsible for personally identifiable information you choose to  publicly disclose, and urges users to exercise caution when  disclosing information that may be personal in nature.<br>
