## Privacy Policy

Our e-mail list is opt-in: to get on our e-mail list, you must take the action of [joining our community](https://web.archive.org/user/register), [subscribing to our mailings](http://archive.democrats.com/popup.cfm), or [signing our petitions](http://democrats.com/organize). If someone adds your e-mail address to our list without your permission, we apologize. 

You can unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions at the bottom of every mailing. If the link does not work for any reason, [contact us](http://democrats.com/contact) and we will remove you promptly. 

We do not sell e-mail addresses to spammers, and no one can search our site for e-mail addresses unless you choose to post it in your Democrats.community messages or public profile, which we discourage.

We collect Democrats.community membership information to screen membership requests and make sure our members are Democrats. You control this information through your membership account page. You can leave the community at any time. When you log in to the community, we place a cookie so you can view private sections of the community that are only available to members.

We encourage Democrats.community members to connect with each other. If you choose, you can publish as much personal information as you like in our Membership Directory, which is only viewable by other Democrats.community members.

We collect petition signatures to allow members to express their views on important topics. We do not display e-mail addresses to protect your privacy, but we use the address to keep you informed about the progress of the petition and other activist efforts by Democrats.com. Once again, you can unsubscribe from our Activist list by following the instructions at the bottom of every e-mail.

We process online contributions and payments both for Democrats.com and for approved Democratic candidates, committees, and causes. You will receive an immediate confirmation by e-mail with our client's name in the description. All such payments will read "Democrats.com" on your credit card bill, even if the funds go to our client. We use secure SSL technology to protect your sensitive information. We do not store your credit card number in order to avoid fraud.

We occasionally send advertising e-mails from approved Democratic candidates and committees, and progressive causes. You may unsubscribe from this advertising list at any time without affecting your newsletter subscription or community membership by following the instructions at the bottom of each e-mail. If you respond to our partner ads by contributing or subscribing or signing a petition, we will forward the information you provide to our partner. All of our partners must have a privacy policy similar to ours.

If we make significant changes to our privacy policy, we will notify you by e-mail and give you the opportunity to unsubscribe from our e-mail list.

If you change your e-mail address, please unsubscribe from the mailings you are now receiving from us at your old address (by following the instructions at the bottom of each mailing), and [resubscribe with your new address](http://archive.democrats.com/popup.cfm).

Finally, we use anonymous aggregate statistics to help us improve our site.
