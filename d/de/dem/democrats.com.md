# Our Privacy Policy

Democrats.com is strongly committed to privacy. We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information or share it with any third party, except for programming contractors.

We collect subscription information only for purposes of fulfilling subscription requests. You can unsubscribe at any time. When you subscribe, we place a permanent cookie on your computer so you will not be asked to subscribe again.

We collect community membership information only for purposes of screening membership requests, to make sure our members are Democrats. You control this information through your membership account page. You can leave the community at any time. When you log in to the community, we place a session-only cookie so you can view private sections of the community that are only available to members.

We encourage community members to connect with each other. If you choose, you can publish as much personal information as you like in our Membership Directory, which is only viewable by other community members. You can also publish personal information on your personal home page, which is viewable by the public.

We occasionally send advertising e-mails from approved Democratic candidates, committees, and causes. You may unsubscribe from this advertising list at any time without affecting your newsletter subscription or community membership.

We use anonymous aggregate statistics to help us improve our site. 

If we sell the company (we don't plan to, but just in case!), we will ask your permission to continue receiving e-mail from the new owners.
