		    <p>At Demandware, we respect the privacy of our customers and the visitors to our   										website. This statement describes the current information gathering, sharing   										and privacy practices for our website, www.demandware.com. </p>
			<h4>Collection of Personal Information</h4>
			<p>We will ask you when we need information that identifies you individually or   										allows us to contact you directly (personal information). 
			</p>
			<p>We may ask for personal information when you purchase a product, enter a   										contest, request a service, complete a survey, subscribe to a news, or engage   										in some other activity on our site. In connection with these activities, we may   										ask you for contact information such as your name, telephone number, and email   										address. </p>
			<p>When you visit our website, we collect standard information about your hardware   										and software such as your IP addresses, browser type, operating system, pages   										visited on our site, referring and exit pages, and the dates and times of the   										visits. </p>
			<p>This site visitation data is used to administer the site and provide general   										statistics regarding the use of demandware.com. Site visitation data is never   										linked to your personal information, and we do not use it to identify you   										individually without your permission. </p>
		
			<h4>Use of Personal Information</h4>
			<p>We will keep any and all information collected from you at this site strictly   										confidential and we will not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your   										personal information with third parties for their promotional use without your   										permission. 
			</p>
			<p>We will use the personal information you give us to fulfill the services and   										provide the products you request from us. This may include sending information   										that you have requested, or contacting you about products and services that you   										have purchased. If you do not opt-out of communications from Demandware, we may   										send you marketing notices including promotions of our products and services.   										You can opt-out of communications from Demandware at any time (see "Control of   										Personal Information" below). </p>
			<p>We sometimes contract with other companies to provide services such as packaging   										and mailing information, answering user questions, or processing credit card   										transactions. We will only provide these partners with the information they   										need to conduct their services, they will be prohibited from using the   										information we provide for any other purpose and we will require them to   										observe the intent of this Privacy Policy. </p>
			<p>We may disclose your personal information when we reasonably believe that it is   										required by a law or legal process and to protect and defend our rights and   										interests and the rights and interests of our affiliates, suppliers, or users.   										We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities   										that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release certain personal   										information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to   										enforce or apply these terms and conditions or to protect the rights, property,   										and safety of others and ourselves. </p>
		
			<p>In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, an   										acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of our assets,   										users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets   										transferred. Notifications of such a transition will be made using the   										mechanisms described in the "Changes to this Statement" section below. </p>
			<h4>Control of Personal Information</h4>
			<p>You can confirm, change, or update personal information you have provided to us   										by contacting us directly at privacy@demandware.com with your request. 
			</p>
			<p>If you want to opt-out of communications from the company, you can do so by   										emailing your request to privacy@demandware.com. If you change your mind, you   										can opt-in again, by emailing this same address. When you opt-out of   										promotional communications from us, you may still receive service messages   										(such as an order confirmation), legally mandated notices, and critical   										messages that relate to the ability to use services you have purchased from us. </p>
			<h4>Security of the Information We Collect</h4>
		
			<p>We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information, and we   										use a range of technologies and procedures to protect your personal   										information. For example, we store personal information in a secure, limited   										access facility; sensitive information transmitted to us through our store   										(such as a credit card number) is encrypted for transmission using the Secure   										Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. The SSL encryption is designed to make the   										information unreadable by anyone but us.    </p>
			<h4>Protection of Children's Privacy</h4>
			<p>demandware.com is a general interest website, and we do not knowingly collect   										any personal information from children. </p>
			<h4>Privacy and Online Forums</h4>
			<p>Information you post in online forums on the site is accessible to other people   										who can access the forums and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.   										We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose   										to submit in these forums. Personal information stored in your forum profile   										will not be displayed in the forum. </p>
			<h4>Privacy and Tell-a-Friend Forms</h4>
		
			<p>When you use a tell-a-friend form on the site, we ask for the friend's name and   										email address. We will use this information to automatically send the specified   										email message to the friend. We will not use this information to contact the   										friend in the future. We will retain the information you provide for tracking   										purposes. If someone notified through tell a friend wishes to have their   										information removed from our database they can contact us at   										privacy@demandware.com. </p>
			<h4>Use of Cookies and Clear gif Technology</h4>
			<p>When you visit our site, a cookie may be saved on your computer (if your   										computer accepts cookies), and if you return to the site the cookie may be   										read. We use cookies to help us collect the site visitation data described   										above and in some cases to deliver specialized content. A cookie is a small   										data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them.   										A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to   										track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can   										contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your   										hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of our   										website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to   										determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how   										effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that   										information. We do not correlate this information with data about individual   										users, nor do we share this information or sell it to any third party. </p>
			<p>If you prefer not to receive cookies on our website, you can set your browser to   										warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser   										alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off   										in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any area of   										our website. </p>
			<p>We may also use Web beacons, clear gif technology, or action tags as mechanisms   										to collect aggregate site visitation data by tracking how users navigate to and   										through our website. We may also use this technology to track the delivery of   										HTML email messages. This data is collected exclusively for use in our   										marketing and research. </p>
			<h4>Enforcement of this Statement</h4>
		
			<p>If you have questions about the policies described in this statement, please   										email us directly at privacy@demandware.com. </p>
			<h4>Links to Other Websites</h4>
			<p>Our website may contain links to other websites. If you use these links, you   										will leave our website. When you access a non-demandware.com website, even one   										that may contain the Demandware logo, please be aware that we do not control   										the content and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that site   										and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of each site you use. This   										Privacy Statement does not cover the information practices of those websites   										linked to our website. These other sites may send their own cookies to users,   										collect data, or solicit personal information. </p>
			<h4>Changes to this Statement</h4>
			<p>We may from time to time update this privacy statement. When we make these   										updates, we will change the "last updated" date listed at the top of the   										statement. If we make a material change to this statement that affects our use   										of your personal information, we will update users by placing a more prominent   										notice on our home page. </p>
		
			<h4>Contact Information</h4>
			<p>We welcome your input on our privacy policy. If you have any questions or   										suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@demandware.com"> privacy@demandware.com</a>. </p>
