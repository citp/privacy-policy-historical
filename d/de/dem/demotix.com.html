<h3>Notification of changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<div>
<p>We are continually improving our methods

advice, or services from us. We may request personal information about you such as your name, postal address, email address, telephone numbers
and we may ask for information which enables us to provide a personalised service to you. The information you give us is either manually or

<h3>Anonymous data collected through this website</h3>
<div>
<p>In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our website. For example, we use technology to track which pages of our website our visitors view. We also use technology to determine which Web browsers our visitors use.

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<div>
<p>In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, we may use temporary “cookies” that remain in the cookies file of your browser until the browser is closed.

Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not.  We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as determining how many of our visitors are from outside of the UK.  We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (i.e: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics.</p>
