#### Who we are

Dentons is a global legal practice providing client services worldwide through member firms and affiliates, each of which is its own legal practice. Dentons Group (a Swiss Verein) does not itself provide legal or other client services.

The terms "Dentons" and ''the firm" mean one or more Legal Practices ("we"/"us"/"our").  Any reference to "partner" means the partner, member, consultant or employee with equivalent standing and qualifications in at least one Legal Practice.

Any reference to a Dentons "location" means any office, associate office, facility, associate firm, or entity with a special alliance with our international legal practice.

Personal data is collected by each member of the Dentons Group. In the European Union our primary data collectors are Dentons UK and Middle East LLP (a UK limited liability partnership with registration number OC322045) and Dentons Europe LLP (a UK limited liability partnership with registration number OC316822) and their affiliates. See the list of Dentons entities and locations worldwide [here](https://www.dentons.com/en/legal-notices).
