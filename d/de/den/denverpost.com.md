Privacy Policy

The Denver Post Corp. is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers. The following statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the denverpost.com Web site.

**

What personally identifiable information does DenverPost.com collect from me?

**

DenverPost.com collects information in several ways. Some information is gathered through server log files and from code embedded in DenverPost.com pages that records the browser preferences and settings of readers' computers. Various types of personal information are gathered when you enter a contest or promotion, sign up for a discussion group, request vacation delivery stop, or when you post an online ad. During these instances, DenverPost.com asks for information such as your name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, phone number, subscriber status, and credit card number. We may also ask you for other information at other times. Whenever we collect information about you, we will make an effort to link to our privacy policy.

**

How is my information used?

**

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a customized experience. DenverPost.com uses information collected from server log files, such as IP addresses, to help diagnose problems with our services, to administer our Web site, and to report and gather aggregate information about site usage and user demographics. DenverPost.com also uses code included on every page on our site to track the traffic on pages and compile information about users, such as paths through the site, browsers used, time spent on site, frequency of return visits, etc. This system does not garner any personal information about our readers, such as names. DenverPost.com may share aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.

DenverPost.com also uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web service and stored on your computer's hard drive. DenverPost.com uses cookies to deliver targeted advertising based on your behavior or demographics and to track your number of entries in some of our promotions and contests. You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do, we will not be able to customize the DenverPost.com Web site's features according to your preferences. Advertising networks that serve ads into our site, such as Real Media or DoubleClick, may also use their own cookies. For more information about Real Media's use of cookies, visit _http://www.realmedia.com/privacy.html._ For more information about DoubleClick's use of cookies, visit _http://www. privacychoices.org_.

**

With whom is my information shared?

**

When you are on an area of DenverPost.com and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with The Denver Post Corp. and its related companies. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any other company, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.

Promotions and contests that run on DenverPost.com may be sponsored by companies other than DenverPost.com or may be co-sponsored by DenverPost.com and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion or contest may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion or contest if you don't want your data to be shared.

DenverPost.com makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to our users. Some of these forums require registration. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

Aggregate information compiled by DenverPost.com may be shared with advertisers and business partners as well as used by The Denver Post Corp. and its related companies. 

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law or pursuant to a legal proceeding, including without limitation, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request. ****

**Linked Sites**

 ****

Please be aware that DenverPost.com's promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, third-party Internet sites, and content providers accessible through DenverPost.com may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. DenverPost.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. Users should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information through co-sponsored, affiliated or linked sites.

Children's Guidelines

**

The Newspaper in Education program is a free service for teachers that promotes the use of newspapers in the classroom. The Colorado Kids section is specifically directed at students in grades 6 to 12. Within the Colorado Kids section, the Help Wanted, Back Talk and Joke pages allow students to send questions, comments, stories, jokes, ideas and opinions to DenverPost.com via email. The information requested on these pages is used solely for participation in the particular activity, and is not stored or sold to third parties. If a question, comment, story, joke, idea or opinion is published, only the student's first name, grade and state/country appear on the site. Students are advised to consult with their parents before giving personal information online.

**
