Condé Nast shall take reasonable steps to ensure that any transfer of your personal information to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area, whose laws may provide for a lesser standard of protection for your personal information than that provided under European law, shall have adequate protection (such as model contractual arrangements as approved by the EU).

### Condé Nast Cookies

  * 8.1. "Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you.

    * Persistent cookies. These cookies stay on your computer until they expire or are deleted. We set automatic deletion dates so that we don't keep your information for longer than we need to.
  * 8.5. Our Websites also use cookies, for example, to: 
    * Gather customer journey information across our sites and fulfil any of your requests;
    * Gain insight into the nature of our audience so we can tailor our content accordingly;
    * Ensure your privacy when you visit our secure sites;
    * Store login details for our secure sites;
    * Store details of your marketing preferences to improve and enhance your visit to our sites;
    * Evaluate our sites' advertising and promotional effectiveness - all information is anonymised and we don't share it with anyone;
    * Provide advertising on our sites and on other sites which are tailored to your interests and preferences;
    * Remember settings you have applied to a Website such as layout, font size, preferences, colours etc;
    * Detect if a service has already been offered to you so that we don't ask you again.
