appreciate that you do not want any personal information you
provide to us distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how
we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you
have. This privacy policy may change from time to time so please
check back here frequently.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What personal information do we collect from you?</p>

<p>1.1&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
personal information?&nbsp; Personal information is any information
that allows someone to identify you, including, for example, your
name, address, telephone and mobile numbers, email address, as well
as any information about you that is associated with or linked to,
or could be linked to, any of the foregoing data.</p>

<p>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your
personal information is collected when you register or fill in a
form on a Website, contact Condé Nast, or complete a form in any of
our publications which may relate, for example, to subscriptions,
competitions, offers and promotions. This includes information you
provide when you register to use our Website, subscribe to
newsletters, place an order or participate in discussion boards on
our Website.&nbsp; The information you give us may include your
name, address, email, phone number and payment details.</p>

<p>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Personal information that is provided by you will only be used for
the purpose for which it is provided, unless you are informed
otherwise at the time of giving the information.</p>

<p>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condé
Nast will from time to time collect information from you for the
purpose of creating de-personalised data that does not reveal your
identity.&nbsp; Condé Nast uses this information to improve our
products and occasionally for other internal purposes.&nbsp; This
information is only used in de-personalised form and is not
connected to any name, address or other personal identifying
information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How is your information processed, stored and kept secure?</p>

<p>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your
personal information may be processed both in and outside the
UK.&nbsp; When you submit your details in whichever country you are
situated you agree to the information being processed in the
UK.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may
also process or transfer your personal information outside the UK
(and possibly to places outside the European Economic Area, which
is all EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and
Liechtenstein).&nbsp; Condé Nast shall take reasonable steps to
ensure that any transfer of your personal information to a country
or territory outside the European Economic Area, whose laws may
provide for a lesser standard of protection for your personal
information than that provided under European law, shall have
adequate protection (such as model contractual arrangements as
approved by the EU).</p>

<p>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Websites and our servers, wherever they are based, have appropriate
technical and organisational measures in place to protect against
unauthorised or unlawful use of your personal information as well
as the accidental loss, destruction or damage of your personal
information whilst under our control. &nbsp;</p>

<p>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to
be 100% secure and whilst we strive to protect your personal
information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information
you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How do we use your personal information?</p>

<p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condé
Nast processes personal information for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>providing you with goods and/or services that you have
requested and communicating with you about those products and
services;</li>

<li>monitoring, developing and improving the Websites, our services
and your experience;</li>

<li>providing a personalised service;</li>

<li>conducting market research surveys;</li>

<li>running competitions;</li>

<li>providing you with information about Condé Nast's,&nbsp; or our
business partners' products and services where you have provided
your consent.&nbsp; You will always be able to opt-out or
unsubscribe from these messages;</li>

<li>send out email alerts you have agreed to receive.&nbsp; You
will always be able to unsubscribe from these messages;</li>

<li>processing and dealing with any complaints or enquiries made by
you or legally on your behalf;</li>

<li>we may also be required to disclose your personal information
to authorities who can request this information by law that is
binding on Condé Nast, for instance for the prevention and
detection of crime, the capture or prosecution of offenders and the
assessment or collection of taxes; and</li>

<li>other purposes related to any of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condé
Nast may also contact you about your registration details, to
manage any account or subscription you have with us, or to provide
customer service, even if you have opted-out of or declined to
consent to receiving promotional emails. &nbsp;We may also contact
you if we consider that revisions to this privacy policy are
sufficiently important to notify you about them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do we share your personal information with anyone else?</p>

<p>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may
share your personal information with any member of our group, which
means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its
subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act
2006.</p>

<p>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may
disclose your personal information to partners of Condé Nast who
supply services to you on behalf of Condé Nast and who need to
process personal information in the provision of such
services.&nbsp; When you request goods and services from Condé
Nast, you are consenting to the disclosure of your personal
information to Condé Nast's partners who may provide such goods and
services under contract and guarantee to our satisfaction that they
have sufficiently robust processes in place to ensure the security
of your personal information whilst it is in their care.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may
disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>

<p>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in
which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective
seller or buyer of such business or assets.</p>

<p>If all or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a
third party, in which case personal data held by us about our
customers will be one of the transferred assets.</p>

<p>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may
disclose depersonalised data (such as aggregated statistics) about
the users of our Websites in order to describe our sales,
customers, traffic patterns and other site information to
prospective partners, advertisers, investors and other reputable
third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics
will include no personally identifying information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under
certain circumstances we may occasionally be required by law, court
order or governmental authority to disclose certain types of
personal information and we reserve the right to comply with any
such legally binding request.&nbsp; Examples of the type of
situation where this would occur would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the administration of justice;</li>

<li>where we have to defend ourselves legally;</li>

<li>in complying with the mandatory requirements of a government
department collecting information; and</li>

<li>to protect or defend the rights or property of Condé Nast
Publications Ltd or users of our services.</li>
</ul>

<p>4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other
than this, Condé Nast will not disclose any of your personal
information to any other third parties without your consent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Are there any age restrictions on supplying personal information to
us?</p>

<p>If you are aged [16] or under, please get your parent/guardian's
permission beforehand whenever you provide personal information to
the Websites. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide
us with personal information. If we become aware that you are under
[16] and are attempting to or have submitted personal information
via the Websites without your parent/guardian's permission, we will
not accept such information and we will take steps to remove such
information from our records. This may involve us having to access
and verify your age and other relevant details.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How long will we keep your personal information?</p>

<p>We will hold your personal information on our systems only for
as long as is necessary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Changing your mind about receiving marketing messages.</p>

<p>We give you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing
of your personal information.&nbsp; When you register on one of our
sites or respond to one of our communications or offers, we will
ask you to make choices about receiving further marketing
communications from us.&nbsp; Should you wish to stop receiving
marketing communications from us, you will be able to unsubscribe
or opt-out, or you can contact us and we will make the changes for
you.&nbsp; Our contact details are at the end of this privacy
policy.&nbsp; Please remember to include your full name and address
in order that we may make the changes that you request.&nbsp;</p>

How do we use cookies?</p>

<p>Condé Nast Cookies</p>

<p>8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to
your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about
you.&nbsp; Cookies are common and won't do anything to harm your
system - they simply store or gather information.&nbsp; They help
you to get the most out of your visit to our Websites.</p>

<p>8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may
collect information about your computer including, where available,
your IP address, operating system and browser type for system
administration as part of our audit trail process.&nbsp; Most web
browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can
change your browser to prevent that. You are not obliged to accept
cookies and you can adjust your browser's setting to prevent it
from accepting cookies on your computer - go to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>
for instructions on how to disable cookies.&nbsp; However, you may
not be able to take full advantage of our Websites if you do
so.</p>

<p>8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be
accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track
your movements around the web. Although they can be used to store
information which may identify a user's computer, cookies do not
personally identify users and passwords and credit card information
are not stored in cookies.</p>

<p>8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
Websites use two main types of cookies:</p>

<p>Per-session cookies.&nbsp; We only use these whilst you are
visiting our website and they are deleted when you leave.&nbsp;
They remember you as you move between pages, for example recording
the items you add to an online shopping basket.&nbsp; They also
help maintain security.</p>

<p>Persistent cookies.&nbsp; These cookies stay on your computer
until they expire or are deleted.&nbsp; We set automatic deletion
dates so that we don't keep your information for longer than we
need to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
Websites also use cookies, for example, to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gather customer journey information across our sites and fulfil
any of your requests;</li>

<li>Ensure your privacy when you visit our secure sites;</li>

<li>Store login details for our secure sites;</li>

<li>Store details of your marketing preferences to improve and
enhance your visit to our sites;</li>

<li>Evaluate our sites' advertising and promotional effectiveness -
all information is anonymised and we don't share it with
anyone;</li>

<li>Remember settings you have applied to a Website such as layout,
font size, preferences, colours etc;</li>

<li>Detect if a service has already been offered to you so that we
don't ask you again.</li>
</ul>

Social Media.</p>

<p>9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social
networking sites, such as Facebook, among others, work with us as
trusted third party partners. We also work with application
developers who specialise in social media, so that we can connect
with your social networks.&nbsp; We provide access to our Websites
for third parties and business partners so that we can generate
interest in our products and services among members of your social

with friends in your network. &nbsp;</p>

<p>9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do
not control how your personal information is collected, stored or

You should review the privacy policies and settings on any social
networking site that you subscribe to so that you understand the
information they may be sharing.&nbsp; If you do not want your
networking sites to share information about you, you must contact
that site and determine whether it gives you the opportunity to
opt-out of sharing such information.&nbsp; Condé Nast is not
responsible for how these third party sites may use information
collected from or about you.</p>
