However, you decide what information you want to share with the public, since you have the option to post your reviews anonymously, or not post any review at all.

Software providers also benefit from your feedback, since they can improve their products and services, have a better understanding of business needs, and can promote their products and services by making these reviews accessible to different audiences (see How We Share Your Information).
