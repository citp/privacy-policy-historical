                            Protecting your privacy while you visit our site is of utmost importance for us. Please read below what happens with your data while browsing our site.
                            Welcome to our site ("Site"). Geometry Global knows how our clients and visitors like you value your privacy, and we have created this privacy policy to ensure that you understand our policies and procedures, what personally identifiable information you must provide if you wish to use the Site and, ultimately, just how we use such personally identifiable information.
                            This policy applies only to the web site located at www.geometry.com, and not to any other web site or service.  If you do not agree with this policy, then you should not use the Site.

                            Geometry Global may collect and store personally identifiable information about you if you voluntarily submit such information to Geometry Global. Personally identifiable information may include your name, email address, physical address and other information that specifically identifies you.

                            Geometry Global may also automatically collect (through cookies, described below, and other methods) and store aggregate or anonymous information about user contact with and use of the Site.  Examples of this type of information include demographic information, the type of internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system application software and peripherals you are using, the domain name of the web site from which you linked to our Site and your browsing habits on and usage of the Site.  Non-Personally identifiable information may also include personally identifiable information that has been aggregated so that no one individual is specifically identifiable (such as, how many users in a particular city access the Site).

Except for the parties described below, we do not sell or share your personally identifiable information with third parties without your consent. We may share your personally identifiable information with our clients (if they have agreed to comply with privacy protections similar to those set forth in this policy), companies that are affiliates of Geometry Global, technical consultants and other third parties who make our Site available, enhance its functionality, or provide associated services (but only for the purpose of providing such services to Geometry Global).<br>

                            We reserve the right to transfer any information to our successors in business and purchasers of Site assets or a particular division or line of business.
                            We also reserve the right to access and/or disclose any information as required by courts or administrative agencies and to the extent necessary to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, the Site rules or policies, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct which Geometry Global deems improper.

                            We may use cookies and similar technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information from you and to customize your use of the Site. A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. We may also use web bugs, clear gifs and similar technologies that collect data similar to that collected by a cookie.  A cookie file can contain various types of information, including a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited.
                            Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent or you can flush your browser of cookies from time to time. (Note: you may need to consult the help area of your browser application for instructions.) If you choose to disable cookies or refuse to accept a cookie, you may not be able to utilize all features of the Site.
                            At times, some of our advertisers and their ad service providers set cookies when you click their advertising banners. While we use cookies in other parts of the Site (as discussed above), cookies received with banner ads are collected by those advertisers and their ad service providers. The advertiser’s privacy policy and/or that of its service provider will govern the use of this information and Geometry Global is not responsible for the privacy practices of such advertiser or ad service provider.<br>
