# Privacy Policy

**G2PLAY.net respects your privacy and works hard to safeguard the privacy of your personal data.

We want you to know that we apply our long-standing commitment of safeguarding privacy to our online and Internet activities.**

In addition to this general online privacy policy, you may receive notice of other terms that apply to particular promotions or services. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**

G2PLAY.net does not share, disclose or sell any personally-identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) collected online on G2PLAY.net' sites with other unaffiliated companies or organizations for non-G2PLAY.net marketing purposes. Because this information is a critical part of our business, it would be treated like our other assets in the context of a merger, sale or other corporate reorganization or legal proceeding. G2PLAY.net also does not market to, or knowingly collect personal information from, children under he age of 13 on Company sites.

Postal and e-mail address information, for example, enables communication about services offered and ordered, as well as the proper provisioning and billing of those services. 

We also provide personally-identifiable online information in response to subpoenas and other legal demands, and where we believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against individuals who may be endangering public safety or interfering with G2PLAY.net' services, or with our customers' or others' use of them. 

**How We Collect Information**

G2PLAY.net collects information online by asking you for it, for example, when you order a service, apply for a job, or respond to a survey, offer or other promotion. A customer's name, address (postal and e-mail) and telephone number are the most important pieces of information, but we might request other information, based on, for example, the service(s) being ordered or promoted. 

G2PLAY.net may also use "cookies" and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to our sites or your responses to e-mail from us - both individually and in aggregated data that does not identify you.
