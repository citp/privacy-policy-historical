No personal information is collected. Ever. In addition, our web sites track information about the visits to our web sites. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, such as our advertisers, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.

## Reciprocal Links

It is our policy to not link to "link farm" pages. Automated link requests are not accepted or reciprocated. We do not exchange links or entertain link requests of any type.
