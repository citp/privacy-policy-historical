We do not consider personal information to include: business contact information, business information publicly available on the internet or other public sources, information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person, or information that merely identifies a computer or browser, or an ID number assigned to an anonymous person.

### Privacy Shield Certification 

Radial, including members of the Radial corporate family, such as Radial South, L.P., participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.  Radial is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the [U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list).

Radial is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  Radial complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received **** or **** transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Radial is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  In certain situations, Radial may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

### Collection

**Categories of Individual Data Subjects**  
In general, Radial may obtain EU Personal Data in the United States about several different types of individuals, including consumers, Clients (defined below), suppliers and other business partners. Radial's practices with respect to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below.

Consumers  
Radial provides a wide variety of services and solutions to its business clients (each, a "Client") that facilitate services for their customers ("Consumers"). In these cases, personal data collected from Consumers is owned by the applicable Client, and Radial processes this data on the Client's behalf. There may be limited instances in which Radial owns and processes personal data collected from Consumers on its own behalf, rather than on behalf of a Client. In all instances, Radial will obtain access to EU Personal Data about Consumers in the course of operating websites, processing payments, fulfilling orders, implementing marketing campaigns and providing customer care and other related services. Such data may include, name, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, credit card or other payment information, and other information, depending on the particular Client, website or other application at issue. In all instances, Radial will not share, sell, rent, or trade with third parties for promotional purposes any personal data processed by Radial, unless Radial is directed to do so by a Client who owns such personal data.

Clients, Suppliers and Other Business Partners  
Radial may obtain various types of EU Personal Data about employees and agents of its Clients, suppliers and other business partners. Such data may include contact information (e.g. names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and email addresses); user IDs and passwords; information collected through Internet-based and ecommerce activities; and other transaction-related data.  
Radial may use these types of EU Personal Data for business purposes, including to establish and maintain Client, supplier and other business relationships; to deliver or provide products or services; to provide access to Internet-based applications; to perform accounting functions; and to conduct other activities as necessary or appropriate in connection with the establishment, servicing and development of the business relationship.

**Why We Collect Information**  
We (including all members of our corporate family) may collect and use the information collected at our Sites for any internal purpose, and we may provide that information to our business partners and vendors to be used by them in connection with such purposes. For example, we may use this data to monitor our Sites and to collect aggregate data for marketing purposes and for other future uses, or to determine the most appropriate information to send to those who request it.

You may choose voluntarily to give us personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, or other information about yourself.  In addition, we may collect non-personal information automatically as you navigate our sites. This information may include (but may not be limited to): location data, IP address, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our sites (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, device data such as mobile identifiers, carrier network information, the mobile website or mobile app used, and cookie or pixel tag data.

Certain forms on our sites may also request contact and profile information, such as user name, email address, website, phone number, or company information. Completion of these forms is entirely voluntary but may be required in order to request certain services from Radial. Resume submissions on our Sites are used to screen candidates and contact them for interviews.

Radial may also use our sites to periodically survey our clients for purposes of improving the quality of our service and customer satisfaction. Client participation is completely voluntary, and any information we collect from you as part of our surveys will be treated with the same respect as any other information gathered in accordance with this Notice.

**How We Collect It**  
Our Sites use web beacons and other technologies to collect information when you access our websites, and we may store that information in “cookies”.

We only obtain personally identifying information if it is supplied voluntarily. If you have chosen to receive marketing messages from us about our products and services, we may use information from our log files, cookies, or web beacons to help us make those communications more useful or interesting to you. We may periodically track the open-rates and click behavior of our emails and other messages and advertisements to help us identify which portions of our advertisements are most popular and effective with our customers.

**How We Use Cookies and Other Technologies**  
When you access our sites, we and our affiliates, business partners and vendors may place small data files on your computer or other device. We use these data files, commonly known as “Cookies” to help us identify you as a site visitor or Client, customize our content and enhance your site experience. These third parties may also use a technology called “Tags” or “Web Beacons”. Similar in function to Cookies, Web Beacons allow us to understand the movements of visitors to our Sites. The tracking technologies on our Sites do not collect personal information. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer our Sites, to track users' movements around the Sites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  Radial does not provide personal information through the use of web beacons and cookies to these parties.

You should note that although most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, you may be able to change your browser settings to cause your browser to refuse first party or third party cookies or to indicate when a third party cookie is being sent. However, disabling or limiting cookies may cause certain features of this site to not function properly. Check your browser’s “Help” files or other similar resources to learn more about handling cookies on your browser.

**Data Supplementation**  
We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you.  This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you may include address information about you from third party sources, such as the U.S. Postal Service, to verify your address. This information is used for payment processing, fraud prevention and fulfillment services. 

**Do Not Track**  
California law requires us to state how we respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there is currently no industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT, we do not currently respond to DNT signals. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take. 

### Use and Retention 

**Use**  
We use the information we gather to help us improve our services to offer the best user experience possible, to communicate with our Clients, or for other internal purposes and to generally operate the Sites. You agree that we may use your personal information as follows:

  * To create a profile detailing your service preferences so that we can best serve you
  * To save you from having to re-enter your password each time you visit our site
  * To better analyze our site traffic patterns so that we can bolster our Web offering
  * To respond to your questions or to provide you with the information you have requested



Any non-personally identifiable material, information, suggestions, ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, questions, comments, or other communication you transmit or post to our Sites in any manner will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary "User Communications." Radial and each of our affiliates and/or their designees may use any or all User Communications for any purpose whatsoever, including, without limitation, reproduction, transmission, disclosure, publication, broadcast, development, manufacturing and/or marketing in any manner whatsoever for any or all commercial or non-commercial purposes.
