**1.** **INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON OUR SITES**

**

Information You Provide To Us 

The Sites may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as first and last name, e-mail address, telephone number or credit card information) (“ **Personal Information** ”).  Personal Information does not include corporate information, which relates to an organization but not to an individual (such as a corporate name, corporate address or general corporate phone number). In addition to Personal Information and corporate information, we may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (zip code, preferences, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests. If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with your Personal Information we collect, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

Note that the Sites are directed to a general audience.  Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children younger than the age of thirteen (13) and we will delete any Personal Information collected that we later determine to be from a user younger than the age of thirteen (13).

Please note that information submitted to the Sites via a “contact us” or other similar function may not receive a response.  We will not use the information you provide us via the “contact us” tool to contact you for unrelated marketing purposes unless we disclose otherwise. 

Information We Collect Automatically As You Access and Use the Sites

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, whenever you visit or interact with the Sites or GS1 US content, GS1 US, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect information about how the Sites and content are accessed and used (“ **Usage Information** ”). 

Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, the URL that referred you to our Sites, all the areas or content within our Sites that you visited (including during prior visits to our Sites), operating system, the page served, the time of day, and the preceding page views, among other information. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if GS1 US associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, GS1 US treats it as Personal Information.  GS1 US also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier (“ **Device Identifier** ”) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “ **Device** ”) you use to access the Sites.  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the Sites.  A few of the methods and technologies that may be used on the Sites to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods hereafter developed): 

**_Cookies_**.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites.  A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-into or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Sites may not function properly. 

**_Web Beacons_**.  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons, (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Sites and e-mail messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to determine whether content sent was actually viewed. 

**_Embedded Scripts_**.  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. 

**2.  HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH OUR SITES**

GS1 US may use information collected through our Sites, including Personal Information, in order to: (1) allow you to participate in features we offer; (2) process a transaction you initiate such as to send you newsletters or provide you with promotional materials on our behalf; (3) process your registration or maintain your account, including, at times, verifying that the information you provide is active and valid; (4) provide you with information, products or services that you have requested or agreed to receive and provide our affiliates and member organizations with information relating thereto; (5) tailor content, advertisements, marketing materials and offers we display or send/serve to you; (6) improve the Sites, our products and our services; (7) facilitate your job search via the Sites and prepare related governmental and internal statistics reports; (8) contact you with regard to your use of the Sites, your account, and, in our discretion, changes to any  GS1US  policy; (9) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information or otherwise with your consent; and (10) for internal business purposes. 

If you use the Sites to send a friend an invitation to participate in the Sites or send other GS1 US-related communications, the information you provide (typically, names and e-mail addresses) is used to facilitate the communication on your behalf, and is not subsequently used for marketing purposes unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Sites, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.

**3.  WITH WHOM WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION **

GS1 US does not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes without giving you the opportunity to consent.  However, we may share certain information, including Personal Information and corporate information with GS1 US affiliates and member companies for use by them for their direct marketing purposes, subject to your right to opt-out in Section 7 below. In addition, we may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information, and Usage Information with third parties. 

We may also share your information, including, Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information, as set forth in this Privacy Policy and in the following circumstances: 

**Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf**.  We may from time to time employ third parties to perform services on our behalf, such as hosting our Sites, designing and/or operating the Site’s features, sending e-mails and other communications, fulfilling and processing orders for products or services, assisting with promotions, conferences, tracking analytics, or performing other administrative services.  We may share Personal Information with such third parties in order for them to complete a requested transaction or otherwise perform services for you or for GS1 US. 

**When You Agree to Have Your Personal Information Shared**.  There may be times on our Sites when we give you the chance to opt-in or opt-out of receiving information and/or marketing offers from another party or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party.  If you agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to the third party and the Personal Information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of that third party. Therefore, you should review the privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to agreeing to receive such information from them.  If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communication from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.

**Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions**.  We may offer sweepstakes, contests and other promotions (each, a “ **Promotion** ”) through the Site or elsewhere that may require registration. If you choose to enter or otherwise participate in a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with the administration of such Promotion, such as in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list.  By entering a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials. 

**Business Transfers**.  We may share your information and data, including, without limitation, Personal Information and corporate information with other entities affiliated with us for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes.  GS1 US or any of its assets, including the Sites, may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your Personal Information is one of the business assets for the transaction.  In such a case, your Personal Information may be one of the business assets we transfer to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Sites or applicable database.  Hence, GS1 US reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including Personal Information in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of certain of GS1 US’s stock and/or assets, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.

**Legal Protections and Law Enforcement**. GS1 US may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose your information, including Personal Information, Usage Information and Device Identifier (including IP address), to third parties: (i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests or legal process if in our good faith opinion such is required or permitted by law; (ii) to protect and/or defend the [](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use)Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Sites, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (iii) to protect the safety, rights, property or security of GS1 US or any third party; and/or (iv) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we may use IP address or other Device Identifiers, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with third parties such as copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers and/or law enforcement agencies, including disclosing such information to third parties, all in our discretion.  Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

**EEOC / Affirmative Action Reporting**.  Please note that if you apply for a job with GS1 US, then in conjunction with laws and regulations enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“ **EEOC** ”), the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (“ **OFCCP** ”) and similar state and local regulatory agencies, we may ask you to provide us with self-identifying information (such as veteran status, gender and ethnicity).  Providing such self-identifying information is voluntary, but if you do provide us with such information, we may submit that information to the EEOC, the OFCCP and similar state and local regulatory agencies for business-related purposes, including, without limitation, responding to information requests, fulfilling regulatory reporting requirements and defending against employment related complaints. 

**4.  INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY ON OUR SITES**

Our Sites may offer message boards, chat rooms and other public areas (collectively, “ **Community Forums** ”) where you can engage in social networking, interact with others, as well as have the opportunity to submit photographs, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, “ **User Submissions** ”).  To participate in certain Community Forums, you may be asked to select a username, screen name or member name and password. 

**_Note that anything you post to a Community Forum is public_** – others will have access to your User Submissions and may use it or share it with third parties. Information you choose to post or make available in the Community Forums may be viewed, collected and used by others. If you choose to voluntarily disclose User Submissions, the protections of this Privacy Policy will not cover such disclosure of information. Think carefully before you post and use caution before disclosing any Personal Information. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any content or information that you disclose or receive through the Sites.

User Submissions may be published online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed).  We may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personal Information with your User Submissions, and GS1 US may use the content, or any portion of the content, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities.  For full terms and conditions regarding User Submissions you submit to the Sites, please review our [Terms of Use.](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use)

**5.  INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES **

GS1 US may receive information about you from third parties.  For example, if you are on another web site and you opt-in to receive information from GS1 US, that web site will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested.  You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as a Facebook application or a similar application or feature on a third party web site) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information.  The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected.  In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.  And, if you choose to “like” content on our Sites or to otherwise post information from or via our Sites to a third party web site, feature or application, that information will become public and the third party web site may have access to information about you and your use of our Sites. 

We may also supplement the information we collect about you through the Sites with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with information we collect through the Sites.  In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

**6. AD SERVING AND TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT SERVICES WE MAY USE; HOW TO “OPT OUT” OF RECEIVING ADVERTISING RELEVANT TO YOU**

GS1 US may use third party network advertisers and similar vendors to serve our advertisements across the internet and third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Sites and viewing of our content.  Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Sites and other locations you have visited.  Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.  The Sites’ third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier.  Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.  Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.

With regard to advertisements, we and our network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the Sites and other web sites.  Cookies web beacons and other technologies, including those set by third party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, or to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.  We may share Usage Information about visitors to the Sites with third party advertising companies for the same purposes. By using the Sites, you further agree that GS1 US may change, alter, or modify the settings or configurations on your Internet Device in order to allow for or optimize your use of the Sites. We may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements. You may wish to visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>, which provides information regarding the “opt-out” procedures of certain third party ad servers we may use; provided, however we are not responsible for the procedures used by these third parties.

**7.  UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION AND OPTING-OUT FROM SHARING YOUR INFORMATION**

GS1 US may provide web pages or other mechanisms through the Sites which you can correct or update some of the Personal Information you have provided to us, including, without limitation, through registration with the Sites.  You can also contact Customer Service to update your information at +1 866.280.4013. 

If you have consented to have your information shared with third parties for their marketing purposes and you later decide you want to opt-out from future sharing or if you decide you do not want your information shared with GS1 US affiliates or member companies in the future, you can do so by either using the web pages or mechanisms on the Site (if and when they become available), or by calling us at +1 866.280.4013.

If you receive a marketing communication from us by e-mail, and you later decide you want to opt-out from receiving future commercial e-mails, you may opt-out by following the opt-out instructions provided to you in that e-mail.  Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the transactions you initiate, your account or your use of the Sites and these transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from marketing communications. 

In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Sites.  We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information.  In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons. Also, if you have made any public postings on a social networking feature, such as in a Community Forum or other community sections of the Sites, these communications may not generally be removed. 

**8.    SECURITY **

We incorporate commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Sites and provide us with your information at your own risk. 

**9. THIRD PARTY CONTENT, LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES AND OTHER WEB SITES THAT DISPLAY OR CONTAIN GS1 US CONTENT**

When you are on the Sites you may see certain content that is served by someone else and you may be directed to other content or web sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that are beyond our control.  This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding agreement and other links off or our Site.  In addition, GS1 US widgets or other GS1 US content may be included on web pages and web sites that are not associated with GS1 US and over which we have no control.  These third parties may send their own cookies and similar tracking technologies to your Device, they may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. GS1 US is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party. 

**10. CONSENT TO TRANSFER **

The Sites are operated in the United States.  If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States.  The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States.  By using the Sites, or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.

**11. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES AND YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY; PRIVACY QUESTIONS**

GS1 US reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice to you, and any changes will become effective immediately upon posting.  However, GS1 US will use your Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you consent to the new or revised policy.  If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at [legal@gs1us.org](mailto:legal@gs1us.org).
