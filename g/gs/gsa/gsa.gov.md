Privacy and Security Policy for GSA Websites

Thank you for visiting the GSA Website and reviewing our privacy policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us.

How we handle the information we gather when you visit our web site

We collect and store only the following information about you:  The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (i.e., erols.com, if you are connecting from an Erols account, or harvard.edu if you are connecting from Harvard University's domain); the date and time you access our site; the item you requested from the server; and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site. If your browser accepts cookies we may use a cookie to determine if you are a repeat or new visitor, or to understand how many different visitors come to our sites. When we examine this data, it is always presented in an aggregate form. Except as outlined in the Security section at the bottom of this document, we do not track or look at individuals' usage behavior.

For more information on cookies, and how they are used in GSA.gov, please refer to our [Cookies Page](https://web.archive.org/web/20010603224512id_/http%3A//www.gsa.gov/Portal/cookies.jsp). 

If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail: 

When you send us personally-identifying information, (e.g., in an electronic mail message containing a question or comment), or by filling out a form that E-mails us this information, we use this information to respond to your request. We may also forward your E-mail to other Government employees, who are better able to answer your questions. 

**_We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, or as otherwise required by law, we do not share any information we receive with any outside parties._**

Links to other sites: 

The documents posted on this Website may contain hypertext links or pointers to information created and maintained by other public and private organizations. These links and pointers are provided for visitors' convenience. GSA does not control or guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of any linked information from non-GSA sites. 

The inclusion of links or pointers to Web sites is not intended to assign importance to those sites or the information contained therein, nor is it intended to endorse or recommend any views expressed, or products or services offered on these sites. 

Personalization: 

Some GSA sites allow you to personalize them, either by selecting sets of content to place on a web page or by clicking on an icon indicating a desire for a certain kind of content. In some cases, you are asked to "register" in order to get this personalized content. If you provide personally-identifying information when registering for personalized content, that information is only used to deliver the content to you. The information is never shared with any third party. 

Security:

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, GSA webservers employ industry-standard methods to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on GSA servers are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. 

In the specific context of this security monitoring, there is no expectation of privacy. However, only in the case of actual law enforcement investigations, will we attempt to identify individual users or their usage habits.
