#### PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE GSN TERMS OF SERVICE BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE OR ANY GSN FORUM 

This Privacy Policy Statement ("Privacy Policy") is applicable to the Game Show Network ("GSN") Website located at http://www.gsn.com/ (the "Website"), and all services provided thereon ("Services"), including all GSN Forums ( as defined in the Terms of Service ) . This Privacy Policy does not cover any interaction you may have with GSN by telephone, postal mail, or other offline communications. 

#### Notice 

GSN respects your privacy and is committed to protecting personal information that you provide in connection with your use of the Website. This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you notice of GSN's information practices, including the types of information gathered, how the information is used and safeguarded, and how you may control the maintenance and sharing of your information. 

#### Collection of Personally Identifiable Information 

You can visit GSN at any time without providing any information about yourself. However, in order to use certain portions of the Services (e.g., to play games, access GSN Forums, or use other Services as described in the **[Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/cgi/corporate/terms.html?display=) **), you may be required to register and create an account with GSN ("GSN Account"). 

There is no cost to create a GSN Account but you will be asked to choose a member name (please do not use your real name or the real name of another person) and password, and to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your real name, age, address, telephone number, occupation and e-mail address. If you do provide GSN with personally identifiable information, we will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information. We also urge you to keep your password confidential and refrain from sharing it with others. GSN will not disclose, share, sell or rent personally identifiable information to any third party without your prior consent. 

Please note that your member name will be available to the Internet general public while you participate in certain GSN Forums such as message boards or chat rooms. 

Other than registration information, you may be asked to provide certain personal information in order to use or participate in certain promotions such as giveaways, sweepstakes, contests, surveys, newsletters, etc. ("Special Promotions"). In these instances, the Website will contain information regarding the intended use of the requested information. 

GSN may also use technology, such as cookies (as described below), transparent gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technologies as they are developed, to enhance your experience on GSN and in the use of GSN Services. 

#### Special Notice Regarding Children Under 13 Years of Age 

GSN respects the privacy of children of all ages. GSN particularly recognizes the sensitivity of personal information concerning children under the age of 13 and therefore provides this special notice to parents and guardians regarding the collection and use of information collected from children in this age group. 

This Website is not directed towards young children. GSN is intent on complying with applicable laws and regulations regarding children, including the United States ' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Specifically, GSN will not knowingly collect and maintain any personally identifiable information from children under 13. Parents are hereby put on notice that as a result of the foregoing, GSN does not provide a mechanism to obtain parental consent. 

If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her personal information, GSN will make reasonable efforts to delete the information from its database, at your request. To request the deletion of your child's information, please send an email to **[webmaster@gsn.com](mailto:webmaster@gsn.com)** and be sure to include in your message the same member name and password that your child submitted. 

#### Non-Personally Identifiable Information 

As part of the registration process to create a GSN Account or to participate in Special Promotions, you may be asked to provide certain information that does not personally identify you. For example, you may be asked to provide information concerning your television viewing habits, music or other entertainment preferences, purchasing habits, and the like. GSN requests this information in order to enhance your online experience by understanding you better and to also make you aware of new services, programs or offers which may be of interest to you. 

In general, you can browse GSN while remaining anonymous. However, in many cases, if you wish to interact on the Website, GSN will collect certain non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Services. For example, GSN might collect information concerning the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your "click path" through the GSN Website, the Website or advertisement from which you linked to the GSN Website, and/or the Website that you go to when leaving the GSN Website. In order to do this, GSN may use several technologies and perform system checks when a user visits the Website. Examples of such technologies are cookies (as described below), transparent gifs, frames, server log analysis, and other technologies as they are developed. All technologies implemented on the Website are used to enhance the user experience. 

GSN uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and transparent GIF files, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy>

As discussed above, in general, GSN uses information to improve and enhance the Services. However, from time to time, GSN may share this information with other entities in an aggregate, non-personally identifiable form to show general demographic and preference information among users of the GSN Website. 

#### Online Store 

The Website may contain an online store from which you can purchase certain products. We will be required to collect personal information such as name, contact information, shipping and billing addresses, and a credit card number in order to process your order. We may also keep records of your transactions with us. We may use the information you provide to us in order to communicate with you about products purchased, related customer support and to send you information about other products or services we believe may be of interest to you. 

#### Cookies 

When you visit the GSN Website or any advertisements appearing on the Website, or use one or more of the Services, we may use an industry-wide technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data that a Website can send to your browser, which may then store the cookie on your computer if your browser is enabled to accept cookies. Transparent gifs assist in the delivery of cookies and enable us to enhance your use of the Services. This technology allows us to better match your interests and preferences or simply to facilitate your signing in to use the Website and its Services. Most Internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please note, however, that if you block cookies, many portions of the Website will not function properly. You should refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about how to manage cookies. 

#### Use of Information Collected 

Except as specifically outlined in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your personal information with non-affiliated third parties without your permission. We may disclose aggregated information, such as demographic information, and certain statistical analysis to third parties, including advertisers and other business partners. This aggregated information will include any personal information. We may, however, share your personal information with our owners and other affiliated companies, including Sony Pictures Entertainment, Liberty Media, and their parents, subsidiaries, or affiliated companies, in order to provide portions of the Website and/or Services (e.g., to provide fulfillment for prizes won in a GSN sweepstakes or contest), or to provide other support for a GSN promotion. Please refer to the individual privacy policies of our affiliates for details concerning how they handle your personal and non-personal information. 

GSN will not disclose your personal information to non-affiliated third parties, unless we have previously informed you of the disclosure, have been given your consent to disclose, or we are required by law to disclose. In the case of Special Promotions, the name of any third parties involved in the promotion will be disclosed, and when applicable, you may be given the option of providing your information to them. We reserve the right to disclose non-personal information in any way we deem appropriate. 

GSN uses third party vendors to provide portions of the Website and its Services. By using the Services, you are deemed to consent to the use of these vendors. These vendors are contractually restricted to using personal information for the sole purpose of providing the Services and are strictly prohibited from sharing, selling, or otherwise distributing any personal data of our customers. 

As stated in the Terms of Service, you will be deemed to have consented to the transfer and/or disclosure to a subsequent owner of this Website, of any personal information submitted by you and contained in GSN's database if GSN assigns all of its rights and obligations regarding the use of your personal information at the time of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of GSN's assets. 

Third-party advertisers may deliver specific advertisements to you on the Website. Such advertisers may collect non-personal information about your visits to the Website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you. These companies may also aggregate your non-personal information for use in targeted advertising, marketing research and other similar purposes. These companies may also place their own cookies on your computer. For a list of these commercial and advertising agencies and their privacy policies, as well as more information about your option not to accept cookies or clear gifs placed by these companies, please the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) website. You can also visit each third-party advertiser's applicable website directly in order to opt-out from their use of this information.

#### Our Commitment to Data Security 

If you give GSN sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers), GSN will take all commercially reasonable steps to protect such information by establishing a secure connection with your Web browser. GSN employs a security technology known as a secure-socket-layer ("SSL") to protect the transmission of payment information to the Website. Unless otherwise specified herein or on the Website, credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing or any other purposes. 

While GSN takes precautions against possible breaches in its databases, no Website or internet transmission or connection is completely secure. Consequently, GSN cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. 

GSN urges you to keep your personal information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place, separate from your account information, as sharing your password with others may lead to unauthorized access to your information. 

#### Postings to GSN Forums 

All postings, whether in a chat room, on message boards or other method of communication within the Forums will generally be available to, and freely accessible by, other users of the GSN Forums as well as the Internet general public. Therefore, users should not expect that any information they post will be kept private or confidential and are encouraged to exercise discretion when using the GSN Forums. Additionally, your member name will always be included in conjunction with your postings in the GSN Forums. GSN is not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through the Forums. 

#### Hyperlinks To and From Other Websites 

The Website may contain links to, or advertisements concerning, other websites. Other websites may also reference, advertise, or link to GSN. GSN is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites and expressly disclaims all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, such other websites and advertisements. You should check the applicable privacy policy of any website you may click through to. 

#### Consent to Processing in the United States

By providing any personal information to the Website, all users, including, without limitation, users in the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the United States of America . 

#### Maintaining and Updating Your Account Information

As part of your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining and updating, as applicable, your Registration Information with current and complete information.

After receiving any requested changes to your information, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that all of your person information stored in databases we actively use to operate the Website will be updated, corrected, changes or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable. However, we reserve the right to retain in our archival files any information we remove from or change in our active website databases. We may retain such information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Service. In addition, it may not be technologically possible to remove every record of the information you have previously provided us, as a copy may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. 

If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13, and you have discovered that your child created an account and would like to have it deleted, please e-mail us at [mailto:GSNprivacy@gsn.com](mailto:GSNprivacy@gsn.com)with your child's member name and password.
