<p></p>

<p>Some of these Cookies are technical (i.e., they allow us to provide the Services) and some are non-technical (i.e., they provide analytics about the use of our Services, allow us to remember your preferences, or facilitate advertising).&nbsp; We also use third-party advertisers (each, a <strong>“Third-Party Advertiser”</strong>) to market, sell and display advertisements on our Services. These Third-Party Advertisers may recognize Cookies we have placed (or place their own Cookie) on your device to collect information about your use of the Services for use in connection with their advertising activities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How we use Cookies </strong></p>

<p>We use both persistent and session Cookies.&nbsp; Persistent Cookies are used to improve your experience on our Services.&nbsp; This includes, for example, recording your acceptance of our Cookie Policy to remove the Cookie message that first appears when you use our Services. Session Cookies are temporary and are deleted from your device when your web browser closes.&nbsp; We use session Cookies to help us track internet usage.</p>

<p><strong>How to delete Cookies </strong></p>

<p>Most web browsers accept Cookies automatically.&nbsp; However, you can delete Cookies manually or set your browser to automatically delete Cookies on a pre-determined schedule.&nbsp; Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new Cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new Cookie and how to disable existing Cookies.&nbsp; You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking “help” on your browser's menu or by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note that if you decline to accept Cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of the Services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most browsers allow users to use a “private mode” by which Cookies are deleted after your website visit.&nbsp; Please read the help section of your browser to learn more about how to activate the “private mode.”&nbsp; You can still visit our website if your browser is in “private mode,” however, the user experience may not be optimal and some utilities may not work.</p>

<p>If you want to remove previously-stored Cookies, you can manually delete the Cookies at any time. However, this will not prevent the Services from placing further Cookies on your device unless and until you adjust your browser setting as described above.</p>

<p>For more information on the development of user-profiles and the use of targeting/advertising Cookies, please see www.youronlinechoices.eu, if you are located in the EU, or www.aboutads.info/choices, if in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Adobe Flash Player</strong></p>

<p>Our Services enable the use of the Adobe Flash Player, which generates “flash cookies” by default.&nbsp; Flash cookies remember user settings, preferences and usage similar to the browser Cookies referenced above, but flash cookies can store more information than browser Cookies and are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can control the degree to which you accept flash cookies by accessing your Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the settings manager for Adobe Flash, located at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.&nbsp; If you do not allow flash cookies to take any disc space on your computer, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features on the Service.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our web pages or e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon which allows us to monitor and collect certain limited information about our users, such as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. We may use web beacons to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate our Services, and we may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many of the messages we sent were actually opened or acted upon.</p>

<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An IP Address is a number that is assigned to your mobile device, computer or network when you are linked to the Internet.&nbsp; When you request pages from our Services, our servers log your IP Address. We may use IP Addresses for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the use of the Services.&nbsp; We may associate your IP address with other personal data you provide.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Advertisers and Third-Party Analytics</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ad Serving Technology</strong></p>

<p>Third-party advertising companies (each, a <strong>“Third-Party Ad Company”</strong>), also may use Cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons or other technologies to collect information to ensure that appropriate advertising is delivered when you use the Services, calculate or control the number of unique and repeat views of a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The data that Third-Party Ad Company may collect for this purpose includes your IP address; device ID; information about your software, applications and hardware; machine or device make and model; advertisement(s) served; in-game location; length of time an advertisement was visible; other Internet and website usage information; web pages and mobile Internet sites which have been viewed by you (as well as date and time); domain type; size of the advertisement; advertisement response (if any); and angle of view.&nbsp; If you click on an ad that appears on the Services, data, such as your IP address, may be revealed to the advertiser (or the applicable Third-Party Ad Company).</p>

<p>The Third-Party Ad Company that deliver ads may combine the personal data collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products.&nbsp; The collection and use by Third-Party Ad Company of personal data obtained through the Services and information they have independently collected from other services or products is governed by their own privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, GSN uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partners (each, a “<strong>Management Partner</strong>”), who use them to recognize a unique Cookie placed by us or by another advertiser who works with the applicable Management Partner.&nbsp; The Management Partner may set and access its own Cookies on your web browser in order to serve ads it believes may be of interest to you based on the profile information you provided to us at registration (e.g., demographic information), your browsing behavior on the Services, as well as information collected about you by the applicable Management Partner elsewhere online.&nbsp; Management Partners may use information about you gathered from the Services to serve third-party ads to you elsewhere on the Internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>

<p>GSN uses third-party web analytics services that collect and analyze our users’ data, such as device ID and IP address, to provide us with statistical information, such as where our users are located in the world, what content users view on our Services, and the size of our user base.&nbsp; We use this information to improve and personalize our Services.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>How We Protect Your Personal Data</strong></p>

<p>GSN has implemented an information security program that includes physical, technical and procedural safeguards designed to protect your personal data.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="Section8"><strong>Data Retention</strong></a></p>

<p>GSN will retain your personal data as needed to provide you with access to our Services and/or for as long as is necessary for the protection and pursuit of our legal rights and obligations under any laws that are applicable to our operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="Section9"><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong></a></p>

<p>The Services may contain links to, or advertisements concerning, other websites. Other websites may also reference, advertise, or link to GSN. GSN is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. You should check the applicable privacy policy of any website you access through the Services.</p>

<p><a name="Section10"><strong>Location and Transfer of Personal Data</strong></a></p>
