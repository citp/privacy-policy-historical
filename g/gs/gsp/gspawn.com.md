  * Cookies.  The Website may place small files, called “cookies” onto your computer.  Cookies are data files that websites write onto computer hard drives for record keeping purposes when you visit them.  The cookie file then identifies you as a unique user.  As a convenience feature, cookies simplify the process of recording personal information, so that, for example, users do not have to enter names, addresses or passwords repetitively.  Cookies also allow users of the Website to customize certain site features. You can program your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to use certain portions of the Website and the Website will not be able to customize certain features according to your preferences.

  * Mobile Device Identifiers.  Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we, our Partners or our third party service providers may receive such device information if you access the Website through a mobile device.  Certain features on the Website may require collection of mobile phone numbers and we may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information.  Additionally, some mobile service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their services.  Depending on the provider, we, our Partners or our third party service providers may receive this information.

An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your use of this Website, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded to your computer from our web server or a third party provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website and is deactivated or deleted once you leave the Website.
