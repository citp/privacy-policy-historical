<p><strong>Collection and Use of Information</strong></p>
<p>We collect your Personal Information when you provide it to us while visiting the Website, such as when you create an account, purchase our products, enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion, sign up for our mailing list, post comments on the Website’s blog space, request information or otherwise interact with this Website.</p>

<p>Website Usage Information is tracked and gathered when you visit the Website and your web browser or software communicates certain information to the Website. &nbsp;We use this information to generate statistics about visitors to the Website, detect broad demographic trends, enhance the Website’s security, provide content tailored to your interests and to otherwise enhance your experience on the Website.</p>
<p><strong>Passive Collection of Information</strong></p>
<p>In addition to actively collecting Personal Information from you, we, our subsidiaries, affiliates, joint venturers, strategic alliance partners, sponsors and advertisers (“Partners”) and our third party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically collect Website Usage Information and some Personal Information when you visit this Website. &nbsp;The methods used to collect this information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies. &nbsp;The Website may place small files, called “cookies” onto your computer. &nbsp;Cookies are data files that websites write onto computer hard drives for record keeping purposes when you visit them. &nbsp;The cookie file then identifies you as a unique user. &nbsp;As a convenience feature, cookies simplify the process of recording personal information, so that, for example, users do not have to enter names, addresses or passwords repetitively. &nbsp;Cookies also allow users of the Website to customize certain site features. You can program your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to use certain portions of the Website and the Website will not be able to customize certain features according to your preferences.</li>
<li>Web Beacons. &nbsp;Small graphic images or web programming code called web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) may be included on the pages of the Website and in email messages we send you. &nbsp;Web beacons or other similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, such as to count visitors to the Website, monitor how you navigate the Website or to count how many particular articles or links posted on the Website were actually viewed.</li>
<li>Mobile Device Identifiers. &nbsp;Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we, our Partners or our third party service providers may receive such device information if you access the Website through a mobile device. &nbsp;Certain features on the Website may require collection of mobile phone numbers and we may associate that phone number to mobile device identification information. &nbsp;Additionally, some mobile service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their services. &nbsp;Depending on the provider, we, our Partners or our third party service providers may receive this information.</li>
<li>Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your use of this Website, such as the links you click on. &nbsp;The code is temporarily downloaded to your computer from our web server or a third party provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website and is deactivated or deleted once you leave the Website.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION </strong></p>
<p>We share your Personal Information and Website Usage Information with our Partners. &nbsp;In addition, we may also share your Personal Information and Website Usage Information with certain non-affiliated third parties, but only as set forth below:</p>
