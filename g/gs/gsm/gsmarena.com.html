<p><b>Last Updated:</b> May 24, 2018</p>

<p>In compliance with the European Union legislation, we inform you that our website GSMArena.com will store some information about your preferences inside a tiny text file called a 'cookie'.</p>

<p>A cookie is a small piece of data, which a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to "remember" your actions or preferences over time.</p>

<p>You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer, and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being saved. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site, and some services and functionality may not work.</p>

<p>GSMArena.com uses cookies to:</p>

<ul class="article-blurb">
<li>Identify you as a returning user and to count your visits in our traffic statistics analysis
</li><li>Remember you display preferences
</li><li>Remembers the last 5 phones/devices that you searched for in our search field
</li><li>Additional usability features including the state of the GSMArena sub-menu and whether you've already given your consent to use cookies
</li></ul>

<p>Enabling cookies from GSMarena.com is not strictly necessary for the website to work, but it will provide you with a better browsing experience.</p>

<p>The cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally, and the content is fully under our control. These cookies are not used for any purpose other than those described here.</p>

<h3>Third Party Cookies</h3>

<p>There may also be other types of cookies created after you've visited our website.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics, a popular web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us to analyze how users use the site. It counts the number of visitors and tells us things about their behavior overall - such as the typical length of stay on the site or the average number of pages a user views.</p>

<p>The information generated by the cookie about your use of our website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.</p>

<p>Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google undertakes not to associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.</p>

<h3>Third Party Ad Servers</h3>

<p>We may have third-party advertising companies serving ads to you when you visit our website. These companies may store information about your visits to our website and to other websites to provide you with relevant advertisements about goods and services.</p>

<p>These companies may employ cookies and other identifiers to measure advertising effectiveness. The information is generally not personally identifiable unless, for example, you provide personally identifiable information to them through an ad or an e-mail message.</p>

<p>If you would like to learn more about what options you have about limiting the gathering of information by third-party ad networks, you can consult the website of the Network Advertising Initiative.</p>

<p>You can opt out of participating in interest-based advertising networks but opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It just means that the companies from which you opted out will no longer customize ads based on your interests and web usage patterns using cookie-based technology.</p>

<h3>Controlling and opting out of cookies</h3>

<p>Your browser or device may offer settings that allow you to choose whether browser cookies are set and to delete them.  For more information about these controls and to exercise your cookie preferences, visit your browser or device's help material.  If you choose to reject cookies, as noted above, you may not be able to use certain features of our websites and services.</p>

<p>A third-party website called <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aboutcookies.org</a> has been setup to help you with instructions how you can do that on various browsers.</p>

<h3>Do Not Track</h3>

<p>Some browsers include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track" signals.  We do not process or respond to "Do Not Track" signals.  Instead, we adhere to the standards described in our Privacy Statement and this Cookie Statement.</p>
