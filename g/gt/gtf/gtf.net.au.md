### What personal information we collect

We only collect personal information from you if it is relevant to our relationship with you and necessary to provide our services. Various pages on this website invite you to provide personal information. When you register your interest or purchase products on-line, the personal information we collect includes your name, billing and delivery addresses, delivery instructions, credit card details, email address, contact phone numbers, address, confirmation that you are over 18, details of your operating system and some statistical information about your household. If you are an Green tree frog customer, we may ask you for your user name, password, driver's license number, date of birth and mother's maiden name for the purpose of identifying you over the telephone. We also hold details of the services we provide to our customers, such as usage details.

If you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the services you require.

### How we collect personal information

We only collect personal information directly from you on-line or on the phone. We only collect personal information by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way. We do not collect any 'sensitive information', such as information relating to your race, political opinions, membership of a political association or trade association, religious beliefs or sexual preferences.

When we collect personal information we take steps to ensure that you are made aware of what information we are collecting, how that information is used and to whom it is disclosed. We do this by displaying a link to this privacy policy and collection statement wherever we collect information.

### We do not collect information from children

To sign up to an Green tree frog contract and select a plan, you must be at least 18 years old. In all other cases, for example if you use the Contact Us form, no information may be submitted to us by persons under the age of 13 without the consent of a parent or legal guardian.

### How we use personal information

We only use your personal information for the purpose for which we collected it in the first place - that is to provide you with our goods and services. We do not use your information for direct marketing purposes. We limit our use and disclosure of your personal information to those uses which are necessary to provide our services to you.

### We do not share your personal information

We do not share, sell or trade personal information to anyone else. In some circumstances it may be necessary to disclose your information to our third party service providers, such as a call centre provider. In all cases, we ensure that your information is secure and that you are afforded the same level of privacy protection.

### Your personal information is secure

There are always risks with providing personal information, whether in person, by phone or over the Internet. No technology is completely safe, tamper-proof or hacker-proof. However, we take considerable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification and disclosure. We use up-to-date techniques and processes, which are consistent with current industry standards to keep your personal information secure and confidential.

### Your credit card details

All your credit card information is transmitted to our secure server through a multi-layered encryption mechanism so that no-one can intercept or tamper with your information as it passes over the Internet. We frequently review and update our security systems to ensure that your credit card details are afforded among the best standards of protection available.

### Identifying yourself over the phone

So we can ensure that you are who you say you are, if you contact us by phone, we will ask you to provide identifying information such as your user name, password, mother's maiden name and driver's licence number. If you are unable to provide this information, we may not be able to provide the service you require.
