# Privacy Policy | GTmetrix

Your privacy is important to us and GTmetrix ("we", "us", "our") is committed to keeping your information secure. This Privacy Policy is provided to help you better understand how we collect and use your information. 

This policy is effective as of May 25th, 2018. 

* * *

## What information do we collect?

We collect information about you when you provide it to us and when you use GTmetrix, as described below. 

### Information you provide to us

We collect information about you that you provide to us: 

  * **Basic Account information:** If you register for a GTmetrix account, we collect your name (optional) and e-mail address.
  * **Payment information:** If you sign up for a GTmetrix PRO account, we collect your payment information.
  * **Test details:** If you use the test options (e.g. Cookies, HTTP authentication) when performing a GTmetrix test, those settings are saved for future tests.
  * **Communications with us:** If you contact us via the [Contact form](https://web.archive.org/contact.html), e-mail or social media, this information is collected.



### Information we collect automatically

We also collect some information automatically: 

  * **Logs:** Like most services, we log access to our services in log files. This data includes date and time of access, IP address, browser user agent and the page visited.
  * **Usage information:** We collect information on how you are using GTmetrix.
  * **Cookies / Web storage:** We use cookies and web storage (i.e. localStorage/sessionStorage) for the sole purpose of preserving state. For example, to remember who you are logged in as, or to remember where you are in performing a task.



### Information we receive from other sources

The only third party source we collect information from is Google Analytics; a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to enable analysis of your use of the website. 

In using Google Analytics, GTmetrix employs the "anonymizeIp" feature which masks part of your IP address before storing or processing it. 

Our Google Analytics is configured to disable all data sharing options (i.e. our Google Analytics data is not shared with other Google products and services). Google Analytics' advertising features are also disabled (i.e. Remarketing and Advertising Reporting features). 

You can disable Google Analytics tracking completely by using the [Google Analytics Opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

  * **To communicate with you about GTmetrix:** We use your contact information to send you e-mail directly relating to GTmetrix (e.g. account validation, onboarding, PRO subscription, monitored page alerts). If you have opted-in, we also send you other non-essential GTmetrix e-mail (e.g. Newsletter, Tips and Insights, Promotions). You can change your communications settings from the [User Settings page](https://web.archive.org/dashboard/user_settings).
  * **To resolve customer support issues:** When you contact us for support, we may use your information to help resolve your problem.
  * **To improve GTmetrix:** We use usage information and customer feedback to identify issues with GTmetrix and make improvements to the service.
