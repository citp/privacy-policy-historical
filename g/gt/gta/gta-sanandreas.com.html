<p><strong>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</strong> <br>
  We are the sole owners of the information collected on this   site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily   give us via email or other direct contact from you.  We will not sell or   rent this information to anyone. </p>
<p>We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. </p>
<p>We will use your information to respond to you, regarding   the reason you contacted us.  We will not share your information with   any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to   fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order. </p>
<p>Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in   the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or   changes to this privacy policy. </p>
<p><strong>Your Access to and Control Over Information</strong> <br>
  You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time.    You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email   address or phone number given on our website: </p>

<p><strong>Security</strong> <br>
  We take precautions to protect your information.  When you   submit sensitive information via the website, your information is   protected both online and offline. </p>
<p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit   card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a   secure way.  You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at   the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning   of the address of the web page. </p>
<p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information   transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only   employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for   example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally   identifiable information.  The computers/servers in which we store   personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. </p>
