**Do you collect passwords?**

We use Google sign-in to authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your email address. _We do not collect or have access to your password._ The information you provide is held in strict confidence. We collect this information to generate your user license, send payment receipts and communicate with the user about product updates etc. 

Our services use the Google OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication without requiring the user to share their login credentials with us. OAuth also allows secure access to the user’s data, as required by the add-ons, and the data resides strictly inside your Google account. We do not store any of your account data on our servers.

**What information does Gtricks collect? How is this information used?**

Below is the comprehensive list of all type of information we may collect but not necessarily collect. For example, for our blog articles, we do not collect email address but for our apps, we might require the email address to send reports.

When a user registers online for our products, we will try to verify the identity. We will also collect billing and payment information via third-party payment partners. With your email address, we will send you periodic information, offers, and other content. You can opt out of these emails at any time, but a few service emails like confirmation emails, billing receipts etc. will still be sent to you for an optimum experience. We use the information collected to deliver services, update our records, communicate with you about products and services, and generally maintain your accounts with us. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you services, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you wish to cancel your account or want we no longer use your information you can opt out by contacting us. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We might share them as described in this privacy policy but only to give you a better experience like conducting surveys on your email address.

For these co-branded offerings in which a third party is involved in your transactions, we will sometimes share or jointly collect customer information related to those transactions with that third party. On the co-branded registration pages we will state who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs its use so that you will know at the time you create your account exactly how your information will be used. If you are registered with Gtricks through a partnership and you request to opt out of receiving promotional and other updates, you can optout by contacting us. We will also provide your email address to that partner so that they may also discontinue sending you messages on behalf of Gtricks.
