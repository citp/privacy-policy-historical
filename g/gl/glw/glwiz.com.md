Personal information that is collected by GLWiZ, its related companies and affiliates (collectively "GLWiZ") includes information about an identifiable individual such as the individual's name, address, e-mail and telephone number as well as their financial information (like account or credit card numbers). Although personal information will be predominately collected from the individual, personal information may also be obtained with the consent of the individual from other sources (i.e. credit bureaus, financial institutions, etc). Nevertheless, any information obtained from such other sources will be subject to GLWiz's privacy policy as if the information originated from the individual him/herself. General contact information is used to send products, information, fulfill orders or get in touch with users, if necessary, to solve problems. Financial information is used to check the user's qualifications and bill the user for products and services ordered by the user. 

_(a) Linked Sites and Affiliates_ :  
Personal information collected from GLWiZ's affiliates, agencies and related institutions may also be combined with information obtained online at GLWiZ's website or at any of GLWiz's customer service centres.

Except as provided herein, GLWiZ will not collect, use or disclose any personal information without first obtaining the consent of the individual customer to such collection use and disclosure. GLWiZ will make every reasonable effort to ensure that the individual is advised of the purposes for which the personal information will be used. Further, GLWiz will only use the personal information for the purposes for which it was originally collected.  
Except as provided herein, GLWiZ will never use personal information collected for a purpose other than the one under which it was originally collected without first obtaining consent of the individual for such alternate use.

_(b) Disclosure to Third Parties_ :  
Except as provided herein, GLWiZ will not share the personal information of its customers with third parties except where such disclosure is consented to and except where such disclosure is necessary in responding to the customer's request for products or services. In such cases and where ever possible GLWiZ will request consent to third party disclosure at the time the personal information is collected. 

_(c) Disclosure required by law or under special circumstances_ :  
GLWiZ will access, collect and/or disclose personal information where required to do so by law pursuant to a search warrant, court order or other valid legal request, or under special circumstances where there exists a good faith belief that such access, collection and/or disclosure are warranted. Examples of such special circumstances of collection and disclosure include medical or security reasons. GLWiZ may also disclose personal information to collection agencies for the purposes of collecting on accounts owing to GLWiz.  
Control of Personal Information and withdrawing Consent:

In this regard GLWiZ customers can access their personal information at any time by contacting GLWiz's Customer Service and submitting a written request for such access. GLWiz will provide the individual with particulars as to the disclosure of his/her personal information and shall provide the individual with access to that information. The individual will be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.  
To gain access to personal information held by GLWiZ the individual making the request will be required to provide sufficient information to permit GLWiZ to provide an account of the existence, use and disclosure of the personal information.
