# Privacy Policy

This privacy statement ("Privacy Policy") covers the website www.Gliffy.com, owned and operated by Gliffy, Inc. ("Gliffy", "we", "us", "our") and the products and services Gliffy provides. Gliffy knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting the Gliffy website, submitting information or using any of our products or services, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.

### What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers Gliffy's treatment of personal information that Gliffy gathers when you are on the Gliffy website and when you use Gliffy services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers Gliffy's treatment of any personal information that Gliffy's business partners share with Gliffy. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Gliffy does not own or control, or to individuals that Gliffy does not employ or manage.

### What Personal Information About Users Does Gliffy Collect?

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to personalize and improve our service. We collect the following types of information from our users:

### 1\. Information You Provide to Us:

We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The personal information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, communicating with you about specials, sales offers and new products, and improving our products and services.

We may collect such information from you by the following means:

  * Registration: In order for you to use our website, you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require your email address.
  * Gliffy Premium: To process your order for Gliffy Premium, we require contact information (such as billing address) and PayPal information. This information is used for billing purposes.
  * Feedback: You may accept our invitation to provide feedback or participate in surveys for our research purposes, including providing screenshots of how you use the Gliffy services.



### 2\. Automatic Information:

We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Gliffy may automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Gliffy cookie information, and the page you requested. Gliffy uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the website.

Generally, our service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our website and its components. This data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the website, so we can make the website appealing to as many users as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our website. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their areas and our website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal Web experience.

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Gliffy will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.

### 3\. E-mail Communications:

We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Gliffy if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We may also send out emails with news or promotions. If you do not want to receive e-email or other mail from us, please update your profile under the "Profile" section of the website.

### 4\. Information from Other Sources:

For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

### What About Cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Gliffy cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your email address is.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Gliffy's most attractive features.

Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

### Will Gliffy Share Any of the Information it Receives?

We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal information only with your consent or to the business partners and affiliates as described below:

### Affiliated Business We Do Not Control:

We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction. We will only share personal information that is necessary for the affiliate to complete the transaction. We require our affiliates to provide the same level of privacy protection that we do and they do not have the right to share or use personal information for any purpose other than for an authorized transaction.

### Personnel:

Our personnel (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consultants and/or contractors) may have access to user information while carrying out their duties in the normal course of our company business.

### Agents:

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, collecting and analyzing data relating to your visit to our website, providing marketing assistance, processing payments, and providing customer service. You hereby consent to our sharing of your personal information for the above purposes.

We utilize the following Google Analytics Features to help us collect and analyze data related to your visit to our website such as page views and average time on page:

  * [Demographics and Interests Reporting](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357)
  * [Remarketing with Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2611268)



We may use this data with third-party cookies such as Adroll and Adwords Remarketing to later serve targeted display banners or text ads to you on the Google Display Network and other ad exchanges such as Facebook.

You may opt out of the Google Analytics Features by following the instructions in the following link: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>

We may also utilize various analytical tools to track how you interact with the Gliffy website and services. We change such analytical tools from time to time, but as of the date this Privacy Policy was last revised, these analytical tools included Mixpanel ([https://mixpanel.com](https://mixpanel.com/)), Amplitude ([https://amplitude.com](https://amplitude.com/)), Marketo ([https://www.marketo.com](https://www.marketo.com/)) and Hubspot ([https://www.hubspot.com](https://www.hubspot.com/)). Such analytical tools may allow us to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). Please note that we do not respond to or honor “do not track” signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

This website uses the Lucky Orange analytics system to help improve usability and the customer experience. Lucky Orange may record mouse clicks, mouse movements and scrolling activity. Lucky Orange does not track this activity on any site that does not use the Lucky Orange system. You can choose to disable the Lucky Orange system at <http://www.luckyorange.com/disable.php>.

We use a third party payment processor to process payments made to us. In connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain any personally identifiable information or any financial information such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly to our third party processor, Stripe, whose use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy, which may be viewed at <https://stripe.com/us/privacy>.

### Promotional Offers:

We may send offers to certain users on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please update your profile under the "Profile" section of the website.

### Business Transfers:

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Gliffy, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

### Protection of Gliffy and Others:

We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Gliffy, our employees, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

### Is Information About Me Secure?

Gliffy has implemented technical and organizational measures, appropriate to the risk, to protect your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration and unauthorized disclosure or access. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information provided online.

Your Gliffy account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.

We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect the security of your personal information during transmission, which encrypts all of the information you input.

Only Gliffy employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are trained and kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.

### How Long Does Gliffy Retain My Information?

Gliffy retains the personal information that we collect about you for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We also may retain your personal information for a longer period of time on the basis of our legitimate interests in providing or marketing our services to you or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. Even if we delete some or all of your personal information, we may continue to retain and use information that has been aggregated or anonymized so that it can no longer be used for personal identification.

### What Information Can I Access?

You can access your personal information on our website and correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate by updating your profile under the "Profile" section of the website.

What Choices Do I Have?

As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, but then you may be unable to use certain features on our website.

  * You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the "What Personal Information About Users Does Gliffy Collect?" section above. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.
  * You may request deletion of your Gliffy account by sending an email to contacting us at our support page. Please note that some information may remain in our records after deletion of your account.
  * If you do not wish to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please update your profile under the "Profile" section of the website. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Gliffy website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.
  * As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive features.



### Can Children Use Gliffy's Services?

You must be 18 years and older to register to use the Gliffy website. As a result, Gliffy does not specifically collect information about children.

### EU and Swiss Privacy Shield

Gliffy complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Gliffy has certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view Gliffy’s certification page, please visit [http://www.privacyshield.gov](http://www.privacyshield.gov/).

_Types of EU and Swiss Personal Data Collected._  Our participation in the Privacy Shield applies to all personal information that is subject to this privacy policy and is received from the European Union and European Economic Area (“EU Personal Data”) and Switzerland (“Swiss Personal Data”). We will comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to all EU and Swiss Personal Data.

_Purposes of EU and Swiss Personal Data Collection and Use._  We will only process EU and Swiss Personal Data in ways that are compatible with the purpose for which we collected the EU and Swiss Personal Data, or for purposes that the individual or entity providing the EU and Swiss Personal Data later authorizes. Before we use your EU and Swiss Personal Data for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose for which it was collected or that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out. We maintain reasonable procedures to help ensure that EU and Swiss Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

_Disclosures for National Security or Law Enforcement._ _ _ Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your EU and Swiss Personal Data in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

_Access Rights._  You may have the right to access the EU and Swiss Personal Data that we hold about you and to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield. These access rights may not apply in some cases, including where providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access. If you would like to request access to, correction, amendment, or deletion of your EU and Swiss Personal Data, you can submit a written request to us as provided in the  _Questions or Concerns_  section below. We may request specific information from you to confirm your identity. In some circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee for access to your information. We will provide an individual opt-out choice before we share their data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, you may submit a written request to support(at)gliffy(dot)com.

_Data Transfers to Third Parties._  Our accountability for EU and Swiss Personal Data that we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, we remain responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process EU and Swiss Personal Data on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

_Questions or Complaints._  In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we have committed to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact Gliffy at support(at)gliffy(dot)com.

Gliffy has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, JAMS. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, you may visit <https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield> for more information and to file a complaint.

Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.

Gliffy is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

### Additional European Union Privacy Rights
