**If we need to verify your identity**

In some circumstances we may be required by law or by our internal compliance procedures to take steps to verify the identity of the owners or companies officers of companies that we do business with. These checks are sometimes called “know your client” or “KYC” checks. As part of this process we will ask relevant individuals to provide certain information such as name, address and nationality. We will also ask for documentary evidence verifying these details, such as a copy of the individual’s passport and/or utility bill.

We will use the information that provided us for the purpose of complying with our legal or internal compliance obligations. Our legal basis for processing this personal information is that it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, alternatively that it is necessary for our legitimate interests in ensuring that we are conducting our business in a responsible way which complies with our internal standards.
