When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</p><h3>Cookies and Other Browser Information</h3><p>Our website automatically captures IP addresses. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, and to help ensure the security of your interaction with the website. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart.</p><p>Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers.</p><p>As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Gleez uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. All sections of gleez.com where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require your browser to accept cookies. </p><p>If you do not want your personal information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time if you accept them or not. However, you must understand that the use of cookies may be necessary to provide certain products or services, and choosing to reject cookies will reduce the performance and functionality of the site. Your browser documentation includes precise instructions explaining how to define the acceptance of cookies.</p><h3>Our Commitment to Data Security</h3><p>Gleez trains its employees on our privacy policy guidelines and makes our privacy policy available to our business partners. Our website uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your personal information when you send your personal information on our website. In addition, Gleez and its business partners enter into confidentiality agreements which require that care and precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your personal information.</p><h3>Public Forums Reminder</h3><p>This site often makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Although we value individual ideas and encourage free expression, Gleez reserves the right to take necessary action to preserve the forum's integrity, such as removing any posting that is vulgar or inappropriate.</p><h3>Our Commitment to Children's Online Privacy</h3><p>Out of special concern for children's privacy, Gleez does not knowingly accept online personal information from children under the age of 13. Gleez does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to become registered members of our sites, or buy products and services on our sites. Gleez does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information about children under 13.</p><p>In the event that Gleez ever decides to expand its intended site audience to include children under the age of 13, those specific web pages will, in accordance with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), be clearly identified and provide an explicit privacy notice addressed to children under 13. In addition, Gleez will provide an appropriate mechanism to obtain parental approval, allow parents to subsequently make changes to or request removal of their children's personal information, and provide access to any other information as required by law.</p><h3>About Links to Other Sites</h3><p>This site contains links to other sites. Gleez does not control the information collection of sites that can be reached through links from gleez.com. If you have questions about the data collection procedures of linked sites, please contact those companies directly.</p><h3>How to Access, Modify or Update Your Information</h3><p>Gleez gives you the ability to access, modify or update your information at any time. You may <a href="" target="_self">log in</a> and make changes to your login information (change your password), your contact information, your general preferences and your personalization settings. If necessary, you may also <a href="contact" target="_self">contact us</a> and describe the changes you want made to the information you have previously provided.</p><h3>How to Contact Us</h3><p>If you have any questions about any of these practices or Gleez's use of your personal information, please feel free to contact us <a href="contact" target="_self">by web</a>, or by E-mail at:</p><p>privacy@gleez.com</p><p>Gleez will work with you to resolve any concerns you may have about this Statement.</p><h3>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h3><p>Gleez reserves the right to change this policy from time to time. If we do make changes, the revised Privacy Statement will be posted on this site.</p><p>This Privacy Statement was last amended on June 30, 2005.</p><!-- google_ad_section_end -->
