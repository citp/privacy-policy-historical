# Gleam Privacy Policy

Here at Gleam we take privacy and security very seriously. This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Gleam collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the https://gleam.io website ("Site"). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products or services offered by Gleam.

## Personally Identifiable Information

We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, subscribe to our newsletter, fill out a form, or in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, email address. Users may, however, also visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.

Gleam discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Gleam’s behalf or to provide services available at Gleam’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be located outside of your home country; by using Gleam’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

Gleam will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations, as described above, Gleam discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Gleam believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Gleam, third parties or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of an Gleam website and have supplied your email address, Gleam may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Gleam and our products. We primarily use Email, Twitter, Facebook and our Blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of communication to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Gleam takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Non-Personal Identification Information

We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about Users means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilised and other similar information.

## Gleam Campaign Users

Companies that use Gleam to run campaigns may require users to supply certain information to them.

### Name + Email

By default each campaign will collect basic login information from users that includes their full name and email address. By entering campaigns you are accepting that campaign owners will have access to the information you provide.

### Social Logins

Gleam also allows you to connect social accounts to your profile. Companies that have social logins enabled on their Campaigns will be able to see information related to accounts that you connect. This includes but is not limited to your social profile URL's and associated profile photos.

  * Gleam does not know or store any passwords associated with your social accounts.
  * If you wish to remove the link between Gleam and any social network, you can remove the Gleam Competitions app inside that specific social network.



### Existing Users

Gleam is a distrubuted platform, which means that if a user is already logged into our widget they will continue to stay logged in across other Campaigns owned by other Companies.

Gleam does not provide any personal information to Companies that run contests until you complete at least 1 action in their Campaign. This means that you do not expose any personal information to Companies until you actively participate in a Campaign.
