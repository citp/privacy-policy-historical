PLEASE REVIEW THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION CAREFULLY. USE OF GLEANSTER.COM AND THE MATERIALS HEREIN WILL INDICATE YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PLEASE EXIT THIS SITE.

When you register on the Gleanster website, download a Gleansight benchmark report or purchase Gleanster products or services, we ask you for personal information. We use this information to provide you with high quality service and with recommendations that we think may be useful to you. We may also contact you regarding a website problem or other customer service-related issues. Note: Gleanster does not market to children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

If you are a registered user, this information is stored with your registration information. It is used solely to allow us to provide you with a personalized Web site experience. Aggregated (not personally identifiable) forms of this data may also be used in order to help us understand areas for future research and to identify features that can improve the website experience.
