#### II. Consignment and Consignee Data 

**Data Categories, Purposes of Processing Personal Data and Legal Basis**

For carrying out parcel services and therefore fulfilling the contract with its customers (the consignors) [According to Art. 6 (1)(b) GDPR] including in particular delivery of the parcel, payment of services, complaints management, quality and safety management, statistical performance data and compliance with relevant government bodies such as the Revenue Commission GLS needs consignor data (address details and further contact details, payment information and other relevant contractual data according to the services ordered by the consignor) as well as consignee data (name, address, postcode, city, country, optionally phone no. and e-mail address).

Consignee data transferred to GLS companies as well as interface documentation (scans of the parcels at different locations) and the proof of delivery (POD) may be processed and recorded by various GLS subsidiaries. GLS uses personal consignment and consignee data only for the fulfilment of its contractual obligations. Any further use is not permitted.

In some cases we may process data on consent basis [According to Art. 7 GDPR] or because of our legitimate interest [According to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR] (in particular regarding the following purposes: customer solvency checks, Compliance programme).

**Responsibility**

Compliance with the applicable statutory regulations on data protection is an original duty of each GLS company. The transfer of data by a consignor to a GLS company is no processing of data on behalf of others.

Additional services like the FlexDeliveryService and ShopDeliveryService require the e-mail address or phone number of the consignee to inform him/her about the status of the parcel delivery. GLS companies receive the telephone number and/or e-mail address from the consignor who ordered these additional services. The consignor is also responsible for the proper collection of this data and in particular the consent of the consignee to the transfer of his e-mail address and/or telephone number to GLS.

If you have questions regarding this procedure, please contact your contractual partner (the consignor). You can also express your withdrawal of consent towards GLS B.V. In this case please use the contact details of the GLS B.V. Data Protection Manager (I).

GLS companies will not sell or lease personal data to any third party. However, there are certain circumstances where GLS may share your personal data without additional notice to you. Parties which may receive your data include:

  * GLS subsidiaries and contractors in other EU countries or outside of the EU for the purpose of parcel delivery from the consignor to the consignee. [According to Art. 49 (1)(b); (1)(c) GDPR respectively.]
  * Affiliated or unaffiliated third parties that are under contract to perform services for or on behalf of GLS (Processors), in particular IT-Service providers. GLS B.V. has concluded appropriate data protection contracts with these parties.
  * Other persons or organisations as permitted by applicable law or regulation.
