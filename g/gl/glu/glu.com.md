This Glu Privacy Policy ("Policy") governs our recruitment of information we collect from you through our Web site at www.glu.com and our mobile site (collectively, the "Site"). We have adopted this Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your private information.

**IP Address and Cookies**  
We automatically track and collect your IP address and mobile identification number (MIN) when you visit our Site. This is anonymous information and does not identify you personally. This information may be used to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Site, or to gather broad demographic information. If you have enabled the use of cookies on your computer, we may write a cookie to your PC that includes only the fact that you are a visitor to the Site or customer of Glu. This may also help in the delivery of content that is specific to your interests and to help determine broad statistics related to your use of Glu's games and other information and services. 

**Contact and Demographic Information**  
If you communicate with us by e-mail or complete a registration form on the Site requiring you to give us contact information (like your name and email address), we may use your contact information to send you promotional material and offers in association with our partners, but only for offers that originate from Glu. In the event that you do not want to receive these offers, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of them.. We may also use your information to contact you when necessary, to verify or provide information in connection with providing our services. 

We may use demographic and profile data (such as your zip code, age, income, hobbies or affiliations) that you provide to us through e-mail or registration forms to tailor your experience at our Site, showing you content in which we think you might be interested. At the present time, we do not share any demographic or profile data with advertisers and other third parties on an individual basis. This information may be shared with advertisers on an aggregated basis. This means that all personally identifiable information is removed before this information is shared.

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy sites, companies or assets. In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets. In addition, we may, without specific or further notice to you, release your personally identifiable information when we believe such disclosure is appropriate to comply with law or a court order or other legal process, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Glu, the Site, our users or others. 

**Links**  
This Site contains links to other sites. Glu is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

**Security**  
This Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our security measures are consistent with generally accepted industry standards; however, it is not possible to guarantee that any security measures are unbreakable and Glu makes no such guarantee.

**Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy**  
We reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update or modify this Policy. We will notify you of any such addition, change, update or modification by posting it on the Site. Any such addition, change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site.
