# Privacy Policy – Gladius2

Thanks for visiting Gladius2.com. This policy explains the what, how and why the information we collect when you visit one of our websites. It also explains the specific ways we use and disclose that information.

## Definitions

These definitions should help you understand this policy. When we say “we”, “us” and “our”, we are referring to Gladius2.com. We provide online platforms that you may use to market to or stay in contact with others, including creating, sending, and managing emails and other information related to your subscribers. When we say “Member”, we are referring to the person or entity that is registered with us to use the Services. When we say “you,” we are referring either to a member or to some other person who visits any of our websites.

## Cookies

This site also collects non-personal information. A cookie is a small file that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive to help us improve content (e.g., it helps us determine which parts of the site are popular and which are less popular, so we may improve these areas in the future) and customize website content for our visitors. Cookies that we generate contain no personal information about you, and we will not combine cookie information with any personal information we have collected from you via this website.

## Links

Our site may contain links to other websites whose information practices may be different from ours. Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties, and our Privacy Policy does not cover activities occurring at other websites.

## Accuracy of Data, Transparency and Choice

We do our best to keep your data accurate and up to date, to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do so. If your data changes, then you are responsible for notifying us of those changes. Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as long as needed to provide you with our services.

## Do Not Track

Gladius2.com does not track the users of this web site over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
