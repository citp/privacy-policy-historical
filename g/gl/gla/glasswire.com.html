                <p>GlassWire is committed to protecting your privacy by collecting only the minimum amount of information needed to provide our software, website, and services.  Our company mission is to help people protect their privacy, data, and devices from threats.</p>

                <b>Does GlassWire see or collect my network or graph data? </b>

                <p><span style="border-bottom:1px solid black;">GlassWire does not ever see or collect any of your GlassWire network or graph data. </span> Your network and graph data stays on your computer and is never sent to our GlassWire servers.  Our business model is to sell our premium GlassWire software, not to collect or sell your data to advertisers.</p>

                <b>What information does GlassWire collect? </b>

                <p>GlassWire collects information from you when you register on our website or forum, email us, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form or download or install our software.</p>

                        <p>GlassWire Installation</p>
                        <p>When installing GlassWire our installer will contact GlassWire.com so we can know how many installs of our software have occurred. This helps us estimate how many users we have. If we did not count installs of GlassWire we wouldn’t know how many users we have.  Thank you for allowing us to count you as a GlassWire user.</p>
                        <p>After installing GlassWire you may notice on GlassWire's graph that GlassWire itself contacts GlassWire.com around once per day. GlassWire checks for software updates that may contain important security fixes and also updates its suspicious host list. GlassWire can block itself from accessing the Internet however if you do so then you may not know about important software updates and your suspicious host list may no longer be up to date.  Please note our suspicious host list does not come from GlassWire users.  We can never see your network data.</p>
