No, we do not sell individually identifiable information obtained on-line about our visitors to anyone outside of Glance Networks, Inc. The only exception to this rule is if we are required by law to release information.

If you provide individually identifiable information at an event Glance Networks, Inc. sponsors with another company, or if you subscribe or register on a co-sponsored or co-branded Web site, you may be providing the individually identifiable information to the co-sponsor. Review the privacy statement on the co-branded site to learn how the partner uses this information.

On occasion, Glance Networks, Inc. shares non-personally identifiable information with non-Glance Networks, Inc. companies in order to assess the results of a promotion. This information is used in aggregate only, and does not contain any information that would personally identify you. Information could be shared with an authorized Glance Networks reseller to fulfill a request for information or to follow up on an inquiry. We will inform you when your personally identifiable information is being shared and for what purposes.

Personal information submitted to Glance Networks through this Site may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Glance Networks its affiliates or authorized resellers maintain offices, including, without limitation, the United States. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Glance Networks. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.

Does Glance Networks use cookies and what does Glance do with the information collected?  
Yes. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.

Glance sets a session cookie when you log into your personal account at the Glance web site, so the site knows that you are logged in. The cookie is removed when you exit your browser. Glance also sets a cookie on your guest's computer when they view a Glance session. The cookie may be read if, at a future date, the person subscribes to the Glance service. This allows Glance to measure non-personally identifiable statistics on how users learned about the service.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. We may also use a cookie to make it easier for you to login and to help us determine site traffic patterns. This cookie contains no personal information other than your Glance Address. You can refuse to accept this cookie and still use Glance.

If you are a "cookie-phobe," you can set your browser to not accept any cookies, not accept permanent cookies, or tell it to erase all cookies at the end of a session. You will not be able to log into your Glance account if you refuse Glance's non-permanent session cookie.
