  * GlassWire Installation

When installing GlassWire our installer will contact GlassWire.com so we can know how many installs of our software have occurred. This helps us estimate how many users we have.

After installing GlassWire you may notice on GlassWire's graph that GlassWire itself contacts GlassWire.com around once per day. GlassWire checks for software updates that may contain important security fixes and also updates its suspicious host list. GlassWire can block itself from accessing the Internet however if you do so then you may not know about important software updates and your suspicious host list may no longer be up to date. Please note our suspicious host list does not come from GlassWire users. We can never see your network data.
