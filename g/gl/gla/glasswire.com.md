# GlassWire Privacy Policy

## Privacy Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you see or collect my network or graph data?

**No. Your network and graph data stays on your device and is never sent to our GlassWire servers.** We could not see or collect your GlassWire network or graph data even under a court order because we have no access to your network or graph data. Our business model is to [sell our premium GlassWire software](https://web.archive.org/buy/), not to collect or sell your network data to advertisers.

### Why does GlassWire’s desktop software access the network?

GlassWire’s software for desktop computers checks for software updates that may contain important security fixes along with updating its suspicious host list. GlassWire can block itself from accessing the network, however if you do so then you may not know about important software updates and GlassWire may not alert you if you connect to a suspicious host. GlassWire’s Android app does not ever access the network and has no suspicious host feature.

When installing or uninstalling GlassWire’s desktop software, our installer will contact GlassWire.com so we can know how many installs of our software have occurred. This contact sends your software version number, OS version, and if you’ve installed GlassWire before, along with an anonymized partial IP address and anonymized machine ID to us estimate how many users we have.

### Why does GlassWire for Android request the “phone” permission?

The Android OS requires the “phone” permission for us to see your mobile phone network data. Without this mobile phone permission, it’s impossible for our app to graph your phone’s mobile data. All similar Android apps work the same way. You can learn more details about this [on our Blog](https://blog.glasswire.com/2017/04/18/glasswire-android-permissions/). Of course GlassWire does not make phone calls with your phone and our Android app never accesses the network.

### How does GlassWire make money?

We make money through sales of our software. If you want to support future development of GlassWire you can [purchase GlassWire here](https://web.archive.org/buy/).

### How do I clear GlassWire's history?

Go to the top left GlassWire menu and turn on GlassWire's "Incognito" feature to keep no history at all, or simply go to GlassWire's top left menu and choose "settings" then click "clear" next to the "clear history" menu. For our Android app you can also clear your history in its settings the same way. Please note we can never see your history at all because it never leaves your device.

### I have a question or request about the EU GDPR, how can I contact you?

If your request concerns a purchase of our software please [contact our billing company Cleverbridge directly](https://www.cleverbridge.com/corporate/contact-us/). Cleverbridge is compliant with the GDPR and can make any GDPR related personal information requests you need. The GlassWire software does not collect personal information, but if you have a GDPR request regarding our websites please contact us directly so we can assist you. If you purchased our software and if you need to do something with your data as allowed by the GDPR please contact Cleverbridge, since they hold any personal data related to GlassWire sales.

### What information does GlassWire collect?

GlassWire collects information from you when you register on our website or forum, email us, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form or download or install our software.

When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or credit card information.

  * GlassWire Installation Process

When installing or uninstalling GlassWire’s desktop software, our installer will contact GlassWire.com so we can know how many installs of our software have occurred. This contact sends your software version number, OS version, and if you’ve installed GlassWire before, along with an anonymized partial IP address and anonymized machine ID to us estimate how many users we have. Our mobile software does not contact GlassWire.com at all because we use the installation stats provided by the Google Play Android store. When uninstalling GlassWire for Windows you have the option to visit our uninstall web page where you have the option to submit the reason that you uninstalled our software.

After installing GlassWire for the PC you may notice on GlassWire's graph that GlassWire itself contacts GlassWire.com around once per day. GlassWire for the desktop checks for software updates that may contain important security fixes and also updates its suspicious host list. GlassWire can block itself from accessing the Internet however if you do so then you may not know about important software updates and your suspicious host list may no longer be up to date. Please note our suspicious host list does not come from GlassWire users. We can never see your network data. Our mobile software does not contact GlassWire.com at all because it has no suspicious host lists and it updates through the Google Play Android store. GlassWire does not collect any personal information through this daily update/software check.

  * GlassWire Activation Codes (Desktop Only)

GlassWire Basic, Pro, Elite and other paid desktop products sometimes use activation codes to unlock GlassWire's paid features. When activating GlassWire Basic, Pro, or Elite the GlassWire software will contact GlassWire.com and check to see if the activation code should be authenticated or not and to see how many machines are using that code. GlassWire keeps an anonymized record of your activation code as related to your computer so it can see how many devices are using your code.
