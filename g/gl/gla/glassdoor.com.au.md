# Privacy Policy | Glassdoor.com.au

This Privacy Policy was last updated in January 2012.

Glassdoor, Inc. (“ **Glassdoor** ”, “ **we** ”, or “ **us** ”) takes the privacy and protection of personal information very seriously. By visiting the Site, registering as a Member or using the Services, you acknowledge and accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalised terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Glassdoor Terms of Use, which can be found at [http://www.glassdoor.com.au/about/terms.htm](https://web.archive.org/about/terms.htm) and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference. This Privacy Policy describes Glassdoor's practices with respect to the Personal Information that we collect when you use the Services. 

“ **Personal Information** ” is information that is personally identifiable like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. We collect and use Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy from the Users of our Services. 

BY USING THE SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. 

YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.

## **Information We Collect**

We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:

  * Our Member registration process to create an Account requires you to provide us with your e-mail address and password of your choice. Furthermore, you have to provide either an employer review or salary report to become a Member. 
  * When you use our Facebook App or connect to our Site using your Facebook Account, you will be asked to share information, as more specifically described, about Facebook below.
