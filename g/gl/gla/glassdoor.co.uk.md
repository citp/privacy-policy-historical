**Revised October 3, 2017**. 

This Privacy and Cookie Policy is effective immediately for unregistered users and users registering accounts on or after the revision date. For users who registered accounts before the revision date, it will be come effective thirty (30) days after the revision date. 

We, Glassdoor, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices at 100 Shoreline Highway, Mill Valley California, USA as the data controller ("Glassdoor"), explain in this Privacy and Cookie Policy how we collect, process and/or use information that we receive via our websites, emails, and mobile applications (collectively "Glassdoor Website") that link to this Privacy and Cookie Policy, as amended from time to time. This Privacy Policy describes how Glassdoor collects, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information. 

This Privacy and Cookie Policy applies only to information we collect, process and use through the Glassdoor Website. This Privacy and Cookie Policy does not apply to information that we collect through other channels, such as information that we collect offline, from other websites or from emails you send us. 

##  Information We Collect and How We Use It

 **Personal Information that You Provide Us Actively**

When you fill out registration forms, submit your CV or provide us with other personal information actively, you will know what personal information we are collecting, processing and/ or using because you are actively submitting it. Because we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with personal information also may change, but here are some examples of situations in which you may decide to provide personal information to us:

  * Creating an account; 
  * Signing up for email alerts; 
  * Completing a form related to one of our products or services; 
  * Uploading a CV;
  * Contacting us for technical support or customer service. 



Depending on how you interact with Glassdoor, the personal information we collect from you may vary. For example, to create an account we may ask only for an email address and password. In other circumstances, such as when you complete a form related to a particular service offering, we may ask you to provide other information, which may include your name, phone number, and/or postal address. On a voluntary basis, you may also decide us to provide us more sensitive information such as your National Insurance number; driver's licence or other government-issued identification number, or payment information, including a bank account, credit or debit card number.You should not include sensitive data (such as National Insurance number, driver's licence number, credit or debit card numbers, etc.) in any CV you upload to the Glassdoor Website or submit it in any other scenarios, except where we specifically prompt you to provide such information.

If you connect to the Glassdoor Website using Facebook, Google+, or another social networking site (each a "Social Networking Site"), we will receive information that you authorise the Social Networking Site to share with us, including information about your friends and connections on that Social Networking Site. Any information that we collect from your Social Networking Site account may depend on the privacy settings you have set with the Social Networking Site, so please consult the Social Networking Site's privacy and data practices. 

Employers with Free Employer Accounts may provide us with work email addresses of their employees for us to use to send an email encouraging those employees to leave candid reviews of the employer on the Glassdoor Website. Email addresses obtained in this manner are used solely for the purposes authorized by the employer. 

**Information We Collect by Automated Means**

When you use the Glassdoor Website, your device is automatically providing information to us so we can respond and customise our response to you. The type of information we collect by automated means may vary, but generally includes technical information about your computer, such as your IP address or other device identifier, the type of device you use, and operating system version. The information we collect also may include usage information and statistics about your interaction with the Glassdoor Website. That information may include the URLs of our web pages that you visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, location data (if you have enabled that collection on your mobile device), and other information about how you used the Glassdoor Website. 

Automated means of data collection include the following: 

**_Web Browser_**. When you visit a Glassdoor website, your browser automatically sends us your Internet protocol ("IP") address so that the web pages you request can be sent to your computer or device. We use your IP address to determine additional information, such as whether the computer or device has ever been used to visit the Glassdoor Website before, which Glassdoor features were used the most often, and how much time was spent on a page. 

**_Web Beacons and Log Files_**. We use "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking pixels, and clear GIFs) on our websites and those of certain of our job posting clients. These web beacons allow us and third parties to collect information such as the IP address of the device, the URL of the web page, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and any additional information in cookies that may have been set by the third party. The information is typically collected in log files, which generally track traffic on our websites. We use this information for a variety of purposes, including the management of our online advertising by establishing which ads brought users to our websites. The information also is used for analytical purposes and to manage technical issues that may arise. 

**_Cookies._** We also collect, process and/or use information using cookies or similar technologies to help us identify you when you visit the Glassdoor Website and we may share cookies with third-party advertisers or advertising networks to serve you relevant, targeted ads unless you’ve opted out from such sharing. For more information on cookies and similar tracking mechanisms, how we use them, and how you can control them, please see the section entitled Cookie Policy and Ad Choices. 

**_Mobile Device ID._** If you access or use the Glassdoor Website on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, including tablets, we collect mobile device identifiers and IP Address. We may create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number. We may collect the device type and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, geolocation or email address. 

**_Mobile Analytics._** We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application. 

**_Location Data._** If you access the Glassdoor Website using a mobile device, we may collect your physical location if you have enabled this feature. Even if you are not using a mobile device, information about your general location may be discernable from your device's IP address or the URLs we receive. 

**Recipients/Information Third Parties Collect from Glassdoor**

Via "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking pixels, and clear GIFs) on our website, third parties can collect information such as the IP address of the device, the URL of the web page, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and any additional information in cookies that may have been set by the third party. 

Our partners also use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. 

If you respond to ads posted by third parties or submit information to third parties via the Glassdoor Website, such third parties receive information about you subject to their privacy policies. 

If you come to the Glassdoor Website through social media sites, from other websites or with devices that enable third parties to collect information from or about you, such third parties receive information about you subject to their privacy policies. 

**Do Not Track Signals**

We do not currently respond to 'do not track' signals and similar settings or mechanisms. When you use the Glassdoor Website, we try to provide a customised experience. 

**How We Use Information/Purposes**

We may use the information we collect: 

  * to provide you with personalised content, services offered by Glassdoor as well as promotional content and services; 
  * to moderate and display the employer reviews, interview reviews, salary reports and other content you have submitted for the benefit of our other users; 
  * to customise and improve the features, performance, and support of the site; 
  * to show you relevant information, if you connect to the Glassdoor Website through a Social Networking Site, from your Social Networking Site friends and connections, and to allow you to share job and profile information with them; 
  * to provide relevant advertising, including interest-based advertising from us and third parties, which may mean that we share non-personally identifiable information, such as your job title, to third-party advertisers; 
  * to provide recruiting services to employers; 
  * for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement; 
  * to communicate with you regarding our services; 
  * to analyse use of the Glassdoor Website and improve the Glassdoor Website; 
  * to create aggregate and statistical data that does not identify you individually and that we can commercialise; 
  * for other purposes that you separately authorise as you interact with Glassdoor. 



When you set up an individual user account on Glassdoor, we create a member profile (a "Profile") for you that will include personal information you provide. We will update your Profile with information we extract from resumes you upload on Glassdoor. You may permit us to share information in your Profile with prospective employer, recruiters and others. Subject to visibility settings that you control, subscribers to services we may introduce will be able to view information in your Profile. Because your anonymity on Glassdoor is important, your Profile does not include or link to information about the reviews or salary information you submit to Glassdoor. 

##  How We Share Information

We do not disclose your individual account or usage data to third parties, except as follows: 

  * With your consent; 
  * We use affiliated and unaffiliated service providers all over the world that help us deliver our service and run our business subject to strict confidentiality agreements. (for example, if you enter credit card information on the Glassdoor Website in connection with a purchase, in most cases that information is sent directly from your browser to the third-party service provider we use to manage credit card processing and we do not store it on our servers. The service provider is not permitted to use the information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf. The exceptions to the foregoing are limited to employers and individuals which purchase select products from Glassdoor by entering credit card information into the Glassdoor Website. That information is stored in our secure accounting software separate from all of our other user and customer data); These companies are authorised to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us; 
  * We share aggregated usage statistics that cannot be used to identify you individually; 
  * We will disclose data if we believe in good faith such disclosure is necessary (1) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants or legal process served on us; (2) to enforce our Glassdoor Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (4) as we otherwise deem necessary to protect and defend the rights or property of us, the users of our services, or third parties. Our general procedure with respect to civil subpoenas or properly-served demands requesting user data is to require a court order, binding on Glassdoor before we release such information; 
  * In a reorganisation or sale of our company or assets, your data may be transferred, subject to the acquirer accepting the commitments made in this Privacy and Cookie Policy and compliance with applicable law; 
  * If you apply for a particular job through the Glassdoor Website, we will disclose your personal information to the employer to whom you apply and any vendors they are working with to process your application; 
  * We may invite you to include your CV or other information in more generally available formats and then offer third-parties the right to view this information, subject to visibility settings you control; 
  * We may share certain information that does not identify you personally, but which is unique to your use of the Glassdoor Website, such as job titles that you have entered at the time of registration or on your profile. When we share such information, we do not link job titles with your name when we provide this information to others, such as advertisers, recruiters or employers. 



##  Cookie Policy and Ad Choices

This Cookie policy describes how Glassdoor, Inc. ("we", "our", "us") uses Cookies and similar technologies. For more information on our general data privacy practices, please see our Privacy Policy. 

**Cookies**

Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone, or other device when you first visit a page. We use cookies, web beacons, locally shared objects (sometimes called "flash cookies"), mobile identifiers and similar technologies ("Cookies") to help us recognise you on the Glassdoor Website, enhance your user experience, understand Glassdoor usage, and show you relevant advertising. By visiting the Glassdoor Website, you consent to their placement in your browser in accordance with this [Privacy and Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/about/privacy.htm). Cookies may also be set by other websites or services that run content on the page you're visiting. To learn more about our partners and their use of Cookies, [click here](https://web.archive.org/about/privacy-third-party.htm). After you register on the Glassdoor Website, we may connect information we collect from the Cookies set by us and our partners with other information received from you. The provision of your data via Cookies is voluntary. The use of Cookies may include the collection, processing and/or use of personal data in countries outside the European Economic Area that do not provide the same level of data protection as in your country. 

**What types of Cookies do we use?**

We use two types of Cookies on the Glassdoor Website: "session cookies" and "persistent cookies." Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that remain on your device until you leave the Glassdoor Website. A persistent Cookie remains on your device for much longer until you manually delete it (how long the Cookie remains will depend on the duration or "lifetime" of the specific Cookie and your browser settings). 

**What are Cookies used for?**

Cookies may transmit information about you and your use of the Glassdoor Website, such as your browser type, search preferences, job titles, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. With the exception of an identifier Cookie that we associate with registered accounts to prevent fraud by Glassdoor members, Cookies may link to certain unique information such as the job titles that you entered at time of registration or on your profile, but this is not linked to your name. 

We use Cookies for things like: 

Authentication

We use Cookies to help us determine whether or not you've signed in to the Glassdoor Website and to keep you signed in during visits as you access different pages. 

Security

We use Cookies to enable and support security features, prevent fraud, and protect your data from unauthorised access. 

Preferences and Features

We use Cookies to enable features, help us provide you with personalised content such as showing you your recent search activity. 

Advertising

We use Cookies to deliver, evaluate and improve advertising, such as by using information about you to provide relevant advertising both on and off the Glassdoor Website. Our partners may use a cookie to determine whether you've already been shown an advert or how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interacted with an advert. 

Analytics and Performance

We use Cookies to analyse how our visitors use the Glassdoor Website and to monitor site performance. These Cookies help us to identify and fix errors, understand and improve services, research and test out different features, and monitor how our visitors reach our sites. 

**Ad Choices and Managing Cookies**

Glassdoor works with several third parties to provide you with personalised, interest-based advertising. We may target adverts to you on and off the Glassdoor Website using: 

  * Cookies (both on and off the Glassdoor Website) and IP address; 
  * Mobile device location information, to the extent you have enabled location tracking on your device; 
  * Member-provided profile information; 
  * Your use of the Glassdoor Website (for example, your Glassdoor Website search history); and 
  * Information from third-parties (including advertising partners, publishers, and data aggregators) which we use to help deliver relevant adverts to you. 



We work with third parties, such as Google Analytics, to provide analytics services that may use the Cookies set on your device to measure the performance of advertising and track traffic to Glassdoor generally. In addition, we have implemented [Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357?hl=en), which categorises cookie information so that we and third-party service providers can better deliver advertisements that are relevant and useful to you on the Glassdoor Website and various websites across the internet. You may opt out of tracking by Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting services by visiting [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads) or by downloading the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 

You may be able to opt out of other third-party advertiser and ad network placement of Cookies or targeted advertising by visiting the following links: [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/); [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/); [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) (for users in the EU); [The Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada ](http://youradchoices.ca/choices) (for users in Canada); or you can follow opt-out instructions of the individual advertising networks, analytics providers and other advertising third parties we work with listed [here](https://web.archive.org/about/privacy-third-party.htm). You will continue to receive generic adverts by companies not listed with these opt-out tools. 

You may also be able to disable placement of some (but not all) Cookies by setting your browser to decline cookies, though this may worsen your user experience. Additionally you can also control, manage and/or delete cookies via your browser settings. A useful resource for information about deleting and controlling cookies can be found at [AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/). 

If you enable location data for the mobile version of the Glassdoor Website (including any version installed as a native application), we may use your location data to serve you geo-targeted adverts and offers for businesses or employers that are local to you. In such instances, we do not share your location with the advertiser or advertising network; rather, we provide the advertiser or advertising network with a means to push adverts through to users located in certain areas or postal codes. You may disable location services at any time in your device privacy settings or the Glassdoor native app settings. 

_Please note_ : if adverts or other features on the Glassdoor Website are provided by third parties, those parties also may set and use their own Cookies that are subject to those third parties' privacy notices and policies. Glassdoor does not have access to, or control over, these Cookies.

**Security Safeguards**

 **Security**. We employ physical, electronic, and managerial measures to safeguard the information we collect online. However, no company can fully eliminate security risks, so we cannot make guarantees about any part of our services. You are responsible for keeping your username and password secret. Once you have registered with us, we will never ask you for your password. Please create a unique password for your Glassdoor account and do not use it for any other web services or applications.

**Tips For A Responsible Job Search**. We actively monitor the Glassdoor Website for job postings that violate our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about/terms.htm) . If we detect fraudulent activity, we remove the job posting from the Glassdoor Website. However, fraudulent job postings can sometimes appear and we urge you to exercise caution in your job search. Please consider the following tips when conducting your search: 

  * Do not send money to a prospective employer. 
  * Do not give out personal or financial account information to a new employer via email. 
  * Do not cash checks or transfer funds for your employer. 
  * Beware of job postings that ask you to send your CV to a free email service address (e.g gmail, yahoo, etc). 
  * Do not include sensitive information like your National Insurance number in your CV. 
  * Beware of job listings with spelling errors and bad grammar. 
  * If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
  * Do your homework. Be sure to research any job opportunity that interests you. 



If you see a suspicious job posting, please contact us [here](http://help.glassdoor.com/ContactUs/en_US). If you think you have been the victim of fraud, immediately report the fraud to your local police and contact Glassdoor. [](http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx)
