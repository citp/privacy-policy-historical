### Advertising Cookies

We also set cookies for advertising or remarketing purposes: enabling us to serve more tailored advertising as well as helping improve our site for users.

Google uses cookies like NID and SID to help customize advertising on Google properties, like Google Search. Such cookies remember your most recent searches, your previous interactions with our website, search results, and engagement with our advertising. This helps us to show you customized advertising on Google.

We also use cookies for advertising we serve across the web. The main advertising cookie on non-Google sites is called ‘id’ and it is stored in browsers under the domain doubleclick.net. With the DoubleClick product, a cookie called ‘__gadvertising’ may be set on the domain of the site you are visiting. Unlike cookies that are set on Google's own domains, this cookie can't be read by Google when you're on other sites. It serves purposes such as measuring interactions with the advertising on that domain and preventing the same advertising from being shown to you too many times.

Some of our other cookies may be used to measure conversion events as well. For example, DoubleClick and Google Analytics cookies may also be used for this purpose.

We also use the MediaMath provider to deliver advertising on behalf of the University. Details of their policies and opt-out mechanisms can be found at [www.mediamath.com/privacy-policy](http://www.mediamath.com/privacy-policy/)
