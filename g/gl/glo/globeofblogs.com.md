# Globe of Blogs ::: Privacy Policy

### Random Weblog

[Art Of Noh, The](http://www.noh.ro/weblog/) ::: A weblog about computer security, antivirus protection and malware protection by Costin Raiu, Kaspersky Labs.  


## Statement of Policy

All the information we collect from you will be used for determining your weblog's placement in the Globe of Blogs weblog directory. You have the choice of providing (or not providing) much of the information that we collect. Your degree of anonymity is up to you. Your email address and IP address will be kept confidential and are used for administrative purposes only.  


## Information Collection & Use

The following is a summary of all the information we collect from users and how it is used.  


### Author Information

  1. **IP address (automatic)** Your IP address is collected when you submit a weblog to prevent abuse of the weblog submission system. It and a system timestamp are collected when your submission is approved for the queue to ensure that a given IP is not spamming the database through the use of a bot or automatic submission script. It is not used in any of the Globe of Blogs database searches.  


  2. **Email address (required)** Your email address is collected so that we can contact you if there is a problem with your submission. There is no mailing list associated with Globe of Blogs, nor is there any third-party affiliation. Your email address is never given away or sold to a third-party.  


If Globe of Blogs should at some point in the future become a directory where users can update their weblog entries themselves, your email address will be used to email you an identification code or password to enable you to log in and "claim" each of your weblog(s). This would, if enabled, be a one-time mailing.  


  3. **Author name or alias (required)** When submitting a weblog, we ask that you provide your name or nickname to enable people to find you in the database more easily. You do not need to state your real name, or your full name.

  4. **City (optional)** This can be a city, a general geographical description, or can be left blank. It is used to allow webloggers to find others blogging in their area.  


  5. **State, province, or country (required)** We ask for your location to help other webloggers find weblogs with similar cultural and lingual backgrounds. If you do not wish for your location to be disclosed, you can choose **Other > No place, unknown, or undetermined**.  


  6. **Date of birth (optional)** We optionally ask for your birthday so that we can list weblogs by date of birth (age) and also by birthday. You may leave this blank. If you enter a birthdate, our software will check to make sure that you are over the age of 13 as of the date of entry.  


  7. **Gender (optional)** This data is used for advanced searches on the demographic characteristics of webloggers. There is the option of not specifying a gender.  





### Weblog Information

  1. **Submission type (required)** This is used to help determine whether we need to delete an existing weblog entry from the Globe of Blogs database.  


  2. **Notes (optional)** We are always trying to improve the Globe of Blogs database and the category schema. This information can also be used to help find previous incarnations of a weblog where the title has changed and the author wishes to update the weblog.  


  3. **Weblog title (required)** This is used for labeling and sorting your weblog's listing in the weblog directory.  


  4. **Weblog description (optional)** This is used for a keyword/context search of listed weblogs, and can serve as a short advertisement for your weblog in the Random Weblog listing.  


  5. **Adult content** This may be used as a filter so that those who do not wish to view adult weblogs (above PG-13 content) can avoid them in search results. This functionality has not yet been implemented.  


  6. **Weblog topics (optional)** Weblog topics are used to categorize weblogs and assist webloggers and researchers in finding relevant topical weblogs. Weblog topics are chosen by the authors of the weblogs themselves. Globe of Blogs makes no guarantee of accuracy in the classification of weblogs and relies on the honesty of author's submissions to keep category weblog contents accurate.
