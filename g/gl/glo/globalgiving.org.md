# Privacy Policy - GlobalGiving

GlobalGiving values you and respects your privacy. We collect information to support our relationship with you, improve our services, and communicate about promotions or special services. GlobalGiving recognizes that we must maintain and use information responsibly. 

This policy describes what personal information we collect and how we use it. You can always find the most current version of our privacy policy at [www.globalgiving.org/aboutus/privacypol.html](https://web.archive.org/aboutus/privacypol.html). 

**If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact us at[privacy@globalgiving.com](mailto:privacy@globalgiving.com).**

####  Information Collection 

We collect information when you visit our website, create an account, edit your account information, donate to a project, or send or use a gift card. Some of this information is technical information that is automatically logged by our servers. 

####  Creating a globalgiving.org Account 

When you create an account on our website, we collect basic information about you - your name and email address. You can choose to provide additional information, such as your mailing address, a photo, favorite projects, etc., if you create a profile or create a GlobalGiving gift registry. 

####  Making a Donation 

When you make an online donation on globalgiving.org, we collect personal information such as your name, billing address, and email address, if you have not already provided these details. We collect information about your donation, including the project you are donating to and the amount of your donation. You may choose to provide the email address of friends that you ask us to notify about your use of the globalgiving.org website. We also collect (but do not retain) credit card numbers which are processed by a third-party payment vendor subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. If you use PayPal or a similar service, their use of your information is based on their terms of service and policies, not ours, so we encourage you to review those policies carefully. 

####  Gift Cards 

When you give a GlobalGiving Gift Card, we collect payment and contact information about you, as well as the name, email address, and mailing address of your recipient. You may create a personal message to the recipient, which is stored on our servers. Except in the limited circumstances described below, we do not read or use your personal messages. 

If you are the recipient of a GlobalGiving Gift Card, we collect information from you when you redeem the Card to make a donation. Please note that we may share this information with the individual or entity who gave you the gift card. 

####  Donations in Honor/Memory of Someone 

When you make a donation in honor or memory of a loved one, we collect payment and contact information about you, as well as the name, email address, and mailing address of the recipient. You may create a personal message to the recipient, which is stored on our servers. Except in the limited circumstances described below, we do not read or use your personal messages. 

####  Contests, Promotions, and Surveys 

Periodically, GlobalGiving may invite you to participate in contests, take advantage of special promotions, and complete online surveys. If you have created a GlobalGiving account or profile, information we collect from these contests, promotions, and surveys may be associated with you personally. 

####  Creating a Fundraiser or Registry 

When you create a fundraiser or registry on GlobalGiving, we collect information about projects you propose or wish to support. GlobalGiving notifies the project leader when a fundraiser or registry is established for their project, but does not share your personal information with the project leader or the project. Remember, however, that anything you post on your fundraiser site will be seen by visitors to the site. 

If you donate to a registry, fundraiser, or giving group, then we will also share your name and the date and amount of your donation with the person who created the registry, fundraiser, or group. 

####  Technical Information 

Like most websites, our servers automatically collect certain technical information when you visit our site, including your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your visit, the referring URL, and, if you have visited our Site before, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We also collect information about your activities on the site, such as the pages you access. 

In order to collect this information, the site places a cookie on your hard drive. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. 

In addition, we use a tool called "Google Analytics" to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, what other sites they used prior to coming to this site, and Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests). We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using [Google Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). 

####  Use of Information 

GlobalGiving uses the personal information that you provide, and the technical information logged by our servers to process your donations, to: 

  * deliver the notifications described above; 
  * notify your friends and family about the project if you ask us to; 
  * improve your experience (such as remembering your name, the items in your Giving Cart, or your preferences); 
  * contact you regarding your donation(s) and other aspects of the service; 
  * operate the site and our business; and 
  * compile aggregate statistics that allow us to understand how visitors use our site, and to make improvements in design and content to better serve you.



####  Disclosure of Personal Information 

We will share your personal information with our agents, representatives, service providers and contractors in order to process your donations, offer you services in connection with our website, communicate news and information about GlobalGiving, provide customer service, enhance and improve customers' donor experiences, and complete financial transactions. These service providers are authorized to use your information only to the extent necessary to serve these purposes, or as otherwise authorized by this policy. 

Unless you ask us not to, we also share your personal information when you make a donation: 

  * When you donate to a registry, fundraiser, or giving group, we share your name and the date and amount of your donation with the person who created the fundraiser, registry, or group.
  * When you make a donation that is part of a campaign sponsored by your employer, and/or when your employer is being asked to match your donation, we will share your name, email address and the amount of you donation with your employer.
  * When you donate to a project, we share your name and contact information and the amount of your donation with the project leader.
  * Each time you make a donation, however, we will give you the opportunity to tell us not to share your personal information in the ways described above (except in the case of employer matched donations).



If GlobalGiving merges with, or becomes an affiliate of another organization, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

Aside from the purposes described above, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent, unless: (1) we need to respond to a subpoena, court order or legal process; (2) an emergency situation requires disclosure before your permission can be obtained (e.g., situations involving potential threats to personal safety), or; (3) we determine that disclosure is needed to protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of another person.

We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our other partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

####  Information about Children Under 13 

GlobalGiving.org is a general audience website, and does not collect information about a visitor's age. We do, from time to time, partner with other organizations to educate children about philanthropy in general and our work in particular. In those cases, we do not collect personal information from a visitor on pages specifically designed for children. 

####  Viewing and Updating Your Information on globalgiving.org 

You can access your account information at any time by going to the My Account page. You can make changes to your information and update your account at any time. 

You can also unsubscribe from GlobalGiving communications at any time by sending an unsubscribe email as described at the bottom of every GlobalGiving communications, or by updating your subscriptions on the My Account page. 

When you create an account or profile on globalgiving.org, you can decide whether to make some or all of that information public or private. You can change your choices at any time using the My Profile page. Please note, however, that your preferences do not affect the disclosures to project leaders, or fundraisers, or giving group leaders. So, for example, if you make a donation to a fundraiser, then we will display your name and date of your donation on the fundraiser regardless of your settings. Likewise, if you contribute to a project, we will share your name and contact information with the project leader. In each case we will give you the opportunity to tell us not to disclose your personal information with the project leader, or publish it on the web site or in our annual report.

####  Links to Other Websites 

Other websites, including those of our partners (links to which appear on globalgiving.org), have their own privacy policies. When you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the GlobalGiving privacy policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal information. 

You should take additional steps to safeguard your personal information online. To learn more about how to protect yourself, visit the [Federal Trade Commission website](http://www.ftc.gov/). 

####  Security 

GlobalGiving understands the importance of keeping your information secure and confidential. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to help safeguard your information. When you make a donation, information about your credit card, Paypal account, or bank is transmitted using SSL. 

####  Privacy Policy Updates 

Our privacy policy is regularly reviewed to make sure we continue to serve the privacy interests of our customers. If our information practices change materially, we will post the policy changes on the privacy page of this website to notify you of these changes. Please check our website periodically for more information on how we use the data we collect.
