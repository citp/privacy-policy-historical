**1\. What does “personal data” mean?**  
“Personal data” (sometimes referred to as “personal information” or “personally identifiable information”) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.  If we are not (or at least not without a disproportionate amount of time and effort) able to relate a direct link to you personally, this information is not personal data.  

**2\. Our data protection and data privacy principles**  
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.  Our websites are principally designed in a way that limits the collection and processing of personal data to a minimum. Personal data we collect are stored on specially protected servers. Access is restricted to a limited number of authorized persons who need the access in order to administer our websites or ensure their proper functionality, especially with regard to technical support.

In certain cases, we are required to transfer personal data to third parties due to applicable legal requirements. This may be the case when there is reason to suspect a crime or misuse of our website.

**3\. What personal data do we collect?**  
The personal data we collect depends on your use of our website.  Depending upon your use, we may collect and process your name, address, telephone number, email address, the name of your employer, your phone number, and your IP address.  Website usage information is collected using cookies.

**4\. How do we collect and process personal data?**  
We take your privacy seriously and use your personal data to administer your account, deliver content, provide free trials, and inform you of product offerings.  More specific details of how our websites work and how we process personal data are provided below:

Marketing: We collect IP addresses of those who visit our website for marketing purposes.  We are not able to link IP addresses to a specific individual unless the individual has filled out a form on our site and provided additional personal data. From time to time, if you have consented and provided us your e-mail address, we will e-mail you our newsletters, free product updates, and other special offers. This subscription is voluntary and you are free to withdraw your consent at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link you will find in every email.  

Web services:  You will need to provide information to register for a “Globalscape Account.” The account allows you to access various Globalscape services online, such as managing your licenses or requesting support. Those services may be governed by a separate privacy statement which may differ from this policy.

Premium Content:  In order to access various content elements, such as Whitepapers or Videos, to reach dedicated marketing material, or to register for events, we will ask for your name, email address, and we may also request your address, the name of your employer, and your phone number. 

Free trials:  If you want to test our products, we will also ask for your name and email address, and we may also request your address, the name of your employer, and your phone number. This information will be used for sending out the activation code and to remind you of the end of the trial period. 

Contact Forms:  If you want to contact us by using our contact and support forms, you will be asked to provide your contact information (entry fields marked “*”), which we will exclusively process or use as necessary to get in contact with you and provide you with the information you desire. You are free to provide additional information (through the data fields not marked “*”), which we will process in line with all applicable data protection requirements. This data will be forwarded to the Globalscape or Globalscape Partner office in your country. The Globalscape or Globalscape Partner will use the data in order to get in contact with you.

User Surveys: Your participation in surveys is optional, although we may require your participation as a condition to a trial use of our software. We may ask you to describe the ways in which you and your company manage your IT resources or your experience with our software or Web sites. We may also ask you for demographic information such as age, gender, or areas of interest. We use this information to help us improve our software, plan marketing initiatives, and develop new products that may interest you. We may tie this information to other personal information that we have about you.

Purchase: In addition to obtaining your name and other personal information, we will identify and log your browser type when you purchase our software online. We use this information to help us detect piracy of our software.

Web Survey:  Your Web Survey results are collected and transmitted to you by our server.  The results and certain statistics regarding the results are stored on our server for the purpose of facilitating the reporting features of the software.  We do not view the results or statistics or share that information with any person.

Website Protection:  We may collect and retain IP addresses of those who visit our site in order to protect and defend our site against misuse.

**5\. Retention of personal data**  
The personal data we obtain for you will be retained up to indefinitely. 

**6\. Sharing of personal data**  
For the provision of certain services, we may make use of external service providers, such as Software as a Service (SaaS) providers. To the extent those external service providers need to have access to personal data, we ensure that any such access is limited to the extent necessary for the provision of the respective service. Furthermore, such external service providers of course have to submit themselves to comply with all applicable data protection regulations.
