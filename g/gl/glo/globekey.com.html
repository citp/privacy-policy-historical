            <p>This privacy statement is applicable to Globekey Guest Reservations. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Globekey does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals
              except when such individuals specifically provide such information on
              a voluntary basis. For example, such personally identifiable information
              may be gathered from a contest or sweepstakes registration, user enrollment,
              affiliate enrollment, hotel enrollment, and Vacation Auction sign-up.
              Personally identifiable information on individual users will not be sold
              or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval
              of the user at the time of collection. At such points of collection, the
              user will have the opportunity to indicate whether he or she would like
              to "opt out" of receiving auction notices, promotional and/or marketing
              information about other products, services and offerings from Globekey
              and/or any third parties. Further, notwithstanding any opt out of promotional
              information by the user, Globekey reserves the right to contact a hotel
              member, affiliate member, or user regarding account status, changes to
              the subscriber agreement and other matters relevant to the underlying
              service and/or the information collected.<br>
              <br>
              Globekey reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior
              and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various
              areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well
              as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising
              banners. Globekey will provide only aggregated data from these analyses
              to third parties. Also, users should be aware that Globekey will not use
              users' collected names and information for third party use unless the
              user has provided permission for such use. Globekey is not responsible
              for any actions or policies of such third parties and users should check
              the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing personally
              identifiable information. <br>
              <br>
              Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose
              personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address)
              on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas of the Globekey sites, that
              information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the user's
              communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties
              and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties.
              Such activities are beyond the control of Globekey .</p>
            <p>Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may
              be automatically collected through the standard operation of Globekey's
              Internet servers or through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small
              text files a web site can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate the
              user's ongoing access to and use of the site and allow a site to track
              usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements
              and targeted advertising. Cookies are not programs that come onto a user's
              system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique
              number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. Users
              should be aware that Globekey cannot control the use of cookies or the
              resulting information by affiliates, advertisers or third parties hosting
              data for Globekey. If a user does not want information collected through
              the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that
              allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should
              note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features
              (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the Globekey Site.
            </p>
            <p>Upon request, Globekey will allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional
              contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, Globekey will use reasonable
              efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously
              submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities
              will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's
              request, Globekey will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally
              delete the user and his or her personal information from its database;
              however, it may be impossible to delete a user's entry without some residual
              information because of backups and records of deletions. </p>
                  <p>The foregoing policies are effective as of January 1st, 2001. Globekey
              reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users
              of the existence of a new privacy statement. This statement and the policies
                   outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual
                   or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party. </p>
