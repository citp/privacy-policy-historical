            <p>This privacy statement is applicable to Globekey Guest Reservations. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Globekey does not collect personally identifiable information about 
              individuals except when such individuals specifically provide such 
              information on a voluntary basis. For example, such personally identifiable 
              information may be gathered from a contest or sweepstakes registration, 
              user enrollment, affiliate enrollment, hotel enrollment, and Vacation 
              Auction sign-up. Personally identifiable information on individual 
              users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated 
              third parties without the approval of the user at the time of collection. 
              At such points of collection, the user will have the opportunity 
              to indicate whether he or she would like to "opt out" of receiving 
              auction notices, promotional and/or marketing information about 
              other products, services and offerings from Globekey and/or any 
              third parties.Further, notwithstanding any opt out of promotional 
              information by the user, Globekey reserves the right to contact 
              a hotel member, affiliate member, or user regarding account status, 
              changes to the subscriber agreement and other matters relevant to 
              the underlying service and/or the information collected.<br>
              <br>
              Globekey reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user 
              behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and 
              use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of 
              such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed 
              to or clicked on their advertising banners. Globekey will provide 
              only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties. Also, 
              users should be aware that Globekey will not use users' collected 
              names and information for third party use unless the user has provided 
              permission for such use. Globekey is not responsible for any actions 
              or policies of such third parties and users should check the applicable 
              privacy policy of such party when providing personally identifiable 
              information. <br>
              <br>
              Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose 
              personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) 
              on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas of the Globekey sites, 
              that information, along with any substantive information disclosed 
              in the user's communication, can be collected and correlated and 
              used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from 
              other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control 
              of Globekey .</p>
            <p>Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data 
              may be automatically collected through the standard operation of 
              Globekey's Internet servers or through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" 
              are small text files a web site can use to recognize repeat users, 
              facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site and 
              allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data 
              that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising. Cookies 
              are not programs that come onto a user's system and damage files. 
              Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user 
              that has no meaning outside the assigning site. Users should be 
              aware that Globekey cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting 
              information by affiliates, advertisers or third parties hosting 
              data for Globekey. If a user does not want information collected 
              through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most 
              browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; 
              however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide 
              the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) 
              available on the Globekey Site. </p>
            <p>Upon request, Globekey will allow any user to "opt out" of further 
              promotional contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, Globekey 
              will use reasonable efforts to allow users to update/correct personal 
              information previously submitted which the user states is erroneous 
              to the extent such activities will not compromise privacy or security 
              interests. Also, upon a user's request, Globekey will use commercially 
              reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user and his or her 
              personal information from its database; however, it may be impossible 
              to delete a user's entry without some residual information because 
              of backups and records of deletions. </p>
            <p>The foregoing policies are effective as of January 1st, 2001. Globekey 
              reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying 
              users of the existence of a new privacy statement. This statement 
              and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not 
              create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of 
              any party.</p>
