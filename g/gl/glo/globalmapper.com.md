# Blue Marble Geographics Privacy Policy

For this reason, Blue Marble Geographics will operate by the following principles. You agree to this Privacy Policy when you access or use the Blue Marble Geographics website ("the Site"). This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.

## Use of Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that a website saves to your computer or mobile device to store information that you provide about yourself or to store your preferences. Blue Marble Geographics may use cookies to maintain information about your activity on the Site.

## GDPR

Blue Marble Geographics takes your personal privacy very seriously. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 is a regulation in European Union law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union. It addresses the export of personal data outside the EU. This effort has come in to effect in May of 2018. In reviewing how to comply with this regulation for our European customers we decided to enact this as a policy for all of our customers worldwide. To that effect we will clarify that we are asking for your consent when obtaining personal information, we commit to a notification of a data breach event within 72 hours, and we will provide you with the "right to be forgotten" by Blue Marble. This web page is a first step in providing those tools. We will continue to expand our capabilities and flexibility in this process where reasonably possible over the course of the next year. There are certain scenarios with orders, invoicing and purchasing that will require further review so if you have any questions on how we will comply feel free to contact us.

Please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/about-us/contact-us.php) if you have any questions.
