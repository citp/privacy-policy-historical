# Privacy policy | CARE

### CARE International UK is committed to protecting your privacy online.

We may collect and process data about you, some of which is capable of identifying you as a particular individual. This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or you provide to us, will be processed by us.

For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”), the data controller is CARE International UK of 9th Floor, 89 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7TP, United Kingdom.

### 1\. What personally identifiable information does CARE International UK collect about you?

We may collect and process the following information about you:

  * information you provide when filling in forms on the website such as your name, email address and address
  * records of correspondence with you
  * details of any transactions you carry out through our site such as donations to our work



Like many other websites CARE International UK uses **cookies** and anonymous identifiers in order to provide you with a better, more personal web experience. A cookie is a file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer and which enables the website to recognise you. Cookies cannot in themselves be used to identify you. An anonymous identifier is a random string of characters that is used for the same purposes as a cookie on platforms, including certain mobile devices, where cookie technology is not available.

If you do not wish to receive cookies you can easily modify your web browser to refuse cookies, or to notify you when you receive a new cookie. However, should you choose to refuse cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of the website such as interactive features.

We use **Google Analytics** to track non-identifying, anonymous website usage statistics, such as pages visited and referring websites, for the purposes of improving our websites; **Google Advertiser Features** to collect non-identifying, anonymous information for interest-based online advertising; and **Google Demographic and Interest Reports** to collect non-identifying, anonymous demographic data (such as age, gender and interest group) for reporting on general website visitor trends. We also use  **KISSmetrics** to collect non-identifying, anonymised data for the purpose of measuring website repeat visitors and website effectiveness.

For more information on Google Analytics please see [www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/index.html](http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/index.html). For more information on KISSmetrics please see [www.kissmetrics.com](http://www.kissmetrics.com/) 

We will never pass any information to Google:

  * that Google could use or recognise as personally-identifiable information; or
  * that permanently identifies a particular device (such as a mobile phone's unique device identifier if such an identifier cannot be reset).



For more information about cookies and for instructions on how to stop cookies being installed on your computer, please see [www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/guides/about-cookies](http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/guides/about-cookies).

### 3\. Does CARE share your information?

Except with your consent, we will only share your personally identifiable information as set out in this privacy policy.

Certain pages on the website indicate that information you submit will not remain with CARE alone. Information submitted on the donation pages, for example, and as stated on that page, will be processed by our partner company that is providing the secure transactions.

We may disclose your information to third parties in order to comply with any legal obligations, or to protect the property and other rights of CARE including disclosing information for the purposes of protection against fraudulent activities.

We may need to share your information with our service providers, associated organisations and agents for administration and fundraising purposes. We will do this securely and only to companies we instruct to act on our behalf.

### 4\. How does CARE store your information?

When we collect data from you we take reasonably necessary steps to ensure that it is stored securely on our systems and treated in accordance with this privacy policy.

Any payment transactions will be via WorldPay, Stripe and/or PayPal. We do not store credit card details nor do we share customer details with any third parties.

The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any data transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.

### 5\. What are your rights?

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you before collection of data if we intend to use it for such purposes or if we intend to disclose it for such purposes to third parties acting on our behalf such as our service providers, associated organisations and agents for administration and fundraising purposes.

### 6\. Can you update, correct, or delete your personally identifiable information?

CARE maintains high standards of accuracy in keeping your identifying information up to date. If you change email address or know that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or out of date, please contact us.

Pursuant to the Act, you have the right to make a written request to access the information held about you. We reserve the right to impose a small administration charge for fulfilling any request for details on the information we hold about you.

### 7\. Is there anything else you should know?

This website is intended primarily for use by adults. While we welcome users under the age of 18, CARE is not interested in collecting any personal information for users under the age of 18 and recommends that parents and/or guardians do not post, or permit others to post, any personally identifiable information with respect to persons under the age of 18.

### 8\. Will this privacy policy change?

CARE may update or modify this privacy policy from time to time. Such changes will be posted on this page and, where appropriate and possible, notified to you via email. Please be sure to check this page periodically for changes.
