To do this, your status must be set so that your profile remains visible.

We will use your data, including the information you enter into your Profile page, to determine whether you may be a suitable Candidate for any of our Employers, to advise you on current suitable opportunities that we may make available for you in your search for employment, and to allow you to attend the online Employment Events we organise.

You will have choices on your dashboard (<https://www.globalcareersfair.com/login/>) to set the content of our communications to you. Note that you will not be able to opt out of receiving communications from us regarding security and legal updates.
