1.2 Information you post in public areas of the site or placed in the searchable CV database will be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world, including those in countries that might not have legislation that guarantees adequate protection of personal information as defined by your country of residence. By providing your personal information to the Platform, you acknowledge that you consent to your information being used as described here. While Terra Firma takes measures to safeguard your information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use by third parties, GCF does not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of the Platform.
