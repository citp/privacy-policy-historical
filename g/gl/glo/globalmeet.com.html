      <p>Premiere Global Services, Inc. and our subsidiaries (collectively, "Premiere Global Services") recognize and respect the importance of protecting your privacy. To that end, we have adopted the principles set forth in this privacy policy (the "Policy") to govern our use and disclosure of your personal information. While it is impossible to guarantee that such information is or will be completely safe from unauthorized access or use, the following Policy is intended to inform you of the steps we take to protect the information you choose to provide to us. We recommend that you carefully review this Policy before providing us with your personal information.</p>
      <h5>Scope</h5>
      <p>This Policy applies to all of the services and Web sites offered by Premiere Global Services (collectively, the “Site”) and to all personal information that we directly collect or receive from you, whether manually or digitally processed. It does not apply to information our customers collect or receive from you. While we take commercially reasonable measures to protect all personal information in our control or possession, we cannot guarantee or enforce the privacy policies of our customers. For this reason, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of our individual customers' Web Sites before disclosing any personal information to or through them.</p>
      <h5>Information Collection</h5>
      <p>We may collect personal information from you on the Site, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) to facilitate the delivery of services; (b) to provide you information you request, to give you a customized interactive experience; (c) to measure interest in various services; (d) to inform you about new services and features; and (e) to help us develop new services and features that meet your needs. The information we request may include personally identifiable information such as your name, billing and shipping address, telephone number, email address or credit card information. It is solely your choice whether or not you provide this personally identifiable information. However, should you choose not to provide the information, we may be unable to process an order, fulfill a service or display certain content on the Site. We do not sell or rent personal information, including personally identifiable information, to unrelated third parties.</p>
      <p>When you browse the Site, you may do so anonymously as personal information is not collected during browsing. There is a technology called "cookies," which can be used to provide you with tailored information. We may use cookies to provide you with better service. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences for a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. We treat any personal information that may be contained in cookies with the same level of protection as other personal information you provide to us.</p>
      <h5>Information Disclosure</h5>
      <p>We disclose personal information provided to us in limited circumstances. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) to the extent required by law or to respond to judicial process or a good faith belief that such action is necessary under law or to comply with legal process served on us; (b) to protect the security and integrity of the Site and our services; (c) to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of others; (d) to take precautions against liability; (e) to respond to claims that submitted information violates the rights or interests of third parties; (f) to correct technical problems and malfunctions in how the Site operates or processes visitors' information; (g) in connection with a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of one or more of our businesses; (h) to provide to our customers pursuant to your request in furtherance of ensuring that you do not receive further communications from our customers or from us; or (i) pursuant to our customers' specific direction in connection with a service we are providing on behalf of our customers.</p>

      <h5>Security</h5>
      <p>We utilize reasonable and appropriate protections to ensure that personal information in our care is not misused or accessed without authorization. Personal information is stored on our own platforms or on the platforms of our agents/contractors, with access restricted to those employees or contractors who have a need for such access to perform a legitimate business function relating to the services or for maintenance, internal security or related issues. Moreover, we generate audit logs that record all access and use of personal information stored in our databases. Any contractor whom we retain to provide services for us and who will have access to personal information must generally agree to abide by the terms of this Policy.</p>
