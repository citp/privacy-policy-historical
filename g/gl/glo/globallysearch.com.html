    <h3>Which information we may collect on our Users?</h3>
    We may collect two types of data and information from our Users:

            The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information (<b>“Non-personal
                Information”</b>). <b>We are not aware of the identity of the User from which we have collected
                the Non-personal Information.</b> Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information
            which is available to us while Users are using the Site. Non-personal Information which is

    Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.
