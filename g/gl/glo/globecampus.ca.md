## The Globe and Mail Inc. ("Globe")

**_Most recently amended March 13, 2012._**

### _Scope And Application Of The Globe Privacy Code:_

The scope and application of the Globe Privacy Code are as follows: 

The Globe Privacy Code applies to Personal Information about Globe Employees and non-employee Persons who interact with Globe that is collected, used or disclosed by Globe.

  * Employees in this context includes past and present employees and independent contractors of Globe.
  * Non-employee Persons in this context includes Individuals who are viewers, readers, subscribers, advertisers, contest participants, job applicants, Internet users who are exposed to the media content of Globe or a Globe Company and about whom Globe collects Personal Information.



The Globe Privacy Code applies to the management of Personal Information in any form whether oral, electronic or written. Globe reserves the right to amend this Globe Privacy Code from time to time.

The application of the Globe Privacy Code is subject to the requirements or provisions of any applicable legislation, regulations or agreements (such as collective agreements), or the order of any court or other lawful authority.

_**Exclusions from privacy protection:**_ The Globe Privacy Code does not impose any limits on the collection, use or disclosure of the following information by a Globe Company: a) information that is publicly available, such as a Person's name, address, telephone number and electronic address, when listed in a directory or made available through directory assistance; b) business-contact information, such as the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization; c) information collected, used or disclosed in the course of journalistic, literary or artistic activities; or d) aggregate information that cannot be associated with a specific person, such as demographic statistics about Globe customers, or number of visitors and average time spent on a website.

#### _Purposes for Collection of Personal Information:_

Globe has collected and collects Personal Information for the following purposes: a) to establish and maintain responsible commercial relations with Individuals and to provide ongoing service; b) to understand Individual needs; c) to develop, enhance, market or provide products and services; d) to manage and develop its business and operations, including personnel and employment matters; and e) to meet legal or regulatory requirements, including to protect or defend a legal interest, and in connection with an actual or possible Globe corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation with another entity, or an actual or possible sale of all or a substantial portion of the assets of Globe, provided that the Personal Information disclosed continues to be used by the entity acquiring the information either for evaluation of the possible transaction, or, on completion of any such transaction, for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy.

As examples of the above:

  1. Globe may from time to time use a Person's Personal Information to contact the Person about changes, enhancements or similar notices related to Globe products and services;
  2. if a Person indicated that he/she was interested in receiving offers or information from Globe or certain of our selected sponsors or advertisers, Globe may send the Person materials about products and services that Globe feels may be of interest to the Person; and
  3. if a Person enters a contest or other promotion offered on a Globe website, Globe may, under the rules of the promotion, use the Person's name and certain other information to administer the promotion, such as contacting, announcing and promoting the winners of the promotion.



#### _Obtaining Consent:_

Globe will make a reasonable effort to make sure Persons understand how their Personal Information will be used by Globe. Globe will obtain consent from Persons before or when it collects or uses the Personal Information. Globe will not attempt to deceive Persons into giving consent.

A Person's consent can be express, implied, or given through an authorized representative. A Person can withdraw consent at any time, with certain exceptions noted herein. Globe, however, may collect, use or disclose Personal Information without the Person's knowledge or consent in exceptional circumstances where such collection, use or disclosure is permitted or as required by law.

_Note_ : If any Person at any time has any questions or concerns about Globe's privacy practices, the Person can either:

  1. write to Customer Service - Privacy, The Globe and Mail, 444 Front St. West, Toronto, ON, M5V 2S9; or
  2. provide information to Globe [ by sending an email with your inquiry (click here)](mailto:escalations@globeandmail.com?subject=Privacy%20Inquiry).



#### _Refusing or withdrawing Consent:_

Subject to legal and contractual requirements, a Person can refuse to consent to Globe's collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information about the Person, or a Person may withdraw the Person's consent to Globe's further collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information at any time in the future by giving Globe reasonable notice, unless: i) the consent relates to certain information required for credit approval which a Person applies for or accepts, ii) the consent is otherwise required by law or iii) the use or disclosure is permitted by law or is related to the legal or regulatory requirements described herein. If a Person refuses or withdraws the Person's consent, Globe may not be able to provide the Person or continue to provide the Person with some products, services or information which may be of value to the Person.

#### _Internet Aspects:_

Personal Information may be collected by Globe or third-party service providers on Globe's behalf. Although information collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below often does not constitute Personal Information (and to the extent that such is the case, then the obligations under the Globe Privacy Code do not extend to such information), Globe provides the details below about Internet aspects of Globe Companies Services for the purposes of disclosure about Globe Companies Services.

_Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)_  
When the user's web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This address is called the computer's "IP address." For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user logs on.

Globe Companies may use the user's IP Address to:

  * facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the user's or Globe Company's technical team.
  * display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and advertising based on the user's geographic area, demographic profile and site session behaviour.
  * estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.



_Cookies_  
A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to the user's web browser from a website's computers and is stored on the user's computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to a user's computer.

Globe Companies may use cookies to:

  * improve the operation and performance of the Globe Companies Services and to make Globe Companies Services easier and more convenient to use. For example, cookies help Globe Companies provide more personalized services by recalling user preferences on subsequent visits (e.g. language preference). Cookies also allow Globe Companies to save passwords and preferences for a user so that the user will not have to re-enter them on the next visit to a Globe Companies Site;
  * measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to Globe Companies Services and advertisements (e.g. number of users, average time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information helps Globe Companies to better understand when to update, change or offer new services and provides Globe Companies with details as to the performance of Third Party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to Globe Companies' current and prospective sponsors, advertisers and business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in such reports;
  * display advertisements. Globe Companies and Third Party advertising providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on Globe Companies Sites. Anonymous data based on cookies and user IP Addresses may be used to deliver advertisements that are likely to be of interest to the applicable users ("Interest-based Advertising"). In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers are delivered to users (in conjunction with Globe Companies Services) by such Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising providers on their behalf, and not by Globe Companies; as such, the Third-party advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Globe Privacy Code, and users should consult the privacy policies of such Third Party advertisers.



Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers, the user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the user has received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. The user should understand that while Globe Companies do not require a user to use cookies, certain Globe Companies Services will not function properly if a user sets his/her browser to not accept cookies.

_Web Beacons_  
Certain Globe Companies Services may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow Globe Companies to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access Personal Information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about Globe Companies service usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Certain Globe Companies Services web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by Globe Companies' advertising partners to help Globe Companies determine the effectiveness of Globe Companies' Internet advertising campaigns.

_Links To Other Sites And Advertisements_  
A Globe Companies Service may contain links to other websites and services. While Globe Companies try to link only to sites and services that share Globe Companies' high standards and respect for privacy, a user should understand that Globe Companies are not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites. This Globe Privacy Code applies only to the Globe Companies Services related to this Globe Privacy Code.

The majority of the advertisements which are displayed in connection with Globe Companies Services are served through one or more reputable Third Party advertisement-serving companies which deliver the advertisements to users in conjunction with Globe Companies Services. For more information about what information is collected and how information is used by a major Third Party advertising provider [click here](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/).

_Additional Information_  
Globe Companies automatically collect certain information about the user's computer hardware and software. This information may include: browser type, operating system type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by Globe Companies to operate the service, to maintain the quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Globe Companies Sites.

Certain Globe Companies Services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If a user registers for or uses such services, both Globe Companies and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.

"The Globe may from time to time engage outside suppliers, including technology providers." 

Globe may also collect, use or disclose Personal Information without knowledge or consent if seeking the consent of the Person might defeat the purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law.

9.2 In certain situations, Globe may not be able to provide access to all of the Personal Information that they hold about a Person. For example, Globe may not provide access to information if doing so would likely reveal Personal Information about a Third Party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another person. Also, Globe may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information, if the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege, if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law, or if the information was collected as part of journalistic, literary or artistic activities. If access to Personal Information cannot be provided, Globe shall provide the reasons for denying access upon request.

9.3 Upon request, Globe shall provide an account of the use and disclosure of Personal Information and, where reasonably possible, shall state the source of the information. In providing an account of disclosure, Globe shall provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed Personal Information about the individual when it is not possible to provide an actual list.

9.4 In order to safeguard Personal Information, an individual or employee may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit Globe to account for the existence, use and disclosure of Personal Information and to authorize access to the individual's file. Any such information shall be used only for this purpose.

9.5 Globe shall promptly correct or complete any Personal Information found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any unresolved differences as to accuracy or completeness shall be noted in the Person's file.
