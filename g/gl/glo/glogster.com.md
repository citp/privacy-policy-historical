Glogster takes your privacy seriously. Please take the time to read and understand this policy so that you can understand how we use your personal information. Your use of Glogster (“the Site”), along with disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use. If you make use of the Site, register with the Site, request information or submit information in any way to or through the Site, you agree to these terms. As we update and expand our services, this policy may change, so please review it from time to time. 

Go to top

* * *

The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform users of the Site as to what information we collect and how and why we use such information. Through the Site, users may enter personal identifying information (“PII”) about themselves. This policy explains our online information collection and use practices and the choices you can make about the way we use and share such information. 

Go to top

* * *

This policy applies to all PII that we collect and maintain about our users, including any contact information (e.g., name, address, email) or identifying information (e.g. date of birth, gender, country) that we may obtain in connection with providing services. 

When the Site collects PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting Registration PII to us in order to register as a Glogster user. The Site may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in Glogster activities like contests and surveys, because you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to Glogster for review. 

We also may collect certain non-personal information (i.e. generic information that does not identify you personally) when you visit any of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows ’98 or Mac OS), the IP address you are using to connect to the Site and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or EarthLink). This data is used to manage and improve Glogster, track usage, and for security purposes. 

Glogster users may also choose to provide or store non-PII information in their profiles and/or Glogs, including but not limited to interests, hobbies, lifestyle choices, groups with whom they are affiliated (schools, companies), videos and/or pictures, private messages, bulletins or personal statements (collectively “Profile Information”). The Profile Information in a user’s profile is provided at his or her sole discretion. 

Go to top

* * *

We use your personal information to provide you with products or services that you have requested, to respond to questions or communications, and to get in touch with you when necessary. Except as otherwise set forth on the Site, in addition, we may send to you an e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested in or to ask you to participate in a survey. We do not consider any companies that we engage in partnerships with to be “third parties” for purposes of this policy. Thus, we may also share personal information provided online with companies affiliated with Glogster. Any of these companies may use and further share this information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on personal information to an affiliated company, we require that it protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy and your expressed preferences. 

Go to top

* * *

Glogster users can change their Registration PII and Profile Information at any time and can control how visitors, other users and Glogster communicate with them by controlling their account settings, available within the “Edit Profile” portion of their Glogster profile.

* * *

We will not share with third parties the personal information you provide except (a) if it is for the purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent; (c) as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g. in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another); (d) with other persons, service providers or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal site operations or our business activities (for example, sending out a product or a promotional item that you have requested on the Site); and/or (e) notifying you when we make material changes to one of our subscriber agreements or this policy. Examples of us sharing your personal information for the purposes submitted are if you participate in a third-party survey or request information from a third-party, we may provide the information provided to such third party so that they can send to you directly the information you requested. We will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an “opt-in” or “opt-out” method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail). As stated above, we do not consider any companies that we engage in partnerships with to be “third parties” for purposes of this policy and may also share personal information provided online with companies affiliated with Glogster. Any of these companies may use and further share this information in the same ways we do. However, if we pass on personal information to a family company, we require that it protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. 

Additionally, with your consent, we may share the personal information you provide online with companies not affiliated with us (i.e. third party companies) who are interested in marketing their products or services to you or in asking you questions, both online and offline. We will seek to obtain your consent either by an “opt-in” or “opt-out” method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail). Companies with whom we might share your personal information may include consumer products, telecom, financial, military, market research, entertainment, and educational services companies and their third party service providers. 

If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online. In this instance, any changes or amendments to your personal information must be given directly to each company who communicates with you as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will not be exchanged between us and non-affiliated companies. 

If we do share personal information with a non-affiliated company, to the extent practical, we require that they protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. We cannot, however, guarantee how these non-affiliated companies will use your personal information.

* * *

Personal information collected via the Site will generally be governed by the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information was gathered. We will not retroactively make material changes to the way we use PII collected under previous versions of this Privacy Policy without obtaining your consent.

We sometimes use the non-personal information that we collect to improve the design and content of the Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how the Site is used, as well as to offer you products, programs or services. Sometimes we share aggregate information with others, including affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies.

If you would prefer not to receive marketing or promotional e-mails from us that may relate, for example, to new services or offerings, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the unsubscribe mechanism in an email. 

Following your opt-out, please be aware that we, or our affiliates, may continue to contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes, including, but not limited to, follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, any services, features or functions you have affirmatively enrolled in or registered to use, any promotions or sweepstakes you have participated in or have entered, or other transactions you have undertaken on the Site.

As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as “Clickstream Data,” can be collected and stored by a web site’s server. Clickstream Data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site. We may use Clickstream Data as a form of non-personal information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors.

Please remember that any information that is disclosed in chat rooms, forums, message boards, and other community areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use.

We believe we have in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect online. Whenever personal information is passed on to non-affiliated companies, to the extent practical, we require that they also have in place the appropriate safeguards.
