# Privacy Notice | Global Witness

This is the privacy notice for www.globalwitness.org (Site) and any other sites and services operated by us.  The Site and services are operated by Global Witness (we, us and our).   


This notice describes how and why Global Witness uses your personal information, how we protect your privacy and your rights regarding this information.

We have updated this notice to take account of changes in legislation and to give a clear explanation about how Global Witness collects and uses your personal information.

We are committed to protecting your privacy online whilst providing a personalised and valuable experience. Collecting personal information is important so that we can meet the expectations and needs of our supporters and partners.  It is also a legal requirement for some of the things Global Witness does such as processing donations. We take care to ensure that we use your personal data in accordance with applicable laws. 

The legal basis for Global Witness to process your personal information process depends upon the circumstances in which we collect and use this data. In most cases our processing of your personal information will fall into one of the following categories:

  *  **Consent:** where you have agreed that your personal data may be used for a particular purpose or purposes such as email updates about GW’s work
  *  **Contractual necessity:** where the processing of your personal information is necessary to carry out the performance of a contract with you
  *  **Legal obligation:** where the processing of your personal information is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation such as auditing of donations
  *  **Legitimate interests:** in relying on this exemption we will determine how to process your data in a way that fits with Global Witness’s legitimate interests and yet is proportionate in relation to any privacy issues

## Applications to vacancies

If you apply to a vacancy, either for employment, volunteering or an internship,, we use information necessary for us to process your application and assess your suitability (such as employment status, previous experience, unspent criminal convictions).

Global Witness collects a range of information about you in relation to recruitment. This includes: 

  * your name, address and contact details, including email address and telephone number

We may collect this information in a variety of ways. For example, application forms, CVs or resumes, obtained from your passport or other identity documents provided by you, or collected through interviews or other forms of assessment. 

Your information may be shared internally for the purposes of the recruitment process. This includes members of the HR and recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process, where it is necessary for the performance of their roles.

Equality and diversity personal data is for independent monitoring purposes only.

We will inform you prior to seeking your personal data from third parties, such as references supplied by former employers. 

Data will be stored securely on your application record and on other IT systems (including email).

If your application for employment is unsuccessful, the organisation will hold your data on file for 6 (six) months after the end of the relevant recruitment process. 

If your application for employment is successful, personal data gathered during the recruitment process will be transferred to your Human Resources file (electronic and paper based) and retained during your employment.

## Information sharing

We do not sell your details to anyone. We do not make cold telephone calls to members of the public and we do not purchase information in order to do so.  

We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to the Site in order to describe our services to prospective partners and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes.

We may disclose your personal information to external providers of the services we offer through the Site, processing donations, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other tasks, from time to time.  Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.

We may disclose your personal information if required or permitted to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to prevent fraud or cyber crime or to protect the Site or the rights, property or personal safety of any person.

## Child safety

Protecting the safety of children when they use the internet is very important to us.  We recommend that children receive permission from their parent or guardian before gaining access to the Site or sending personal information to us or anyone else online.

The Site may, from time to time, contain links to external sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites.

## Donations processing

Donations made via the Site are made through one of our payment gateway providers, GoCardless or Stripe (as will be made clear at the point of donation). You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to either GoCardless or Stripe which operate a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment.  Information which you supply to either GoCardless or Stripe is not within our control and is subject to GoCardless or Stripe's own privacy policy and terms (as applicable) and which are available on the applicable site.

## Security

We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users.  We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control.  Our security measures and privacy policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal information.  Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.

You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure.  We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Site whilst it is in transit over the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.

It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.

## Storage of your information

Information that you submit via the Site is sent to and stored on secure servers. It will only be stored for as long as we legitimately need it or as required by the law.  

Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see Information sharing), which may be situated outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and may be processed by staff or service providers operating outside the EEA.  We take steps to ensure that any data transfers outside the EEA are compliant with relevant data protection legislation and that your personal information is protected by appropriate security measures.
