### GLOBAL CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE INSTITUTE LIMITED 

The Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute Limited (Global CCS Institute) (ABN 136 814 465) is an Australian registered company limited by guarantee. The Global CCS Institute, in performing its functions, is an organisation for the purposes of the Australian Privacy Act 1988. This statement is issued in accordance with National Privacy Principle 5 in Schedule 3 of that Act. 

Global CCS Institute collects and records certain personal information relating to:

• Global CCS Institute’s founding members and collaborating participants  
• recipients of publicity material  
• contact officers and specified personnel involved in Global CCS Institute projects  
• interested stakeholders  
• members of the Board of Management and the International Advisory Committee  
• Global CCS Institute employees

The Global CCS Institute collects only such information as it requires to perform its functions which are set out in the Global CCS Institute [constitution](https://web.archive.org/web/20100509223228id_/http%3A//www.globalccsinstitute.com/downloads/The%20Global%20CCS%20Institute%20Constitution.pdf).

The information collected is used in the dissemination of information, facilitating and administering projects and managing employees. 

The Global CCS Institute will never disclose personal information to third parties unless consent is obtained from affected individuals or unless the disclosure is compelled by law, for example, by means of a subpoena.

An individual whose personal information is recorded on a Global CCS Institute database may request access to the information. There is no charge for such a request but the Global CCS Institute may charge a reasonable fee for the work involved in locating, copying and providing access to the information. Access requests must be supported by proof of identity and may be made:

• by telephone: +61 2 6175 5300  
• by email: [info@globalccsinstitute.com](mailto:info@globalccsinstitute.com)  
• by mail: GPO Box 828, Canberra ACT 2601, Australia

Reasonable requests by an individual for amendment or annotation of their record will be considered and accommodated as far as possible.

The Global CCS Institute will transfer personal information outside Australia only if the destination has privacy laws similar to those in Australia or, failing that, where arrangements are made in the particular case to protect the personal information disclosed.

An individual who considers that their privacy may have been interfered with by the Global CCS Institute should in the first instance contact the Global CCS Institute Privacy Contact Officer by telephone on 1800 0 GCCSI to attempt to resolve the problem. If this does not produce a satisfactory outcome, the individual can contact the Federal Privacy Commissioner by telephone on 1300 363 992, or by e-mail at [privacy@privacy.gov.au](mailto:privacy@privacy.gov.au).
