You can visit our web and WAP sites without disclosing any personally identifiable information about yourself. If you do submit personal information by ordering products, or services, for example, you can be assured that we will use your personal information only to support your continuing relationship with Warid. We have provided this Privacy Policy Statement to help you understand how we collect, use and protect your information when you visit our web and WAP sites and when you generally use our products and services.

**Personal Information Collection**

We endeavor to collect and use your personal information only with your knowledge and consent and typically when you order and subsequently use products and services, make customer enquiries, register for information or other services, request product information, submit a job application or when you respond to communications from us (such as questionnaires or surveys). The type of personal information we may collect could include, for example, your name and postal address, date of birth, gender, telephone and fax numbers, email address, and credit/debit card information; lifestyle and other information collected on registration or through surveys. If you choose to provide us with personal information it will be used in support of the intended purposes stated at the time at which it was collected, and subject to any preferences indicated by you.   
 

**Non-personally identifying information**

We may also collect non-personally identifying information about your visit to our web, WAP and other similar sites based on your browsing (click-stream) activities. This information may include the pages you browse and products and services viewed or ordered for example. This helps us to better manage and develop our sites, to provide you with a more enjoyable, customized service and experience in the future, and to help us develop and deliver better products and services tailored to your individual interests and needs.   
 

**How will we use your information?**

We may use your information for a number of purposes which includes: processing your orders and managing and administering your account; delivering any services, products or information requested by you; responding to complaints or account enquiries; administering debt recoveries; verifying your identity when required (you may lose your password or security information for example, and we may then need to ask you for other 'identifiable' information to protect your data from unauthorized access).

We may also tell you about the products and services of carefully selected third parties and allow you to receive advertising and marketing information from those selected third parties without passing control of your personal information to the third party. For example we may send you information with your bill, or you may simply receive an advertisement on your personal web and WAP page according to any preferences indicated by you and/or according to your interests. This helps us to make you aware of products and services that we may have specially negotiated for our own customers and which may be of individual interest to you.

You acknowledge that by providing data to us, you consent to the processing of your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy Statement. However, you can contact us at anytime to have your details removed from lists used by us for direct marketing purposes, to update your information or to otherwise tell us how you would like to receive information about our and/or third party products and services - the choice is yours. To update your marketing preferences please email [insert email address] and quote your mobile and/or account number in the body of the email and tell us what you want us to do (i.e. 'opt-out Email', 'opt-out SMS' etc or if you have previously objected to receiving information by post for example, but would now like to change your mind and receive information then just say, 'opt-in post' in the subject header of your email).

(i) companies designated as 'Warid Affiliates' or 'Associates of Warid' for the purposes and subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement; and
