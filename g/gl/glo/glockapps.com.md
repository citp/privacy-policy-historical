# √ Privacy Policies ® G-Lock Apps

Thank you for visiting GLockApps official website located at [glockapps.com](https://glockapps.com/).

We at GlockApps (“GlockApps”, “Service”, “We”, “Our”, “Us”) know that our users (“You”, “Your”) care about how their personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”, “Data”) is used and shared, and We take Your privacy and security very seriously.

These Privacy Policies disclose our data collection methods, usage and confidentiality policies throughout our site. By visiting or using the GlockApps website, You acknowledge that You accept the practices and policies outlined in these Privacy Policies, and You hereby consent that We will collect, use, and share Your personal information in the following ways.

### 1\. Services We Provide at GlockApps

#### Email and IP Testing

We offer an email testing service (“GlockApps”) that allows us to collect data on Your behalf about the emails that You send. We provide You with the seed email list that enables Us to collect data about Your sender infrastructure and email placement. Such data includes the email address and IP address(es) the message is sent from, date and time of the event, message content, message headers and the details about how the mailbox providers treat the email (e.g., whether they put it in the Inbox or spam folder or block it).

 **Integration with MailChimp**

We integrated GlockApps with MailChimp to provide You with an easy way of testing Your MailChimp email campaigns.

GlockApps will never contact or modify Your existing subscribers or lists You have in MailChimp in any way.

We’ll create a new audience in Your MailChimp account in order to import Our test email addresses, and We’ll display a list of Your existing campaigns. When You choose to run a spam test for one of Your campaigns, We’ll email a copy of that campaign to Our test list.

If You receive the “Your current account plan with MailChimp doesn’t permit the creation of additional audiences (GlockApps seed list)” error message, You’ll have to delete an existing audience in Your MailChimp account to allow GlockApps to upload the seed list or upgrade to a higher plan with MailChimp.

By allowing GlockApps to connect to Your MailChimp account, You give GlockApps permission to perform the following actions:

  * retrieve the contents of Your MailChimp templates and campaigns for the purpose of performing email delivery tests;
  * create a new audience titled “GlockApps seed list”;
  * import GlockApps seed list into the “GlockApps seed list” in your MailChimp account. Note: Since MailChimp charges by subscribers, this may affect Your MailChimp pricing tier.
  * update the “GlockApps seed list” in Your MailChimp account in the event that GlockApps seed list changes.
  * create a new campaign and send it to the “GlockApps seed list” list for the purpose of performing an email delivery test.



GlockApps will ONLY contact subscribers in the “GlockApps seed list” list. Other lists and other subscribers in Your MailChimp account will NOT be contacted or modified in any way.

#### Bounce Email Tracking

We offer a bounce tracking tool that allows Us to collect data on Your behalf about bounce emails that You receive. We provide You with the proxy email address that enables Us to collect bounce emails on Your behalf and provide You with the bounce email analytics data. Such data includes the recipient’s email address, Bounce Type, ISP, Bounce Email Subject, Message-ID, From Email, From Domain, Report Date, Diagnostic Code, and Custom Fields if defined by You.

 **Integration with Amazon SES, Mailgun, SendGrid and SparkPost**

We integrated GlockApps with Amazon SES, Mailgun, SendGrid and SparkPost for bounce email tracking and analytics.

GlockApps will never contact or modify Your existing subscribers or lists you have in Amazon SES, Mailgun, SendGrid and SparkPost in any way.

We’ll set the GlockApps webhooks for bounce email tracking and We’ll collect only the bounce email data as stated above.

You acknowledge and agree that it is at Your discretion as to what data is collected in connection with the use of GlockApps, and therefore, You are solely responsible for the collection and use of any such data, ensuring that such collection and use are in accordance with Your privacy policies and all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation any applicable data protection laws or regulations.

GlockApps operates under the domain https://glockapps.com. All data collected is the property of the customer (“You”) and is just hosted/facilitated by us. GlockApps stores this information securely on behalf of You. This information is only accessible by You.

### 2\. Collection of Information

#### 2.1. What Information Does GlockApps Collect Automatically?

You can visit our site without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Our site does automatically collect information such as Your IP address, browser type, operating system, “cookie” information, and the page You requested for site trends and statistics, but this information does not personally identify You.

To protect the customer resources area from misuse, We actively monitor all logins into the system in addition to recording standard weblogs. We collect login dates and times as well as recording IP addresses on an individual basis. In addition, We record the details on all actions that are taken, also on an individual basis. This allows Us to perform individual analysis of patterns of activity for the purposes of detecting prohibited access and misuse of the resources in the system.

We do not receive or ever store any financial information such as credit card details and none of the information We collect is ever shared with any third parties outside of our immediate e-commerce provider.

The customer area presents a highly individualized facility for managing reports and raw data. In order to provide this facility, We have to record basic (non-financial) information about each user’s choice of purchase as well as recording their usage of the facility, for example, to customize the credits remaining for each user.

When We collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the website), We only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify You personally. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners, but We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify You personally.
