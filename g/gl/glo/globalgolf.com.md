# GlobalGolf.com Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to GlobalGolf.com Inc ("herein referred to as either “GlobalGolf.com,” “GlobalValueCommerce,” “We,” or “Us”). We are committed to respecting your privacy on this site. To fulfill the sales orders submitted by our customers (“our Services”), we will require information (including address and credit card information) regarding our customers (“Users”). We will maintain the confidentiality of information provided in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we will provide notice on this Web site regarding any changes to this policy.

**1\. Use of Information**  
GLOBALGOLF.COM may provide certain demographic information it collects to third parties in connection with its provision of Services to our Users. The dissemination of this information is necessary in order to provide personalized information and promotional offers. Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, our current policy is to refrain from selling, leasing, or otherwise transferring your personally identifiable information, however, this policy does not apply in all cases and this policy may be changed in the future. We describe below some of the situations in which such information may be disclosed. GLOBALGOLF.COM will never provide our promotional affiliates with personally identifiable information which would permit them to communicate with our Users by email unless the User "opts-in" and have not "opted-out", pursuant to our opt-out procedure, from receiving communications. You may have the opportunity to ask us to provide your information to these promotional affiliates. We expect those promotional partners with whom we share information (with consent, as provided herein) to respect the privacy of our Users in the same manner as we do. However, we cannot ensure that they abide by our privacy policies.

The information we collect may also include information you submit about others, including the name, e-mail address or physical address of a gift recipient. We only use information you submit about other people to deliver information, products, or services specifically requested by you or to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our customers.

**2\. Information That Is Personally Identifiable**  
Our registration format requests certain contact information from our Users. We collect information that is personally identifiable through the registration and purchasing process when processing your order. When a User completes an order, the format will require personally identifiable information for each User, including: 

  * Contact information (including name, home address, email address)
  * Unique identifiers ( including credit card numbers)
  * Demographic information (including zip code, telephone area code, age, birth date, gender, income level, etc.)



The information we have obtained through this process may be used by GLOBALGOLF.COM, as well as by providers of related services, in connection with processing your order. We also use contact information from the registration format to send the User information about us and when otherwise necessary. Such information may also be used to assess your satisfaction with and to obtain feedback regarding the Service we provide and to tailor the visitor's experience while visiting our Web site.

We may use the contact information we collect to provide, by means other than email, information or offers which we believe will be of value to Users and we may share contact information with other companies that may want to provide our Users, by means other than email, information regarding additional products and services. We may also use the contact information to send our Users information or offers by email which we believe will be of value to them and we may share email contact information with other companies that may want to provide our Users information regarding additional products and services. Such contact information may be shared based upon the demographic information we collect. Users may opt-out of receiving future communications at any time; see the section below regarding "Opt-out".

Finally, the information we collect will be maintained in a file that we may need to review in a variety of other circumstances, such as enforcing our Terms of Use for Users, analyzing and understanding our customers and their needs, and for the administration and provision of our goods and services.
