<p></p><strong>Personal Information</strong> <br>We may ask you for personal information when you download our software, register for a trial license, purchase a permanent license, or at all of these times. For example, we may ask you for your e-mail address, your name, company name, address, and credit card billing information. 
<p></p>We use your e-mail address to send registration reminders,&nbsp;to notify you of new software releases, updates, special offers, news, and possibly to send investor communications. For your convenience, each announcement contains instructions on how to be removed from all future mailings.
