WHY WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION

Global Cash Card receives and retains information about its customers through many sources. We limit the use and collection of this information to that which is necessary to maintain and administer financial services, provide excellent service, and offer new products and services that may be of benefit to our customers. We gather information about you and your account so we can (a) deliver products and services to meet your needs, (b) know who you are and thereby prevent unauthorized access to your information, (c) design and improve the products we offer, (d) replace a lost card, PIN, or to provide some other form of assistance, and (e) comply with laws and regulations that govern us.

WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We may collect the following types of "non-public personal information" about you:

* Information we receive from you on applications or other forms.
* Information about your transactions with our affiliates or us.
* Information about your transactions with non-affiliated third parties.
Global Cash Card is committed to fully complying with the laws and regulations, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Right to Financial Privacy Act, that have been established to protect the confidentiality of customer information. If we obtain and use information from a third party such as a consumer report, we will notify you. You are entitled to request credit reporting agencies to remove your name from lists supplied to us. Global Cash Card does exchange information about our customers to reputable information reporting agencies, in accordance with standard industry practice, to maximize the accuracy and security of such information and verify the existence and condition of customers' accounts. We do not share specific personal customer information with independent companies for any other purpose without the customer's consent, except when required by law, regulation, or court order, and to third party litigants when required by lawful judicial process or court order.

WHAT INFORMATION WE DISCLOSE

We collect, use and share information about you so that we can provide the highest level of service to you for the products you use. We require companies to which we disclose non-public information about you to maintain its confidentiality.

We may share information we collect to our affiliates (i.e., companies related to us by common control or ownership) that offer financial services or additional products and services. In addition, we may disclose information we collect to companies, both affiliates and non-affiliates that perform marketing or other services on our behalf or to other companies with which we have joint marketing arrangements. We are also permitted under law to disclose non-public personal information about you to affiliates and "non-affiliated third parties" in certain circumstances. For example, we may disclose non-public personal information about you to companies that assist us in servicing your account.

In certain circumstances, in order to comply with government requirements or court orders, we are required to disclose information about you or your transactions. We will do this only when required by law, regulation or court order. We share only the information required.

HOW TO LIMIT SOLICITATIONS

From time to time, we or our affiliates or partners may call or write to tell you about products or services that we think may be of interest to you. You may tell us not to market products or services to you through telemarketing or direct mail marketing and not to provide your information to our affiliates or partners for marketing purposes by submitting a "no solicitation" request. You may, however, continue to receive promotional information in account related notices or other business purpose communications, including electronic announcements.

If you choose not to receive direct mail or telephone solicitations, please write to Customer Service at 7 Corporate Park Drive, Suite 130, Irvine, CA 92606 and request that we do not solicit you through, or provide information about you to financial partners for telemarketing or direct mail marketing.

PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET

We are committed to protecting your privacy online. Our privacy policy applies in its entirety to your Internet and PC transactions.

CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY

Member Personal and Financial Information is private and passed through a highly secured state-of-the-art SSL (Secured Socket Line). Our system is security focused that requires the leading 128-bit SSL certificates and Web sites solutions, Secure Site Services provide you with all of the authentication and encryption power. We restrict access to non-public personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to complete transactions or to provide products and services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your information.

CLOSED OR INACTIVE ACCOUNTS

We will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice even after your account is closed or becomes inactive.

TO CHANGE YOUR ELECTION

If you would like to change a previous decision to limit direct marketing or sharing of nonpublic personal information please call the toll-free number on the back of your Card, or write us at the address listed above.
