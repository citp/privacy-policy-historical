# Privacy Policy – Glossy Belle

At GlossyBelle.com, the privacy of my viewers is very important to me.  In this privacy policy, I will be summarizing the types of personal information that are received, collected, and how they are used on my site.

First and most importantly, I will never share your name, email address, or other personal information to anyone without your direct consent.

### Log Files

Like many other websites, I use log files to assist in gathering broad information to analyze when, where, and how often traffic flows to my site.

These log files include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, platform type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamps, referring/exit pages, and the number of clicks.

None of this information is linked to anything that is personally identifiable.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

Viewers may choose to subscribe to email blog updates by submitting an email address to the email subscription form. I reserve the right to communicate with subscribers regarding information related to this site.  Subscribers may choose to unsubscribe anytime after opting-in by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link which is included in every email.

Again, no personal information will be shared with anyone unless direct permission is given. However, if you still wish to disable cookies, you may do so by modifying your Internet browser’s settings.  You can find the instructions to disable them in your browser’s help section.

### Advertisers

I use external advertising companies and networks to display ads as well as web analytical tools to understand how visitors engage on this site.  These third-party ads and web tools may contain cookies and/or use web beacons to collect information.  As these cookies and/or web beacons are collected by these networks and companies themselves, GlossyBelle.com has no control or access over these cookies.
