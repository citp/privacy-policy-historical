**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT**  
From time to time, ALM may use customer information for new purposes not previously disclosed in this privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes here to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back to our Web site periodically. 

**WHAT INFORMATION DOES ALM GATHER AND/OR TRACK ABOUT YOU?**  
When you register to receive ALM products, whether those products are free (such as the GlobeSt.com Web site) or paid (such as a subscription to a ALM Newsletter or a Magazine purchase), ALM may require that you supply personal information, including, but not limited to, your full name, e-mail address, contact information, and a unique subscriber ID. ALM may also require demographic information (e.g., whether you are a property owner and in what type of real estate sector you work). Customers must also agree to the Terms and Conditions of Use applicable to the product for which they are registering. In some instances, we also collect credit card information to bill subscribers for premium products. 

**ANONYMOUS INFORMATION**  
ALM may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by ALM or shared with third parties. This information does not personally identify you but may be helpful for improving the services we offer. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "cookies," "IP addresses," or other numeric codes used to identify a computer. 

**COOKIES**  
"Cookies" give users a special, random ID that are small text files, which are stored on the hard drive of a user's computer. ALM employs cookies to recognize you and your access privileges for certain locations on the Web site, such as the Practice Centers, as well as to track site usage. Subscribers who do not accept cookies from the Web site cannot access many areas of the Web site. ALM also uses an advertising server developed by a third party, currently DoubleClick, to display ads on the Web site. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (i.e., advertising agencies or advertising clients). ALM does not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain. 

**IP ADDRESSES**  
ALM also logs IP addresses for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. (Your IP address indicates the location of your computer on the Internet.) ALM does not log IP addresses to track your session, nor do we link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. 

**CREDIT CARD INFORMATION**  
If you use a credit card to pay for an ALM product, we may retain your credit card information in order to renew your account in the event you elect to renew your subscription. When we do retain credit card information, we keep it secure and separate from other demographic information you may have given us. We do not share credit card information internally within divisions of ALM. 

**WITH WHOM DOES ALM SHARE THE INFORMATION IT GATHERS AND/OR TRACKS?**  
ALM takes the privacy of its customers seriously. You have the ability to control how we use your personally identifying information by telling us if you wish to opt-out of certain uses of your information, as described in greater detail in the "Opting Out" provision below. 

ALM shares the information it gathers in a compiled format with advertisers and other partners. The compiled format does not include personally identifying information. ALM may, on occasion, choose to share personally identifying information collected about subscribers with select third parties whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. Many of our subscribers find these e-mail promotions valuable, whether they are shopping for merchandise, taking advantage of a special offer, or purchasing unique services. If you prefer not to have your personally-identifying information shared with select third parties, please see the "Opting Out" provision below. Personal information about you as an individual subscriber or registrant may be shared, regardless of your "opt-out" status, in the following instances: 

**COMPLIANCE WITH LAW**  
ALM may release information if it is required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on ALM; and (2) protect and defend the legitimate business interests, rights or property of ALM, its users, advertisers, customers, sponsors, advertisers or affiliates. 

**VENDORS**  
ALM may on occasion use third-party vendors to assist it in performing its business functions, such as mailing statements to subscribers, editing user lists, processing data and payments, and providing customer service. Personal information may be shared with these businesses or individuals to allow them to perform their assigned functions, but is limited to that information needed to perform the assigned function, and may not be used for any other purpose. 

**ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES**  
Should ALM undergo a sales, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation, ALM's accumulated customer information will be treated as an asset and, like other business assets, subject to transfer to or acquisition by a third party.

**ALM STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND BANNER ADVERTISING**  
ALM may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. ALM also uses demographic information to allow advertising banners on the Web site to be targeted to the readers for whom they are most pertinent. This means that readers will see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the user's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. In this statistical analyses and banner advertisement targeting, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form, with no personally identifiable information. 

**DATA SECURITY**

Detailed information about SSL is available from Netscape.

ALM may utilize the contact information you provided at registration, such as your telephone number and e-mail address, to contact you regarding account status, changes to the subscriber agreement, and to confirm registration. 

**SERVICE UPDATES AND E-MAIL PROMOTIONS**  
Using the contact information and e-mail addresses provided at registration, ALM may send promotional messages to its users about services offered by ALM and notify users of new features or changes that may be made to these services. ALM may also elect to send promotional messages on behalf of selected third parties whose products or services we think may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive promotional mail or e-mails from ALM , please see the "Opting Out" provision below.

ALM is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of Web sites to which it may link. This policy applies solely to information collected by ALM . 

**ALM PROVIDER PARTNER PRODUCTS & SERVICES **  
While visiting the Web site, you may decide to purchase a product or service through one of our provider partners whose services are promoted or advertised on the site. If you do so, you will be acting under the guidelines of the third party provider's privacy policy, if it has one. ALM cannot make guarantees or warranties as to the nature of a third party's use of your personal information.
