# GlobalSpec - Privacy Policy

We at GlobalSpec have one primary goal: to help the engineering and technical buyer communities quickly find products and components that meet their specifications. This is a free service that we are proud to be able to offer and which is the largest of its kind. The suppliers on this site contract with GlobalSpec to be here and need to be able to correlate the correspondence they receive from you with your visit to the site in order to measure site effectiveness. For this reason we ask you for user information. We understand the reluctance users on the web have about providing user information (we share the concern) so we have instituted the following PRIVACY POLICY to address the issue: 

> GLOBALSPEC PRIVACY POLICY
> 
>   1. Except as set forth herein, your contact information (name, phone number, and e-mail address) will not be shared with anyone other than the suppliers from whom you have asked for contact information (including, but not limited to, phone/fax, Web site, or email), or product information (including, but not limited to, specifications or RFQs). Strategic partners provide some of the services offered on GlobalSpec. Some of these services require additional registration. When this occurs, GlobalSpec will transfer your registration information to the relevant service provider. You will always have the ability to accept or decline the transfer of that information.
>   2. Profile information (search activity, end-user company information, etc.) may be used to generate aggregate reports and market research. 
>   3. All personal data has been entered solely by respective end-users. 
>   4. GlobalSpec mail communications are only accessible by designated recipients, except that GlobalSpec, Inc personnel involved in maintenance of the web site may have access to email communications.
>   5. You can modify your user information by visiting www.globalspec.com/myglobalspec and clicking on Edit My Profile. 
>   6. You may have your personal information removed from the system by contacting webmaster@globalspec.com. 
>   7. GlobalSpec, Inc will not sell lists of its users and/or contact information to any third party without having first elicited individual permission from included end-users to do so. 
>   8. GlobalSpec may transfer your contact information to a purchaser of the entire business, and/or it may be shared with any companies that merge with GlobalSpec or that GlobalSpec purchases.
