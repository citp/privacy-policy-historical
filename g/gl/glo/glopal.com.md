use appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, collection, use,
disclosure, copying and disposal of your Personal Information.

secure means of communication. Personal Information communicated through the Internet may
be intercepted by other people. We cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information sent
to us through this Site. You accept that you use this Site at your own risk.
