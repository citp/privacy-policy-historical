# Glock Pistols - Glock Pistol | Glock Talk - Privacy Policy

## By registering with GlockTalk.com (“GlockTalk” or “Site”), you signify your assent to our Terms of Use Agreement and Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Agreement”).

## I. Introduction.

Gun Server LLC is the operator of www.glocktalk.com. As part of its business, GlockTalk gathers personally identifiable information on its websites as well as anonymous data regarding the website and your activities on the site. GlockTalk takes its privacy obligations very seriously. Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at [customerservice@glocktalk.com](mailto:customerservice@glocktalk.com). 

## II. Definitions.

As used in this Privacy Policy, “we”, “us”, and “our” refers to GlockTalk, and its affiliated group of companies (including Gun Server, LLC) and the “Site” refers to www.glocktalk.com, its subdomains and any other site on which this Privacy Policy appears. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any offline data collection or practices of GlockTalk.

## III. Jurisdiction.

The Site is operated from servers located in the United States of America. If you are located outside the United States and accessing the Site, please be aware that information you provide on the Site is being transferred to and stored in the United States. The Site’s personal information practices and the terms of this Privacy Policy may or may not comply with foreign law, so if you do not agree with this, please do not use the Site.

## IV. What Information Do We Collect?

When you visit our Site you may provide us with two types of information: (i) personal information (such as your name, birth date, phone number, email address and mailing address) (collectively, “Registration Information”) collected on an individual basis; and (ii) Site use information collected on an anonymous and aggregate basis as you and others browse our Site. Whenever GlockTalk collects personally identifiable about you, it reserves the right to use that information for marketing GlockTalk and its various activities. This is true in both the unpaid and paid sections of the Site. GlockTalk may use the personally identifiable data collected to undertake a variety of marketing activities including, but not limited to, email, direct mail, site personalization, telephone marketing and other digital and traditional methods of advertising and communication. GlockTalk does not sell or “monetize” data to 3rd parties. GlockTalk, however, does and will send marketing messages on behalf of its sponsors and partners. It will do so without giving any of your personally identifiable information to those sponsors and partners for their own use.

## V. Personal Information You Choose to Provide.

**1\. Registration Information.** You will provide us with certain information about yourself, your firm or company, and your practices when you register to be a member of www.glocktalk.com, register for certain services, or register for email newsletters and alerts.

**2\. Email Information.** If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses.

**3\. Site Use Information.** Similar to other commercial websites, GlockTalk utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and server logs to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Site, and the websites visited just before and just after GlockTalk. We, our advertisers, and ad serving companies may also use small technology or pieces of code to determine which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them.

**4\. How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?** Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering and expanding our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at [customerservice@glocktalk.com](mailto:customerservice@glocktalk.com). From time to time GlockTalk will allow its Sponsors or marketing partners to offer Site visitors an opportunity to opt-in” to receive marketing information directly from that Sponsor or marketing partner. In such cases, on the registration page, an “opt-in” question will appear clearly explaining that by checking the box you agree to share your personally identifiable information with that particular Sponsor or marketing partner. If there is not a Sponsor ”opt-in” question on a registration form, GlockTalk will not give any of the data collected to any Sponsor or partner. 

**5\. Disclosure of Personal Information.** We may disclose your personal information if required: (a) by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law or legal process served on us or affiliated parties; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, our site, the users of our site, and/or our affiliated parties; (c) act under circumstances to protect the safety of users of our site, us, or third parties.

**6\. Referral Service.** If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend [email a friend, refer a friend, send to a friend, email a page, invite a friend] about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. GlockTalk stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at [customerservice@glocktalk.com](mailto:customerservice@glocktalk.com) to request that we remove this information from our database. 

**7\. What Are Cookies?** A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies that originate from their sites. We have no access or control over those cookies. 

You can decide if and how your computer will accept cookies by configuring your preferences option within your web browser. To disable this function in your web browser, choose the “help” menu and follow the instructions for deleting cookies and preventing your browser from downloading additional cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you can still browse our Site, but you may be unable to post on the Site or otherwise access certain services and content available on the Site. GlockTalk does not store personal or confidential information in cookies (although our third party advertisers may – and we take no responsibility for their actions).

**8\. How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?** As you browse GlockTalk, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting the Site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our Site and better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.

**9\. Sharing Information with Third Parties.** We may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection with alliances, partnerships or arrangements, we may also provide certain information to third parties if we have determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible third party. For example, some of our partners operate stores or provide services on our site, while others power offerings developed by us for your use. We also use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not limited to, sending email and processing credit card payments. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our partners and other third parties may have access to your personal information for use in connection with business activities. As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution. 

**10\. Widgets.** Our Site includes Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g. displaying the news, opinions, music, etc). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.

**11\. Facebook Connect.** You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

**12\. Blogs/Forums.** Our Site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas becomes public information and you may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. We recommend that you do not post your email address or other personal information in our forums because this information is publicly available for anyone to see and unscrupulous third parties may use this information to form 'spam' lists or may otherwise misuse this information. We are not responsible for the use or misuse of information posted by you in public forums by other users of the Site.

**13\. Notice of New Services and Changes.** Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. As our customer, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by sending us an email request at [customerservice@glocktalk.com](mailto:customerservice@glocktalk.com).

**14\. How Do We Protect Your Information?** The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can contact us at [customerservice@glocktalk.com](mailto:customerservice@glocktalk.com). 

**15\. How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?** You may request access or make corrections to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing [customerservice@glocktalk.com](mailto:customerservice@glocktalk.com). 

**16\. Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personally Identifiable Information.** If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at [customerservice@glocktalk.com](mailto:customerservice@glocktalk.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

**17\. What About Other Web Sites Linked to GlockTalk?** We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Site. 

Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Site to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link on our Site, is subject to that websites own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. 

**18\. Children’s Privacy.** The Site is not intended for or directed to persons less than 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our services to children. If you are under 13 years of age, do not use the Site.

**19\. For Persons Outside the United States.** By consenting to this Privacy Policy, you confirm that your command and knowledge of English is sufficient to understand the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement. You agree that by using the Site, your personal data will be transferred to GlockTalk servers located in the United States in connection with the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. You understand that the laws with respect to the protection of personal data in the United States may be more or less stringent than those in your home jurisdiction.

**20\. Submissions.** Suggestions, materials or other intellectual property sent or transmitted to us via our Site are governed by the separate terms applicable to such materials identified at the time of submission (if any). All such items shall be deemed to be non-confidential, and we shall have no obligation of any kind with respect to such items and shall be free to use and distribute them to others without limitation, including, but not limited to developing and marketing products incorporating them.

**21\. Acceptance of Privacy Policy.** By using our Site, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not submit any personal information to us through our Site.
