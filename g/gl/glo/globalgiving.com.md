If we shared your personal data with others, we will tell them about the correction where possible. If you ask us, and where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your personal data so you can contact them directly.

**Right to restrict processing:** You may ask us to restrict or 'block' the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as where you contest the accuracy of the data or object to us processing it (please read below for information on your right to object). We will tell you before we lift any restriction on processing. If we shared your personal data with others, we will tell them about the restriction where possible. If you ask us, and where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you with whom we shared your personal data so you can contact them directly.

**Right to data portability:** You have the right to obtain your personal data from us that you consented to give us or that was provided to us as necessary in connection with our contract with you.

In addition, when you create an account or profile on our Site, you can decide whether to make some or all of that information public or private. You can change your choices at any time using the My Profile page. Please note, however, that your preferences do not affect the disclosures to project leaders or fundraisers. So, for example, if you make a donation to a fundraiser, then we will display your name and date of your donation on the fundraiser regardless of your profile settings. Likewise, if you contribute to a project, we will share your name and contact information with the project leader. In each case we will give you the opportunity to tell us not to disclose your personal data with the project leader, or publish it on the website or in our annual report. You may ask us to change the anonymous settings on past donations by emailing us at [privacy@globalgiving.org](mailto:privacy@globalgiving.org).

Other websites, including those of our partners (links to which appear on globalgiving.org), have their own privacy policies. When you provide personal data at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the GlobalGiving Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal data.
