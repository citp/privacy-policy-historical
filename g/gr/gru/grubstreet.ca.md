GrubStreet.ca and the web sites it owns value your privacy.

Visitors aren't required to register to use any site owned or operated by GrubStreet.ca nor is personal information about users stored. The term "personal information" means data, such as user name, IP address, browser type and so forth. The sole exception is general information used to determine number and legitimacy of visitors, primarily, but not exclusively, for advertising-related purposes, such as enumerations.

GrubStreet.ca and the web sites it owns or operates don't post content that openly advocates violence, is pornographic or promotes, in an unbalanced way, pharmaceuticals, illegal actions or ethnocentricity, including anti-gay materials. GrubStreet.ca does post reasonably balanced, factual and thoughtful comment or opinion on any topic; we may post fiction, with a sensuous undertone, serious analyses of illegal actions, such as an argument for the legalization of prostitution or a day in the life of a drug dealer.

Adjectives make the difference. Balance, factual, thoughtful, sensuous, serious and analyses make your ideas artful and welcome on GrubStreet.ca. The downside is art is often in the mind of the beholder. Editors make decisions and all editorial decisions are open to balance, factual, thoughtful, sensuous, serious and analytical appeals.
