**Cookies and Pixel Tags**  
A cookie is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer. Cookies enable you to place an order on our web site. They also allow us to enhance and personalize your online shopping experience, so the information you receive is more relevant to you.

For example, we use cookies to: 

  * Remember what items are in your shopping cart
  * Recognize you when you return to our web site
  * Enables faster checkout, if you have created an account at llbean.com
  * Study how our customers navigate through our web site and which products they request in site searches
  * Deliver personalized marketing messages



We also use pixel tags – tiny graphic images – to tell us what parts of our web site you have visited or to measure the effectiveness of any searches you may do on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send you email in a format you can read and let us know when you have opened an email message from us.

We may also contract with other companies who use cookies or other online tools such as pixel tags to measure the performance of a marketing effort on our behalf. We prohibit these companies from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than us.

We also contract with third party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf across the internet. To do this, they will collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other web sites to target advertisements. These targeted advertisements may appear on other sites that you visit. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a cookie or pixel tag – industry standard technology used by most major web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected in this process. 

**How We Use Email**  
When you provide us your email address, we will email you as necessary to process your order, respond to a request or provide customer service. For example, after you place an order, you will receive an email confirmation and, in most cases, an email with package tracking information. Recipients of our email gift cards will receive an email notifying them of the gift and instructing them how to redeem it.

We may also send promotional emails about products, special offers, services or events we believe may be of interest to you. It is our intent to send promotional emails only to those who wish to receive them. We provide instructions on how to unsubscribe in each email and within the [My Account](https://web.archive.org/account/login) section of our web site.
