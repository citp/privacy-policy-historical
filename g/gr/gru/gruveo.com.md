# Privacy Policy for Gruveo Services - Gruveo

## **What Is This Policy?**

This is our data protection and privacy policy that explains who we are, why and how we process personal data and, if you are the subject of any of the personal data concerned, what rights you have and how to get in touch with us if you need to.

This information is provided to explain our online information practices and the choices you have in the way information is collected on our websites at www.gruveo.com, about.gruveo.com and videola.io (“ _Gruveo Websites_ ”) as well as our applications for Android and iOS (“ _Gruveo Apps_ ”) (Gruveo Websites and Gruveo Apps jointly hereinafter referred to as the “ _Gruveo Services_ ”). Unless provided otherwise, the information in this Privacy Policy applies to the latest published versions of the Gruveo Websites and the Gruveo Apps.

## **Who Are We?**

We are **Gruveo, s.r.o.** with its registered seat at Dénešova 71, 040 23 Košice, Slovak republic (“ _Gruveo_ ”). Our contact details are set out at the end of this policy. We are the controller in relation to the personal data processed in accordance with this policy (except where this policy or our contract with you explains otherwise).

Our mission is to enhance and simplify the way people communicate over the Internet.

## **Whose Personal Data Do We Process?**

  * You are a user or a subscriber of Gruveo Services;
  * You are a supplier of ours;
  * You work for a user or a subscriber or a supplier of ours, or for someone who uses Gruveo Services.
  * You are someone (or you work for someone) to whom we want to advertise our Gruveo Services. In this case, we may have obtained your details direct from you (for example, via Gruveo Websites you may send us your email address for the newsletter purposes).



## **What Personal Data Do We Process?**

We may process personal data relating to you that we have acquired from you, or obtained from somewhere else (for example, from your employer).  The personal data relating to you that we process may include the information set out below.

## **Personal Details of Gruveo’s Users and Subscribers**

We may process your personal details pursuant to our “customer class” that you choose at Gruveo Services, including:

  * **Anonymous user  
**You have not created an account and/or log at Gruveo Services and you join only anonymous call rooms as well as call Gruveo handles. We do not collect any personally identifiable information from you if you use Gruveo without creating an account.
  * **Free users registered at Gruveo Services until October 2017  
**You chose to create a Gruveo account until October 25, 2017. You provided us only your email address to prove account ownership. Your email address will never be shared with any third parties.
  * **Paid subscribers  
**You have created our paid Gruveo account. Therefore, we have to process your name, surname, email address, business name (if you are not a natural person), phone number. Please note that we do not process your payment data from credit/debit card.
  * **API users  
**If you have chosen our API user account, we shall process the following data:  
– paying via FastSpring: name, email address, company name, phone number;  
– paying via PayPal: name, company name, email address;  
– paying directly via Gruveo: name, company name, address, VAT number.



Please note that the provision of this personal data is a contractual requirement that will enable us to fulfil the contract concerning your use of Gruveo services and in the event of failure to provide such data you are unable to use certain functions of Gruveo Services.

## **What Personal Data Do We Process when You Use Our Gruveo Services?**

We process the electronic communications data only if it is necessary to achieve the transmission, distribution or exchange of the Internet communication among the users (for example, metadata) and for the duration necessary for that purpose.

We also collect usage statistics for Gruveo users and subscribers, where we collect the following information:

  * Date and time of the call;
  * Subscriber username;
  * Call duration;
  * Whether the call was an incoming or outgoing one;
  * Maximum number of participants achieved in the call.



We do not provide this information to any third party.

## **How D** **o We Process Y** **our IP Address and Logs?**

### **IP Address**

We process your IP address to receive information about in which devices the Gruveo Services are used. The purpose for processing the IP address is to find the devices and the nearest server to connect to. The legal basis for our processing of the IP address is that it is necessary to fulfil the contract concerning your use of Gruveo Services. Without collecting the IP address from you and processing it, we cannot connect you to the nearest server, which is necessary for the provision of Gruveo Services.

All user’s or subscriber’s IP addresses are fully anonymized by masking the last octet of the IP address.

### **Logs**

We collect server logs to monitor the performance and security of Gruveo Services as well as to ensure the proper functioning of the service.

The characteristics of each type of logs we collect are following:

  * Web server access logs on [www.gruveo.com](https://www.gruveo.com/): 
    * Kept for a maximum of 31 days;
    * No user IP addresses are logged.
  * Signaling server logs (connection logs): 
    * Kept for a maximum of 31 days;
    * All user IP addresses in logs are anonymized by masking the last octet of the IP address;
    * Gruveo handles (i.e. usernames) are not logged to lower the possibility of tracing calls made by logged in users to their username.



## **Would You Like to Receive Our Gruveo Connect Newsletter?**

You may choose to sign up to our Gruveo Connect Newsletter by providing your email address for subsequent communication. If you subscribe for our newsletter via the Gruveo Website or Apps, you give us your consent with emailing you with our Gruveo Connect Newsletter.

Your email will never be shared with any third parties and you will receive only the type of content for which you signed up. You can unsubscribe at any time.

Please note that subscribing to the newsletter is not required to use the Gruveo service.

## **How Is Security Ensured at Gruveo’s Services?**

### **General**

All Gruveo calls are encrypted, with one-on-one calls being encrypted end-to-end as per the WebRTC standard. Wherever the users’ firewall configurations permit, one-on-one calls are established directly between the users’ devices. A one-on-one call may get relayed via one of our TURN servers due to restrictive firewalls, but even in that case the TURN server would not be capable of decrypting the call content.

All text messages on Gruveo are relayed in encrypted form via our secure servers.

Moreover, all personal data processed by Gruveo are stored securely and protected by using appropriate technology.

Where you choose your access details for your account at Gruveo Services, you are responsible for keeping these details confidential. Gruveo asks you not to share these details with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is never completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use strict security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### **Group Calls**

Once the number of participants in a call changes from two to three, the call is re-routed through one of Gruveo’s SFU servers to make a group call possible. Just like in the case of call recording (see below), the call content is then encrypted in transit to and from the SFU server.

### **Connecting to the Intended Users**

By nature of how Gruveo Services works, it is not impossible that you may get connected to a user different from the person(s) you originally intended to connect to. This may happen if the third party connects to Gruveo Services using your agreed upon room name before your counterpart(s) do. Therefore, please note that all Gruveo users are encouraged to choose longer, non-trivial and specific room names for establishing their calls, as well as to lock the room once all of the expected participants have joined.

## **May User’s and Subscriber’s Content be Recorded by Us?**

Unless call recording has been explicitly initiated by a subscriber (see below), we do not store any parts of the call content such as audio/video, screenshots, text messages and the like on our servers.

### **Call Recording**

We offer the call recording feature to Gruveo subscribers. A Gruveo subscriber can record the audio and video of any part of a Gruveo call they are participating in for future playback and/or downloading. All call participants are alerted of a recording taking place with a visual indicator that is displayed for the duration of the recording, as well as an audible beep that sounds at the beginning of the recording.

If a recording has been started during a call, the call is re-routed through one of Gruveo’s SFU servers to make the recording possible. In this case, the call content is encrypted in transit to and from the SFU server.

### **Text Chat History**

Gruveo subscribers have the option to have the history of their text chats sent to them via email at the end of each call. The chat history is sent in unencrypted email messages. Please note that due to the nature of the email protocol, the content of such messages can be potentially readable to third parties.

We never record any your content without your explicit instruction (i.e. consent) expressed in your account. We do not share recorded content with any third parties, nor do we provide them with access to any call content otherwise.

## **Information We Obtain from Communications with Us**

We may process information that we obtain from communicating with you, including:

  * Information about you that you give us by communicating with us by phone, by e-mail, via our website, via social media or otherwise.
  * Information you give us or that we obtain when you use our website, obtain or subscribe to our services, supply us with goods or services, enquire about a services, or contact us to report a problem, or do any of these things on behalf of the person that you work for.

We may process information relating to our dealings with you or the person that you work for, including:

  * Information relating to transactions with us involving you or the person that you work for (for example, details of services that we have supplied to, or obtained from, you or the person you work for).
  * Other information relating to you which it is necessary for us to process in order to enter into or perform a contract with you or the person that you work for.

## What Are the Legal Grounds for Our Processing of Your Personal Data?

The legal basis on which we process your personal data is as follows:

  * Where it is necessary to obtain your prior consent to the processing concerned in order for us to be allowed to do it, we will obtain and rely on your consent in relation to the processing concerned ( _see below for **how to withdraw your consent at any time**_ ).  
In general, we need your consent, if you are not Gruveo user and you would like to receive our Gruveo Connect Newsletters. Also your consent is required, if you will choose recording of your content at Gruveo Services (see Call Recording and Text Message History).
  * Otherwise, we will process your personal data where the processing is necessary: 
    * for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into such a contract.  
For example, we rely on the contract where we process personal data of our subscribers and other electronic communications data in order to the Gruveo services may be duly provided;
    * for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are a subject; or
    * for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, provided that this will only be in circumstances in which those legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of personal data ( _see below for **how to object to processing at any time**_ ).  
For example, our processing is based on our legitimate interest in the most circumstances in which we process your personal data in relation to a relationship that we have with the person that you work. We also rely on our legitimate interest, if we process data due to keeping our systems safe and secure.
