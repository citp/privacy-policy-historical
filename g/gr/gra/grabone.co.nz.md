This information and your other personal information will be kept safe and secure. We will store your credit card and billing information and use it to pay for any deals that you purchase (at the time you give us that information and in the future). However, if you do not want us to store this information, please let us know at the time you enter these details (you will have the ability to do this on our payment page at the time you enter this information).

### Orders

**Can I return my GrabOne Coupon?**  
Once you have purchased a deal you are committed to the transaction and your credit card will be charged immediately following confirmation of the deal. Except where we are required to under law or in relation to our GrabOne Promise, we do not give refunds or allow exchanges.

**What if the business for my GrabOne Coupon closes down or does not honour my GrabOne Coupon?**  
If a business that is supposed to provide goods or services to you under a deal closes down, or if that business does not honour your GrabOne Coupon, we'll make sure you get your money back. Please refer to the [GrabOne Promise](https://web.archive.org/legal/grabone-promise) for the specific terms that apply.
