Gracenote, Inc., a Nielsen Company (“ **Gracenote** ,” “ **we** ,” or “ **us** ”), is committed to protecting your privacy and handling your information in an open and transparent manner. This Privacy Statement explains how we use, share, and protect the information we gather about you via gracenote.com and any other Gracenote website where this Privacy Statement is posted or linked (collectively, “ **this Website** ”) and when we perform any activities that form part of the operation of this Website and related services (e.g., when we send you marketing-related communications). This Privacy Statement also describes your choices and legal rights in relation to such information.

Please note that this Privacy Statement applies only to information collected by Gracenote through your interaction with this Website and through our performance of other activities that form part of the operation of this Website and related services.

**Collection of Your Information**  
We collect or otherwise obtain information relating to you in a variety of ways.

Additional details about the information we may gather about you can be found below.

When you register or create an account on this Website, submit a question or request (e.g., to learn more about our data and services), sign up for an event that we are hosting, or provide us with feedback, we will collect the information that you voluntarily provide, such as your name, email address, phone number, employment details, and geographical location.

This Website may host various blogs, message boards, forums, or other services (including social media services) that allow you to share information and content with other visitors. Any personal information or other information that you voluntarily post can be read, collected, and used by other visitors to this Website, and we have little or no control over how they may use such information. You should keep this in mind when sharing any personal information or other information on this Website.

As is true of most websites, when you visit and browse this Website, we also gather certain information automatically, including log usage data (e.g., when you view or click on content) and information from your device and network, including your IP address, browser operating system and version, device identifier and features, access times, and referring website addresses.

We may use cookies (i.e., small text files placed on your device) and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, and ad tags) to enable certain features and functionality and collect additional information that helps us to improve this Website and better deliver our services to you. In particular, we may use cookies (session cookies and persistent cookies) to identify your browser or device, display information more effectively, provide you with tailored content, and gather statistical information about how you use this Website. We may also use such technologies for security purposes and to detect and defend against fraud and other risks in order to protect this Website’s visitors. If you do not wish to have information collected from your device by cookies, most browsers allow you to control and decline the use of cookies through the browser settings. Please note, however, that if you decline the use of cookies or limit the ability of this Website to set cookies, some of its features may not work properly. To learn more about our use of cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

We also use Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that may set cookies in your browser, in order to help us understand how visitors engage with this Website.

We generally do not seek sensitive personal information (e.g., information relating to an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or other similar beliefs, health or medical conditions, criminal background, or trade union membership) about visitors to this Website. If you voluntarily provide sensitive personal information for any reason or we are required to collect such information as a result of legal requirements imposed on us, we will, where necessary, obtain your explicit consent and use such information in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable law.

**Use of Your Information**  
We use your information for the purpose(s) for which it was collected or provided to us (as stated at the point of collection) or as otherwise obvious from the context of collection. We may also use your information to:

  * administer and manage this Website, communicate with you about this Website, and respond to your inquiries and requests;
  * customize or personalize your user experience and the content we deliver to you;
  * conduct research and analytics about how you use and interact with this Website;
  * protect the rights, safety, property, or operations of Gracenote or our affiliates, you, or others; and

We may also use your information for marketing purposes or to send you promotional materials or other communications about Gracenote’s business, products/services, and events that may be of interest to you. You may unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time by contacting us at [gnmarketing@nielsen.com](mailto:gnmarketing@nielsen.com) or clicking on the unsubscribe link in any of our communications to you. After you unsubscribe, we will not send you further promotional materials or communications, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary for the purposes of any services you have requested.

**Legal Basis for the Processing of Your Personal Information**  
Applicable law in your country of residence may require us to set out in this Privacy Statement the legal basis upon which we rely in order to process your personal information.

If you are based in the European Union (“ **EU** ”)/European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”), we will process your personal information for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement based on: (a) the consent that you provide us at the point of collection of your personal information to use such information for certain specific purposes; or (b) our legitimate interests, provided that such interests are not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights, or freedoms. In particular, we may process your personal information in reliance on a legitimate interest in the effective and lawful operation of this Website and our businesses as well as the effective delivery of information and services to you. We may have other legitimate interests and, if so, we will make clear what those interests are at the relevant point in time. To the extent that we process any sensitive personal information relating to you, we will do so because either: (a) you have given us your explicit consent to process the information; (b) the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or (c) you have made the information manifestly public.

If you have any questions or concerns about the legal basis upon which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at [privacy.department@nielsen.com](mailto:privacy.department@nielsen.com).

**Disclosures of Your Information**

  * relevant third parties as part of a corporate transaction, such as a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceeding);
  * competent governmental and public authorities, in each case to comply with legal or regulatory obligations or requests; and
  * other third parties as we believe necessary or appropriate for legal purposes.



All of these disclosures may result in the transfer of your information to countries or regions with data protection laws that differ from those in your country of residence. By providing us with your information and using this Website, you are acknowledging that your information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence.

In cases where your information is transferred outside of your country of residence, we will ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect your personal information.

If we become aware that we have collected personal information relating to a minor, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.

**Information Security**  
We have in place reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures that are designed to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, and other forms of unlawful processing while it is under our control. However, please be aware that the storage and transfer of information cannot always be one-hundred percent secure.

**Information Retention**  
We will retain your information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, unless applicable law or professional obligations requires a longer retention period.
