**Collection of Non-Personal Information**  
Whenever you visit a web page on the internet, your browser automatically identifies the IP address from where your page request was initiated – i.e. your computer. It also volunteers certain basic information like browser type, the operating system you are running, and in some cases the page which referred to the Site (if you clicked a link from another website). The Administrator's server automatically collects this information and tracks it on a page by page and on a statistical basis.

The Administrator uses non-personal information such as the region or country your IP request came from to suggest the appropriate language to use or to select the best presentation aligned to that region of the world. We also use browser type, operating system, and page visits for statistical analysis of site usage and navigation trends.
