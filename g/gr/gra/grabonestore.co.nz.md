> Please read our full [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms-and-conditions) (Which includes the [General Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms-and-conditions), [Membership Terms](https://web.archive.org/legal/membership-terms) and [Subscriber Terms](https://web.archive.org/legal/subscriber-terms)) and [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/privacy-policy). The most commonly requested information is summarised below.

### Your information

**What will you do with my email address?**  
We take your personal information very seriously - our focus is to use your email to inform you of our great deals every day.

You'll receive information about our GrabOne Store deals in your inbox daily, and occasional alerts relating to any purchases you make through the GrabOne Store website. Your email address will not be disclosed to any third party. Our Privacy Policy and Subscriber Terms provide full disclosure, please read over these.

**What will you do with my credit card and billing information?**  
Credit card and billing information is obtained from you via a Secure Socket Layer connection (SSL), which is fully encrypted. This information and your other personal information will be kept safe and secure. We will store your credit card and billing information and use it to pay for any deals that you purchase (at the time you give us that information and in the future). However, if you do not want us to store this information, please let us know at the time you enter these details (you will have the ability to do this on our payment page at the time you enter this information).

### Orders & Returns Policy

**Can I return my GrabOne Store product?**  
Once you have purchased a deal you are committed to the transaction and your credit card will be charged immediately following confirmation of the deal. 

If you have a problem with your purchase, then you'll need to contact our customer services team [helpdesk@GrabOneStore.co.nz](mailto:helpdesk@grabonestore.co.nz) or give us a call 0800 GRABONE (0800 472 2663)

You will need to send it back to us or directly to the supplier. Think of us as being like a normal shop - when you buy something and you have a problem, you take it back to the store. We run on the same principle, so shipping is at your cost.

You need to bear in mind that we will repair and/or replace faulty goods, but won't necessarily refund them unless we are unable to repair or replace. This is as per our obligations under the Consumer Guarantees Act. We won't take goods back for "buyer’s remorse" - if you change your mind, there's no guarantee sorry.

Nothing in these terms and conditions limits your rights under the Consumer Guarantee Act 1993.
