Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to third-party sites or gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third-party site, whether by means of a link on this Site or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that site, and should take those steps necessary to your discretion, to protect your privacy.</p><p>6.

It is therefore important that you register with the site and notify us if you change your email address.

Notice<br>We will inform you about the purposes for which we collect and use your Personally-Identifying Information, the third parties to whom we disclose your Personally-Identifying Information, and the choices and means, if any, we offer you for limiting the use and disclosure of your Personally-Identifying Information. We will provide you with notice of such practices in clear and conspicuous language when you are first asked to provide Personally-Identifying Information to us, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before: (i) we use your Personally-Identifiable Information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected; (ii) your Personally-Identifiable Information is processed by a transferring organization; or (iii) we disclose your Personally-Identifying Information for the first time to a third party. As discussed in this Privacy Policy, we will disclose your Personally-Identifying Information as described in Section 4 (“Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personally–Identifying Information”).</p><p><br>If you have any questions, please contact us at the following address:</p><p><br>Chief Privacy Officer <br>EU Safe Harbor <br>National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, Inc. <br>3030 Olympic Blvd._<br>Santa Monica, CA 90404</p><p><br>B.	Choice<br>Users located in the EEA may direct us not to disclose their Personally-Identifying Information to third parties (other than our service providers). We do not use Personally-Identifying Information for purposes incompatible with the purposes for which we originally collected the information without notifying the relevant individuals of such uses and offering an opportunity to opt out.</p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may disclose Personally-Identifying Information without offering individuals the opportunity to opt out for the reasons described in more detail in Sections 4(C)(v) (“By Law, to Protect Rights and to Comply with Our Policies”) and 4(C)(vi) (“Business Transfers; Bankruptcy”) above.</p><p><br>C.	Data Integrity <br>We will use Personally-Identifying Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personally-Identifying Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.</p><p><br>D.	Onward Transfer <br>We may share Personally-Identifying Information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. We require service providers to whom we disclose Personal Information and who are not subject to laws based on the European Union Data Protection Directive to contractually agree to provide at least the same level of protection for Personally-Identifying Information as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor principles.</p><p><br>E.	Security <br>We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personally-Identifying Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p><p><br>F.	Access <br>Upon request, we will grant individuals reasonable access to Personally-Identifying Information that we hold about them for the purpose of correcting, amending, or deleting such Personally-Identifiable Information where it is inaccurate; provided, however, that we reserve the right to deny access or limit access in cases where the burden or cost of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or in the case of a vexatious or fraudulent request.

Any of our employees who wishes to review or update their Personally-Identifying Information can do so by contacting their human resources representative.</p><p><br>G.	Enforcement<br>If we become aware that the security of the Site has been compromised or your Personally- Identifiable Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonable appropriate measures, including but not limited to, investigation and reporting, and notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities.</p><p>If we become aware that your Personally-Identifiable Information has been disclosed in a manner not permitted by this Privacy Policy, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you, as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law, of what information has been disclosed, to the extent that we know this information.</p><p><br>We are also subject to the jurisdiction of the US Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Trade Commission may be contacted at the following address:</p><p><br>Federal Trade Commission <br>Attn: Consumer Response Center <br>600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW <br>Washington, DC 20580 <br>consumerline@ftc.gov<br>www.ftc.gov</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
