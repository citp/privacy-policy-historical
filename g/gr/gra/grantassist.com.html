          We are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitor's personally
          identifiable information. To better protect your privacy, we provide
          this notice explaining our online information practices and the
          choices you can make about the way your information is used at our
          site. <br>
          <br>
          What Information We Collect and How We Use It <br>
          <br>
          <b>Personally Identifiable Information<br>
&nbsp;</b></font></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
          <font face="Verdana" size="2">When you place an order for products or
          services we collect certain types of personally identifiable
          information including contact information, such as name, address,
          e-mail address, and telephone number; and if you choose to provide it,
          other personal information, such as a credit card number. <br>
          <br>
          We use this information to process requests for products and services
          by way of customer support for your guaranteed satisfaction. We also
          use collected information to communicate with you, such as to notify
          you (through e-mails and newsletters) about updates to products, to
          send you order confirmations, or to provide you with important product
          warranty or safety information. <br>
          <br>
          In addition, we use contact information you provide to respond to your
          inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you, by means of e-mail or
          through our newsletter, additional products, programs or services that
          we believe may be of interest to you. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Sharing of Your information <br>
          </b><br>
Protecting personally identifiable information about our partners and clients is an essential cornerstone of our business.  We share and disclose such information only as described below.

www.GrantAssist.com sends very limited personally identifiable information about you (such as your email address or phone number) to other companies or people: 1) when we determine that the information will be used in a way that will greatly benefit the consumer.  We enjoy assisting our clients with the best quality and economical information to assist them in their financial education; 2) when we need to share your information with third parties, such as banks and credit card processors, to provide the product or service you have requested; 3) in connection with products and services offered by www.GrantAssist.com business partners and/or companies who work on behalf of www.GrantAssist.com to provide a product or service to you; 4) it is appropriate to comply with law; 5) it is necessary to enforce or apply the terms and conditions of our Terms of Service and / or other applicable agreements; or 6) it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of www.GrantAssist.com, our users, or others, which may include the exchange of information with other organizations for fraud protection and/or risk reduction. In the event that www.GrantAssist.com is acquired, customer account information may be one of the transferred assets.
                <br>
                <br>
          Agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable
          information are required to protect it in a manner that is consistent
          with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information
          for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are
          performing for www.GrantAssist.com. <br>
          <br>
          In addition, we will share aggregated demographic information with our
          Strategic Partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable
          information. <br>
          <br>
          Our Collection of Personally Identifiable Information Through a
          Third-party Web Site <br>
          <br>
          To provide you with content and service, we have relationships with
          many of the best service and content companies. As a result of these
          relationships, you can access www.GrantAssist.com through a third-party Web
          site. You can recognize most of the www.GrantAssist.com pages on these
          third-party sites by looking for the joint branding of www.GrantAssist.com and
          a third-party company. For example, if you see a logo on the page that
          says "Powered by www.GrantAssist.com," you are on a co-branded page. <br>
          <br>
          Whenever you provide registration information on a co-branded page,
          that data may be shared with the third-party site through which you
          access www.GrantAssist.com. If personally identifiable information may be
          provided to such a third party, we will inform you at the point of
          collection and provide you with an opportunity to tell us not to share
          your personally identifiable information. We encourage you to read the
          privacy policies of such third parties, as this Notice does not cover
          their use of information <br>
          <br>
          <b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information <br>
          </b><br>
          We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about
          our visitors when you visit many of our Web pages such as the type of
          browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of
          operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS X) and the
          domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., AOL,
          PeoplePC). <br>
          <br>
          We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to
          improve the design and content of our service pages and to enable us
          to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this
          information in the aggregate to analyze service usage. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Legal Process/Disclaimer <br>
          </b><br>
          We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to
          legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires
          it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law
          enforcement agency's request <br>
          <br>
          <b>Choices/Opt Out <br>
          </b><br>
          If you prefer not to receive marketing information or wish to fully
          deactivate your account information from us, simply let us know by
          sending a letter via certified mail to www.GrantAssist.com at 12316 Rosebriar Ln, Riverton, UT 84065. Please note that even if you
          chose to opt out of www.GrantAssist.com's marketing, we will continue to send
          you important service-related communications (e.g., order confirmation
          or product safety information). However, these are not promotional in
          nature. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Cookies <br>
          </b><br>
          To enhance your experience with our site, we use "cookies." Cookies
          are used by your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use
          both session and persistent cookies. Cookies, by themselves, do not
          tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable
          information unless you choose to provide this information to us by,
          for example, registering at one of our sites. <br>
          <br>
          We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and
          offerings on our sites. If you set your browser not to accept cookies,
          you will still be able to use our site. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Links <br>
          </b><br>
          In addition, our site contains links to other Web sites whose
          information practices may be different than ours. Our privacy policy
          does not cover these third parties' use of information. Visitors
          should consult the other companies' and sites' privacy notices as we
          have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected
          by, these third parties. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Security <br>
          </b><br>
          We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
          procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain
          data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.
          <br>
          <br>
          All information submitted is protected by our secure server, which
          automatically encrypts your personally identifiable information so
          that it cannot be read while traveling over the Internet. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Reviewing Your Information <br>
          </b><br>
          If you would like to review and update or correct the personally
          identifiable information that we have collected from you online, or if
          no longer wish to continue your service with us, simply submit your
          request via our <a href="contact_us.php" title="Contect Us">Contact Us</a> form.
          <br>
          <br>
          To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to
          help verify your identity before granting access or making
          corrections. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Notification of Changes <br>
          </b><br>
          If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a
          materially different manner from that stated at the time of
          collection, we will notify you directly (e.g., via e-mail). You will
          have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this
          different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our
          privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored
          in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site
          notifying users of the change. However, if you have opted out of
          communication with the site then you will not be contacted, nor will
          your personal information be used in this new manner. <br>
