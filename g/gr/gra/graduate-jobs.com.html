<h3>IP Addresses</h3>

<p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and

data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your usage by storing a cookie on your computer. They help us
to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Some of the cookies we use are essential
for the site to operate. Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well
as to provide information to the owners of the site.</p>

<p>When you visit our website a number of cookies are placed on your computer. Here is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">Wikipedia article about cookies</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the terms and conditions for using graduate-jobs.com, you consent to graduate-jobs.com (and third
parties) placing cookies on your computer.</p>

<p>We place a cookie on your computer called JSESSIONID which allows us to recognise whether or not you are logged in

article. No personal information is stored in the cookie. The cookie is invalidated when you log out and is deleted
when you close the browser. It is only available to graduate-jobs.com and never to any other website.</p>

<p>Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.</p>

<p>Some of the advertisements you see on our site are provided by third parties who specialise in serving and tracking
advertising campaigns. They store cookies on your computer to help them compile anonymous statistics about the
campaigns. Another third party collects data on our behalf so that we can measure website use and performance. They
store anonymous information in a cookie.</p>

<h3>Where We Store Your Personal Data</h3>

<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic
Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our
suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your
payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this
transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated
securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have
chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this
password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our
best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any
transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and
security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

<h3>Uses Made of the Information</h3>

<p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.</li>
	<li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.</li>
	<li>To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.</li>
	<li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.</li>
	<li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your data, to provide you with information about
goods and services which may be of interest to you and we or they may contact you about these by post or telephone.</p>

<p>If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing
purposes, please click on the unsubscribe link in any of the automated emails we send to you.</p>

<p>We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with
aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men have clicked on their
advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of
audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected
from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target
audience.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of Your Information</h3>

<p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate

	<li>If graduate-jobs.com UK Ltd or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
	<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our <a href="/gco/tc.jsp">terms of use</a> and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of graduate-jobs.com UK Ltd, our customers, or others.
