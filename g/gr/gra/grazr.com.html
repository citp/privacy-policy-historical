<h2>Server Logs and IP Addresses</h2>
<p>The Grazr Web servers record general information about user activity to log files. We use these logs to ensure smooth operation of our servers, and for general website and application maintenance. Our logs may include timestamps, your browser IP address (as it appears to the server), and the feeds you open. Our detailed server logs will not be shared with any third party. We may, however, publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity from time to time based on log information, such as the number of feeds served over a specific period of time. We will never publish any personally identifiable information in these analyses.</p>
<h2>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>Grazr Corp allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Grazr.com site and the Grazr widget. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Grazr.com site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.</p>
<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
<p>Grazr Corp may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Grazr Corp is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
<h2>Changes and Updates</h2>
<p>This privacy policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Grazr.com site constitutes your agreement to this privacy policy and any future revisions.</p>
<h2>Date Last Modified</h2>
