    <section>
        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Grasshopper, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.

        <h3>Surveys <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Contests</h3>
        <p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice.

    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users information.  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
        <p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just surfing.</p>
        <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users information is protected.  Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. </p>
        <p>If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can <a href="https://support.grasshopper.com/anonymous_requests/new">submitting a ticket</a> to our Customer Support Center.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Supplementation of Information </h3>
        <p>In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Address Verification</h3>
        <p>We use Authorize.net to verify a user's address for credit card authentication purposes.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
        <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by <a href="https://support.grasshopper.com/anonymous_requests/new">submitting a ticket</a> to our Customer Support Center.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
        <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Contact Information</h3>
        <p>If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at:</p>
