What personally identifiable information does GratisPoints collect from me?

Who is collecting information and for what purpose?

GratisPoints collects valuable information, which assists in developing new products and services. When you are on an GratisPoints site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with GratisPoints or with any other third party with whom you elect to share such information, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than GratisPoints, the use of your data and personal information will be governed by appropriate confidentiality and security agreements between GratisPoints and such third parties. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service or by electing not to participate in any given survey. 

Promotions that run on GratisPoints may be sponsored by companies other than GratisPoints or may be co-sponsored by GratisPoints and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you do not want your data to be shared.

Any Sensitive Information (i.e. personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual) will be treated with additional care. If GratisPoints intends to disclose such information to a third party or to use it for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected, you will be expressly asked permission prior to any such disclosure or use.

With whom does GratisPoints share my information?

As a general rule, GratisPoints will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or User Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.

Business Partners & Sponsors: GratisPoints may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. If any personal data about you were ever to be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give GratisPoints permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfil your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information is going to be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer. 

Third Party Data & Aggregate Data: Under confidentiality agreements, GratisPoints may match user information with third party data. Also, GratisPoints discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

Other: GratisPoints may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating GratisPoints’s Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) GratisPoints’s rights or property, other GratisPoints users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. GratisPoints may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and services.

Finally, if there is a sale of a majority of the shares or assets of the legal entities owning and operating GratisPoints, you agree that your personal information and data may be transferred or assigned to such new owners.
