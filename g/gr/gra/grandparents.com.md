**Who We Share Your Personal Information With**

• Service Providers and Partners– Depending on the preferences you select when registering for an account, we may share your account and profile information with our service providers who help us manage the Site and market our products or services. In addition, if you opt-in to receiving marketing emails, we share information such as your name, email address, location, age, birthday and gender with certain trusted third parties so that they can contact you directly to market or sell their products and services. 

• Credit Card Processor- We use a third-party credit card processor to process credit card payments for memberships of the AGA. Your name, billing address, and order total are securely shared with this payment processor so that they can complete your order. Your credit card information (including your credit card number, the expiration date, and the security code on the back of your credit card) is securely transmitted to our credit card processor and stored by the credit card processor and not by us. 

• Legal Processes; Your Agent or Guardian- We may disclose information to third parties in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, or other similar legal process. If a subpoena requests information about a user, we’ll make (if permitted) reasonable business efforts to contact that user before providing information to the party that requests it, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in all cases. In addition, we disclose information that we believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our Terms of Service. We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you). 

• A Company That Purchases or Merges with Us- As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If an acquisition occurs, the successor entity would have access to the information we have collected, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
