# Privacy Policy | Infographics | Graphs.net

We know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.

**Information Collection**  
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, other information when needed to provide a service you requested.

When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish to remember your login and password. We don’t collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other commercial websites, we use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the site.

**Cookies**  
A “cookie” is a small file that a website transfers to your computer’s hard disk allowing our server to remember specific information about your session. While visiting certain pages you may occasionally encounter a web page that employs cookies to make it easier to use the dynamic features of these web pages. We use session cookies for certain functions.

The cookie and the information about your session will be destroyed automatically shortly after you close your browser- it is not permanently stored on your computer. You can set your browser to disable cookies or prompt you before a cookie is accepted. If you do not want to receive cookies, you will still be able to use our site, but will be unable to use cookie-dependent features. In exceptional circumstances, persistent cookies may be employed, but they are never used for tracking users’ queries or navigation through the site.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
Your personal information is never shared outside our site without your permission. We may send your personal information to other companies or people under any of the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information; we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of our company to provide a product or service to you (we will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you’d like to hear about either from us or from our business partners.

We will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites.

**Children under the Age of 13**  
No part of the Website or any services made available through the Website, are designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13. No personal information is knowingly collected from any person under the age of 13.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
We will amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will make that information available by posting a notice on this site.
