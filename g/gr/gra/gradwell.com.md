# GDPR Gradwell Communications | Data Protection GDPR | DPD

information security[Matthew Weeks](https://www.gradwell.com/author/matthew-weeks/ "Posts by Matthew Weeks")2018-10-11T14:07:06+00:00

As a provider of hosted unified communications services, we recognise and are committed to maintaining the highest standards of information security.

The scope of information security is broad and we believe we have taken a thorough approach with our commitment to ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer, supplier and employee data.

We operate in a highly regulated industry and in addition to adherence to voluntary codes of conduct we are a member of [ITSPA](https://www.itspa.org.uk/).

Gradwell are also an ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified organisation, reflecting our commitment to information security and continual improvement.  We have a dedicated team in place to monitor current regulation, assess compliance and coordinate activities to ensure Gradwell continue to meet requirements.

As part of our ISMS framework, we have a robust disaster recovery and failover process that is periodically tested and invest in vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify and respond effectively to potential risks.

Should you have any queries about our approach to information assurance and regulatory compliance please complete the form or contact our [Information Security](mailto:governance@gradwell.com?subject=Information%20Security%20Query) team.

## GDPR

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into legally enforceable effect on 25th May 2018 replacing the Data Protection Directive (DPD). If you are making your own preparations, you will know that this is not a trivial exercise. The good news is that we are on track to be compliant by the deadline. Our ongoing commitment to ISO27001, an international data security standard and best practice approach, along with a team dedicated to compliance has given us a significant head start.

## What is GDPR?

The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been put into effect to ensure a consistent approach, where previously a Directive (Data Protection Directive) relied on interpretation and localised laws which conflicted across European countries.

The Regulation reflects a collaboration of the European Economic Area to provide a solution to application of data protection law and enhancing the rights of individuals in the first major overhaul for many years.

Each country will have a Supervisory Authority in place to regulate compliance and issue fines dependent on the impact to the rights and privacy of the individual/s affected. For the UK this is the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) and maximum penalties for breach of the GDPR can be very high.

## [What has changed?](https://www.gradwell.com/information-security/#what-has-changed)

Anybody responsible for controlling or processing an individual’s personal data will now be required to ensure there is a lawful reason for collection and processing, where relevant consent is secured and is made freely and easy to retract, only the necessary data required is retained and only for as long as it is required.

The sharing of individual’s data is also restricted with further explicit consent being required if using or wishing to share with other parties for any other purpose than it was originally collected for unless other lawful reasons for sharing the data apply, for example to investigate criminal activity or in the best interests of the data subject.

A person will now be able to easily access their personal data, make applications to correct, port, restrict or have it deleted under qualifying circumstances.

For full details on changes to data protection regulation please refer to the ICO website [www.ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk/)

## Your Legal Rights under GDPR

**The right to be informed**

Individuals have a right to understand when their personal data is being held and processed, even when this has been obtained indirectly.

**The right of access**

You can request access to your personal data at any time to be aware of and verify the lawfulness of the processing, this is via a Subject Access Request (see below).

**The right to rectification**

Personal data can be easily rectified if inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. This can be done by updating your control panel (insert link) or by written request (please see below for information)

**The right to erasure**

Under qualifying criteria, you can request your data to be deleted where there is no lawful reason for its continued processing. Please refer to the GDPR regulation or ico.org.uk for full details.

**The right to restrict processing**

Under qualifying criteria, you can request the processing of your data to be restricted. This means your data will still be held but not processed and may apply where information is inaccurate or if there is an objection over the lawfulness of the processing. Please refer to the GDPR regulation or ico.org.uk for full details. Please send your request in writing as per the below instructions.

Where data is restricted, Gradwell shall, where possible, also inform any involved 3rd parties of the restriction.

**The right to data portability**

Individuals can request personal data to be provided in order to reuse elsewhere and/or moved from one IT environment to another in a secure manner without hindrance. Please send your request in writing as per the below instructions.

**The right to object**

Where processing of your data is taking place under certain purposes and no legitimate reason exists for this, you have the right to object. Please send your request in writing as per the below instructions.

**Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling**

Automated decision making, and profiling can only take place where consent or a lawful reason apply. Processors are also required to notify individuals when their data is processed by automated means and provide information about the processing and lawful reason for doing so. It should be straightforward for an individual to challenge or request intervention.

## What are we doing about it?

** ** Here is a brief overview of our preparations over the last six months:

  * We have assigned a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who is part of a core team working on the project.  In addition, we have dedicated Information Asset Owners (IAOs) for each of our in-house departments to field queries and provide feedback.
  * We have a fully documented project plan and have conducted Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs). These DPIAs help us to understand what personal data is collected, how it is used and stored and feed into data flow and risk assessments
  * Though there isn’t clear published guidance we are in regular contact with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) where necessary.
  * We will provide updates as we implement new features. We are also planning a webinar to share our experiences with you as you make your own preparation.

## ISO

**ISO 27001**  is an internationally recognised information security management standard which ensures organisations can apply a framework to business processes to help identify, manage and reduce risks to information security, and considers not only IT but all business operations.

Whereas in the past, accreditation levels were required of suppliers to the enterprise market; the same assurances are increasingly sought by organisations of any size, in an effort to manage risk within the business and secure the information it relies on to perform.

**Gradwell achieved ISO 27001 certification on 10th March 2016**  and are audited regularly against the standard to maintain compliance and drive our continuous improvement programme.

**Promotional offers from us**

We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

If you receive marketing communications from us it may be because you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.

**Third-party marketing**

We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.

**Opting out**

**Cookies**

If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our Cookie Policy found above.

**Change of purpose**

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

## Disclosures of your personal data

We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table above.

  * External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
  * Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.



We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

### International transfers

Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented, data will only be transferred:

  * to a country that the European Commission deems to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data;
  * where the European Commission has approved the specific contract or contract terms; or
  * where the provider is based in the US, where it is part of the Privacy Shield.



Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

### Data Security

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

### Data Retention

**How long will you use my personal data for?**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by emailing governance@gradwell.com

### Your legal rights

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:

You have the right to:

**1\. Request access  **to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

**2\. Request correction  **of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

**3\. Request erasure  **of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

**4\. Object to processing  **of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

**5\. Request restriction of processing  **of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:

  * If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.
  * Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
  * Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
  * You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.



**6\. Request the transfer  **of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

**7\. Withdraw consent at any time  **where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at [seniortech@gradwell.com](mailto:seniortech@gradwell.com).

**No fee usually required**

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What we may need from you**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time limit to respond**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

### Lawful Basis

**Legitimate Interest**  means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.

**Performance of Contract**  means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

**Comply with a legal obligation**  means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
