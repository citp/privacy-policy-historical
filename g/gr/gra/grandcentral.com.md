# GrandCentral: The New Way To Use Your Phones

## GrandCentral Privacy Policy

  


### July 2, 2007

[The Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html) describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and services, including information provided when you use GrandCentral. In addition, the following describes our privacy practices that are specific to GrandCentral. 

**Personal information**

  * You need a GrandCentral Account to access GrandCentral. GrandCentral asks for some personal information when you create a GrandCentral Account, including your alternate contact information and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A GrandCentral account allows you to access many of our services that require registration. For Premium accounts, we also ask you for credit card and billing information. 
  * GrandCentral stores, processes and maintains your voicemail messages, recorded conversations, contact lists and other data related to your account in order to provide the service to you. 
  * When you use GrandCentral, GrandCentral's servers automatically record certain information about your use of GrandCentral. Similar to other web services, GrandCentral records information such as account activity (including storage usage, number of log-ins), data displayed or clicked on (including UI elements, ads, links), other log information (including browser type, IP-address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and referrer URL) and telephony log information (including calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, and types of calls). 



**Uses**

  * GrandCentral maintains and processes your GrandCentral account and its contents to provide the GrandCentral service to you and to improve our services. 
  * Google may send you information related to your GrandCentral account or other Google services. 



**Information sharing and onward transfer**

  * When you send email (such as by forwarding or replying to a voicemail), GrandCentral includes information such as your email address and the email itself as part of that email. 
  * We provide advertisers only aggregated non-personal information such as the number of times one of their ads was clicked. We do not sell, rent or otherwise share your personal information with any third parties except in the limited circumstances described in the Google Privacy Policy, such as when we believe we are required to do so by law. 



**Your choices**

  * You may change your GrandCentral account settings and you may upgrade or downgrade your account through the "My Account" section of our website. 
  * You may organize or delete your voicemail messages and recorded conversations through your GrandCentral inbox. 
  * You may terminate your account by contacting support@grandcentral.com. Such deletions or terminations will take immediate effect in your account view. Residual copies of deleted messages and accounts may take up to 60 days to be deleted from our active servers and may remain in our offline backup systems. 



**More information**

  * GrandCentral adheres to the US Safe Harbor privacy principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor framework or our registration, see the Department of Commerce's web site. <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>
