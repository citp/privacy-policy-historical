# Privacy Policy & Cookies | Graziashop.com

Mondadori UK Limited is a company within the Mondadori Group , which is controlled by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore SPA, a leading book and magazine publisher in Italy. Mondadori International Business S.r.l owns the Grazia trademark and operates this website through its subsidiary company, Mondadori UK Limited.

This Privacy Policy describes how we, Mondadori UK Limited and its group companies  (collectively “MB” and “we”), handle the personal information you provide to us and what we learn about you from your visit to our website, [www.graziashop.com](http://www.graziashop.com/) (the “Website”). MB recognises the importance of your privacy, and we commit to only use your personal information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and all applicable laws.

By using this Website and registering with us you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, our Terms and Conditions, and our use of your data as described below. If you have any queries regarding this Privacy Policy or complaints about our use of your information please contact us at **[hello@graziashop.com](mailto:hello@graziashop.com)** / **+44 (0) 203 754 4040** and we will do our best to deal with your complaint or query as soon as possible. If you do not agree, please cease using the Website.

## Information which we obtain about you

You do not have to register with us to enjoy using our Website. However, you will need to register if you would like to order any of our products from the Website. If you wish to register with us at [www.graziashop.com](http://www.graziashop.com/) (“Users”), we will ask you to supply us with personal information. The type of personal information we collect includes: your first and last names, your address, your email address, your phone number and, if you are using Fashion Stories our user generated content platform (the “ **UGC Platform** ”), we will also collect your chosen username and your gender (“ **Personal Information** ”).

We do not gather any information about our Users, without their knowledge and consent, other than the information set out in this Policy. The Personal Information you give us will be handled by MB in strict confidence and in accordance with UK privacy laws. Your Personal Information is collected so that we can make our website services available to you. 

## How we use your Personal Information

We use your Personal Information to:

  * create an account for you so that you can shop on our Website;
  * provide the products you have ordered and keep in touch with you regarding your order and delivery;
  * verify your details and identity for any payments and fraud protection;
  *  send offers and information to you;
  * communicate with you generally;
  * provide and improve our customer service; and
  * develop our business by taking into account User preferences and purchases.



We ask for your phone number in case we need to communicate with you in relation to any order you place. We may also share your phone number with a courier company, in case they need to contact you to deliver your order. 

If you have opted in to receiving marketing messages from us at the time of registration, we may use the Personal Information you supply us to keep you informed of any activities undertaken by us, or for carefully selected offers and promotions from ourselves or from our network of carefully selected partners, which we believe may be of interest to you. MB publishes a newsletter which you will receive if you have opted to do so. You may unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time, free of charge, by using the link in the newsletter.

Our promotions may include sending you email and postal marketing. If you do not wish to receive our marketing messages please notify us by email at the address at the top of this Privacy Policy or by changing your marketing preferences in the ‘Your Account’ section of the Website. At the time of gathering your Personal Information, and each time we send you marketing information, we give you the opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving this type of information from us. You can opt-out or unsubscribe at any time. It is not our practice to contact you if you have made it clear that you do not wish to hear from us about our products and services.

From time to time MB may offer you the chance to invite a family member or friend to enjoy a particular offer. In these circumstances we will collect Personal Information for both you and your friend or family member. We will request your consent to mention your name when we contact the friend or family member you have recommended, but we will only use this information once and we will not save it in our database, unless your friend or family member has entered a competition, for example, when the information will be stored purely for that purpose. If your friend or family member decides to take up any of our invitations, then their Personal Information will be treated in exactly the same way as your own, under the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please make sure your friend or family member is happy to receive any offer from us before inviting them and check they agree to you passing their contact details on to us.

MB may also collect data about your use of our Website, in an anonymous form, to improve our services. Data collection statements will always be visible when we collect information from you, and you can change your preferences at any time on the ‘Your Account’ section of the Website.

**(c)**     they shall promptly notify MB about: (i) any legally binding request for disclosure of your Personal Information by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited (such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a criminal investigation);  
(ii) any accidental or unauthorized access to Personal Information; and (iii) any request received directly from you, prior to responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorized to do so; and

**(d)**     any User who has suffered direct or indirect damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to above is entitled to receive compensation.

## Cookies

Our website uses cookies. A “cookie” is a file that is sent to your computer by a website and automatically saved on your computer by your web browser (e.g. “Internet Explorer”).  Each time you request a page from a website, your web browser sends this cookie back to the website server.  

We use cookies to:

  * recognise and track which parts of our Website you visit when you are using our Website; and
  * customise your experience of our Website.



We may also use the information collected from cookies to estimate our audience size, analyse trends and general usage patterns of our Website, optimise our Website, and for other research and marketing purposes.  We may also share this information with third parties, who may conduct the analysis on our behalf, or with our investors, for example, regarding numbers of visitors and purchases made. This is statistical information and does not identify any individual.

In certain circumstances we may also match cookies to Personal Information that you disclose to us or that we already hold.  These circumstances include where you have registered and provided the Personal Information referred to in the “Information which we obtain about you” section above.  We will use this information as set out in the section “What we do with your information” above. MB may also use other cookies, which stay on your computer or mobile media device even after you have gone offline. 

If you wish, you can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie so you have the chance to accept it and you can also set your browser to refuse to receive or send all cookies.  The website [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) (run by the Interactive Marketing Bureau) contains step-by-step guidance on how cookies can be switched off by users. Please be aware that if you do not accept cookies our website may not function correctly, or at all.

Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies.  These parties may use so-called “third party” cookies so that they can track your response to their adverts and/or identify you on any other website that you visit which also contains their adverts. Please refer to their privacy policies for further details.

MB uses different types of cookies on different pages of our Website, these include: 

“ **Essential Cookies** ”: these cookies are essential to the running of a MB website. They carry out essential functions on Website such as saving your login details for the session or the contents of your shopping basket or a transaction. The Essential Cookies are not stored on your computer and will be deleted when you close your web browser session;

“ **MB Marketing Cookies** ”: these cookies are normally supplied by our approved partners or used for adverts delivered from our own marketing systems. They allow us to personalise your experience and show you adverts that you might be more interested in. This tracking system uses anonymous data and, therefore, does not know who you are; and

“ **3rd Party Advertising Cookies** ”: many of our websites have advertising. The majority of the advertising is tailored to your use and uses cookies to gather information about the pages you visit and might be interested in. The tracking system uses anonymous data and, therefore, does not know who you are. The cookies simply use the limited information available to it to match adverts to your use. 

You can remove or deactivate such cookies using the settings on your computer; however, if you do this you might not be able to use all functions of this Website. If you wish to opt out of third party cookies visit [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Opting out means that the companies you have opted out from will not deliver advertising tailored to your website usage, but you will still continue to receive online advertising.

## Social media plugins 

Our Website includes plugins to social networking sites including, amongst others, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. The social media plugins allow you to share your experience of our Website on social networking sites.  
You will recognize the social media plugins by logos or buttons on the relevant page. If you click on the button, the social plugin will be activated and sets up a direct connection between your browser and the social media site. MB cannot control or review which data is transferred during this connection with the social media site, or how that site uses your data. The information relating to your use of our Website will also be transmitted. If you have logged onto a social media site, the information relating to your use of our Website will be connected to that site and can be identified with you. The same applies if you click on any ‘like’ button and if you make comments. You can prevent the information transfering to social media sites by opting not to connect to that site. You can receive additional information concerning the further use and storage of your personal information by social media sites by consulting their privacy policies.  
 

## Data Protection

The servers used to provide our website and service are protected using [HTTP and SSL] technology, so whilst your data is in our care we know it is as secure as it can be. Our staff are trained in data security, and our staff policies and procedures help our staff to understand what is required of them by us, and also their responsibilities under any applicable laws.   
By using our Website, you are agreeing and acknowledging that data protection and data privacy during data transfer via open networks (such as the Internet) cannot be completely guaranteed. You understand and acknowledge that the internet provider can view the pages stored on the web server and, perhaps, other data stored on such server at any time. The internet is not a totally secure medium and you acknowledge and agree that MB shall not be responsible for unauthorized use, distribution, damage or destruction of personal data, except to the extent that we are required to accept such responsibility under applicable laws.  
 

## Links to third party websites

Our website contains links to other websites belonging to third parties (including our retail partners).  When you click on adverts or links on our Website, you will leave our site and go to a third party site, which is outside of our control. When we place an advert on our Website, it does not mean that we are endorsing that advertiser's product or service. We do not accept responsibility for the content of third party websites. We do not control the privacy practices of these other websites.  Our Privacy Policy does not apply to these companies, sites or content and if such third party sites collect your personal information, we cannot control how your personal information is analyzed, stored or used, or that third party’s compliance with applicable law. We advise you to read their data collection statements and privacy policies before you submit your personal information. You should therefore make sure when you leave our Website that you have read that website’s privacy policy.  
 

## Transmission of Personal Information outside EEA

The Personal Information you provide to us may be given by us to our partners, retailers who process your order, our web partners and group companies worldwide (including the US).

However, we will always take steps to ensure that your Personal Information is used by third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy and that it is kept secure. If you do not consent to this transfer, then please do not subscribe as a User as we will be unable to provide you with our services.
