Personally Identifiable Information  
Grande Communications does not sell or rent your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address). Grande Communications may send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: (1) We have your consent to share the information; (2) We need to share your information to provide the service you have requested; (3) We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Grande Communications to provide a service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us); and (4) We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process.

How we collect information  
Grande Communications collects information online by asking you for it, for example, to order a service, apply for a job, or in responding to your e-mail. Grande Communications may also use "cookies" and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to our sites in an aggregated data format that does not identify you. These tools tell us the parts of our Web sites or e-mails in which you showed or took some action and help us improve the quality and usefulness of our site.

Security  
We use encryption, firewalls and other technology and security procedures to help protect the accuracy and security of your personal information and prevent unauthorized access or improper use. For example, you will note that the online payments section on the Web site requires that you submit a password.

General Violations of the Acceptable Use Policy  
Impersonation/Forgery: Adding, removing or modifying identifying network header information (a.k.a. "spoofing") in an effort to deceive or mislead is prohibited. Attempting to impersonate any person by using forged headers or other identifying information is especially frowned upon. Please note the use of anonymous re-mailers and nicknames does not constitute impersonation.

Network unfriendly activity: Any activities which adversely affect the ability of other people or systems to use Grande services or the Internet is prohibited. This includes "denial of service" (DOS) attacks against another network host or individual user.

Privacy violations: Attempts, whether successful or unsuccessful, to gain access to any computer system or customer's data, without consent, are prohibited.

Threats: Threats of bodily harm or destruction of property are always prohibited. 

Inappropriate Content  
There is content on the Internet, or otherwise available through the Services, which some may find offensive or disturbing. It is possible to obtain access to content which is pornographic or offensive. Neither Grande Communications nor any of its content distributors can assume any responsibility for the content contained on the Internet or otherwise available through the Service. You must assume the risk of accessing content through the Services and neither Grande Communications nor any of its distribution affiliates shall have any liability for any claims, losses, damages, suits or proceedings arising out of, or otherwise related to, access to such content. You are solely responsible for any information which you publish on the Web or other Internet Services. You must ensure that the receipt of the content is appropriate. You must take appropriate precautions to prevent minors from viewing inappropriate content. Grande Communications reserves the right to refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, that it, in its sole discretion, deems to be offensive, indecent or otherwise inappropriate, regardless of whether such material is unlawful. Grande Communications has no obligation to monitor transmissions made on the Services. Grande Communications does however, have the right to monitor transmissions at any time.

E-mail  
Commercial e-mail: Sending unsolicited commercial e-mail is prohibited. Using a Grande e-mail or Web site address to collect responses from unsolicited commercial e-mail is prohibited. This includes but is not limited to, bulk mailing of commercial advertising, informational announcements, charity requests, petitions for signatures and political or religious messages. Such messages may only be sent to those who have explicitly requested them. The Services may not be used to collect e-mail from unsolicited e-mail sent from accounts on other Internet resources or e-mail services which violates this policy or the acceptable use policy of any other Internet Service Provider. In addition, unsolicited e-mail may not direct the recipient to any Web site or other resource, which uses the Services. Mail Bombing: Sending large volumes of unsolicited e-mail is prohibited. The propagation of chain letters is similarly prohibited, whether or not the recipient wishes to receive such mailings. Harassment: Sending threatening or harassing e-mail is prohibited. If after being requested to stop, a Grande user persists in e-mailing another Internet user, Grande may intervene. Extremely threatening or harassing e-mail is always prohibited. Grande Communications is not responsible for the forwarding of e-mail sent to any account, which has been suspended or terminated. Such mail will be returned to the sender, ignored or deleted at Grande Communications' sole discretion.

Web Space  
As part of the Services, Grande Communications provides storage space and access for Web pages through its personal Web hosting services. You are solely responsible for any information you publish within this personal storage space. All content published within this space must honor all aspects of the inappropriate content clause of this Acceptable Use Policy.

Newsgroups  
Messages posted to newsgroups must comply with the written charters of FAQs for those newsgroups. Advertisements, solicitations or other commercial messages should be posted only in those newsgroups whose characters of FAQs explicitly permit them. You are responsible for determining the policies of a given newsgroup before posting to it. Posting or cross-posting the same or substantially similar messages to more than seven newsgroups is prohibited. Do not post binary files to USENET groups not specifically named for such purposed, namely the *.binaries and *.pictures hierarchies. Binary postings are not allowed in any Grande.* newsgroup, with the exception of small test postings to Grande.test. Use your Grande FTP and Web space to distribute binaries. Newsgroup spamming: Spam is, first and foremost, a numerical metric-Posting substantively similar articles individually to multiple newsgroups is spamming by definition. This form of Spam is sometimes referred to as "excessive multi-posting" (EMP). Grande Communications considers "multi-posting" to seven or more groups within a two-week sliding window to be excessive. Grande servers currently limit the number of allowable "cross-posts" to seven. The full version of the clarification and definition of what constitutes Spam is posted regularly to the newsgroup news.admin.net-abuse.misc. This article is posted once per week and is intended to describe the current consensus Spam thresholds and ensure that the definitions of the terms are available. It is believed that most Spam cancelers use these definitions and thresholds. Flames, hostile attacks or invectives aimed at a group or an individual poster, are generally considered inappropriate Grande service groups. Flames in the non-service groups are not encouraged. Many newsreaders offer filtering capabilities that will bring certain messages to your attention or skip over them all together (kill files). You may not forge or remove header information. This includes attempts, whether successful or unsuccessful, to circumvent the approval process for posting to moderated groups or the issuance of news control messages. Grande Communications may cancel such articles. You may not cancel messages other than your own. You may cancel posts forged in your name.

Internet Relay Chat (IRC)  
The Services may be used to participate in "chat" discussions. Grande Communications will not monitor the contents of these discussions and is not liable for the contents of any communications made via Internet chat. The Service may not be used to send messages that disrupt another user's equipment, including software, hardware and user display. These Services may not be used to "flood" a chat room or to perform acts of "flooding" of chat services. Flooding is defined as the deliberate act of repeating text-generating actions in quick succession in order to prevent other service users from utilizing the chat service. The use of IRC "Bots" is prohibited, as is the violation of any accepted policies on IRC servers. If Grande Communications is banned from a server, the offending account will be terminated. Any computer or other device connected to through the services may not maintain more than three simultaneous chat connections. This includes the use of automated program, such as "bot" or "clones." The Service may not be used to access any chat server in violation of the acceptable use policy of that server. The Services may not be used to manipulate any chat server in order to disconnect or harass other Internet users, or to gain unauthorized access to network resources. A customer may not use the Services to connect to chat servers or channels from which they have previously been banned.

Financial  
Reselling service without express written consent from Grande Communications, or offering any public information service, such as running a Web server or FTP server, is prohibited. Untimely payment of any and all amounts due may result in account cancellation.

Excessive Bandwidth or Disk Utilization  
Grande Communications reserves the right to set limits on bandwidth and disk utilization and use in excess of those limits is not permitted. The total number of bytes transferred from an account's Web and FTP space determines bandwidth utilization. The total number of bytes required to store an account's Web, FTP and Mail data determines disk utilization. If excessive bandwidth or disk space utilization is determined to adversely affect Grande's ability to provide service, immediate action will be taken. The account owner will be notified by e-mail as soon as practicable.

Line of Service Demarcation  
Grande Communications will provide technical support for one modem and one computer connection to the Services of the network. Grande Communications or any member of its technical support team does not support any additional internal networking within the customer's premise, regardless of who installed it. Grande is not responsible for supporting and sharing networking printer devices or other shared resources within the customer's premise.

Section 2. Rationale and Ruminations

Rationale  
This Section attempts to provide a general understanding of Grande's AUP. Common sense and judgment are a necessary part of any system of rules and this AUP is no exception. Of course, flagrant or repeated violations of the policy are viewed in a very different light than minor infractions. Grande considers net-abuse an action that undermines the ability of the Internet to serve as a discussion medium. In addition, net-abuse may be a violation of state or federal law, or the laws of other countries. Protection of our customers and our resources, the ability to provide quality service to our customers, conformance with existing law and the protection of our reputation as a service provider are all contributing factors to decisions on AUP violations. It is our intention to allow Grande customers access to everything the Internet has to offer with minimal or no interference. Our belief in free speech is a firm commitment to our customers. However, just as free speech does not include the right to shout "Fire" in a crowded theater, certain activities are considered inappropriate by the Internet community-at-large and cannot be permitted under the guise of free speech. Grande Communications does not censor the content of any newsgroups. We believe such choices should be left to the individual. We do advise our users that tools are available to screen an account's access to newsgroups one considers offensive. It is the account owner's responsibility to make use of such tools if desired. Grande Communications does not monitor the activity of accounts except for measurements of system utilization and billing records. However, in our efforts to promote good citizenship within the Internet community, if we become aware of inappropriate use of Grande service, we will respond. If a Grande Communications account is used to violate the AUP, we reserve the right to terminate service without notice. Our preferred course of action would be to advise the account owner of the inappropriate behavior and corrective action necessary. However, flagrant violations of the AUP may result in immediate termination of service. In the event that an account is temporarily inactivated as a result of any prohibited activities, the account may be subject to reactivation charges and/or deposit requirements determined by Grande Communications.
