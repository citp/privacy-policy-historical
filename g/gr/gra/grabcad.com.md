**GrabCAD® Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) governs our, Stratasys, Inc.'s (“ **Stratasys** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **our** ” or “ **us** ”), information collection, processing and usage practices in connection with the use of the website [https://grabcad.com](https://grabcad.com/) (the " **Site** ") and/or any GrabCAD-branded software products or services, or related hardware, that we operate or provide (" **Applications** ", and together with the Site, the " **Services** "). The section and sub-section headings used below are for convenience of reading only (and are not to be used for interpretive purposes), but we hope they make navigating this Privacy Policy easier. 

The Services may not be hosted by us – all or some of the hosting is done by third party service providers that we engage. This means that data you provide us or that we or third parties collect from you (including any Personal Information, as defined below) is hosted with such third party service providers on servers that they own or control. Regardless of where such third party service providers are located (and some are located in the US), their servers may be located anywhere in the world (including the US). Your data may even be replicated across multiple servers located in multiple countries. So please be aware that you are consenting to your data being transferred to various third party service providers around the world (including the US) for such hosting purposes. 

Generally speaking, Stratasys receives information because: 

  * (a)

You have provided it to us;

  * (b)

We collect it from you; and/or

  * (c)

Third parties we engage (such as data analytics providers) collect it from you on our behalf. This happens in cases where we use or deploy third party tracking technology, or where we otherwise give these third parties access to the Site, Applications, and other technology. **So where we describe below in Section ‎3 (Information We Collect From You) the ways in which we collect information from you, you acknowledge that such collection may also be carried out by third parties.** These third parties may have their own privacy policies that they adhere to, so they won't necessarily adhere to this Privacy Policy; however, we do try to engage third parties that post a privacy policy. Also, just as with our third party hosting providers, these third parties may be based (and their servers may be located) anywhere in the world. 



  * 1.

**Consent and Modification.** You are not legally obligated to provide us with Personal Information, and you confirm that providing us with Personal Information is at your own free will. By using any part of the Services, you hereby consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the practices described herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use any part of the Services. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and your continued use of any part of the Services thereafter means that you accept those changes. 

  * 2.

**Information You Provide To Us.** You may provide Personal Information to us in the following ways: 

  * 2.1.

Account. In order to use certain Applications, you may be required to create an account (“ **Account** ”), which will require you (or in some cases, may just give you the option) to provide Personal Information, such as your name and email address. We may also offer the option of creating an Account through connecting via a third party account (a " **Third Party Account** "), in which case you will be required to approve the connection as well as the types of information (which may include Personal Information) that is made available to us from, and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with, that Third Party Account. Even if you later disconnect your Account from the Third Party Account, we still keep a copy of the Personal Information that we received from the connection of the two accounts. 

In either case event, we may send you an email, text message, or other electronic message confirming your Account creation (or otherwise instructing you how to confirm it). 

  * 2.2.

‘Contact Us’ Information. If you send us a “Contact Us” request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available or by sending an email to an email address that we display, by using a feedback or reporting feature, or by other means, you may be required to provide us with certain information such as your name and email address. 

  * 2.3.

Purchases. If you make a purchase via the Services, you will be required to provide account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data required to process and fulfill the purchase. We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly (or other periodic) payments. We may use the products and services of third party service providers to process and fulfill such purchases, in which case you will be providing the information to them as well. 

  * 2.4.

Profile. Some of the Services may enable you to build a public profile in connection with your Account (“ **Public Profile** ”). Your Public Profile will include your name, but you may choose to provide other Personal Information, such as your gender, a profile picture, and other information that we may offer you to present. 

  * 2.5.

Share with Others. The Services may offer features enabling you to invite others to use the Services, for example by sending an invitation email from the Site to the recipient's external email address. If you send or post an invitation, you will be providing us with Personal Information about the recipient such as his/her email address or online account user name and id. 

  * 2.6.

Blogs, Newsletters, Surveys and Promotions. The Site contains a blog forum displaying information about Stratasys and some of its products and services. The Site may also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to newsletters and participate in surveys and other promotional activities. In each of the foregoing cases, your interaction (such as responding on the blog forum, subscribing to a newsletter, or participating in a survey) may require you to provide certain Personal Information such as your name and email address. 

  * 3.

**Information We Collect From You**. We collect Personal Information and other anonymous data from you in the following ways: 

  * 3.1.

Log Files; Device and Usage Data. We collect information through server log files, but also by deploying tracking technologies within the Site and the Applications, and we may also associate this information with your Account. We do this to analyze trends, track user movement around the Site and Applications, gather demographic information, and to generally collect information that we may find insightful or helpful. The type of information collected may include (but is not limited to) internet protocol (IP) addresses (which may vary from session to session), MAC address, mobile network information including phone number, device type and hardware model, browser type, operating system type, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp of Site or Application use, referring/exit pages, and clicked pages. For example, the Site uses Google Analytics, more information on which you can find here: <https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/>. 

  * 3.2.

Cookies. The Site and the Applications may use "cookies". A cookie is text file placed on your hard drive and stored by your browser. We use cookies to administer, and provide you with access to, the Site and such Applications; but we also use cookies to improve the user experience of the Site and such Applications (for example, cookies and other technologies may serve to recall an IP address previously indicated by a user) and to collect statistical or anonymous data about how you and other users use and interact with the Site and such Applications, which may include for the purpose of serving advertisements. Some of the cookies are set by us, and some may be set by third parties, in which case the third party hosts it (for example, social plug-ins, such as a "Like" button, involve the setting of cookies by the applicable third party). If you do not want to receive cookies, consult your respective browser settings. This may allow you to receive notifications when cookies are set, or to otherwise block cookies altogether. You may also be able to delete cookies that have already been set. If you do block or restrict cookies, various features and functionality of the Site and/or Applications may be impaired. 

  * 4.

**The Way We Use Personal Information.** In addition to the uses of Personal Information described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we also use Personal Information in the following ways: 

  * 4.1.

To Generally Provide You with the Services. We will use Personal Information to: (a) administer and provide the Site and Applications to you; (b) further develop and improve the Site and Applications; (c) send you updates, promotions, offerings, or other news of/about the Site, Applications and/or Stratasys; (d) respond to communications with you; (e) identify or authenticate your access and use of the Site or an Application; and/or (f) send you updates and marketing information related to our products and services. 

  * 4.2.

Transfer To Affiliates. We may send or otherwise share Personal Information to/with our local or foreign subsidiaries or affiliates for the purpose of storing such information on our behalf, or for other processing needs. These entities may be located in other countries to Stratasys, and their servers may be located anywhere in the world. We require these entities to agree to process such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

  * 4.3.

Transfer To Third Parties. We send or otherwise share Personal Information to/with various third parties that help us with our business operations and help us understand how our users use the Site and Applications, and to develop and improve them. These third parties may have their own privacy policies that they adhere to, so they won't necessarily adhere to this Privacy Policy; however, we do try to engage third parties that post a privacy policy. Also, just as with our third party hosting providers, these third parties may be based (and their servers may be located) anywhere in the world. 

  * 4.4.

Enforcement. We may send or otherwise share your Personal Information with any third party if we believe that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (b) enforce the terms of service/use governing the Site and/or Applications, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; and/or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Stratasys, our subsidiary and affiliates entities, our users, yourself, or the public. 

  * 5.

Publicly Available Information. Any content that you make publicly available on or via the Site or Applications (such as your Public Profile) will be publicly available to other users of the Site or such Applications. If you actively or passively allow your contact information to be public, you may receive unsolicited messages or activity from other users of the Site or such Applications. We therefore encourage you only to post information that you are sure you want to be publicly accessible. 

  * 6.

**Opting Out.** You may choose not to receive future promotional, advertising, or other Site- or Application-related emails from us by selecting an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email that we send. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving the foregoing emails, we may still respond to communications initiated by you, as well as send administrative emails that are necessary to facilitate your use of the Site and/or Applications (for example, emails confirming print completion). 

  * 7.

**Access and Accuracy.** We would like to maintain accurate Personal Information. If you would like to delete or correct any of your Personal Information that we may be storing, there may be tools that we make available via the Services. Otherwise, please contact us at [support@grabcad.com](mailto:%20support@grabcad.com) to request deletion containing adequate details of the request (although we do not undertake to respond to, or otherwise implement, the request within any specific period of time). Please be aware that information deleted (whether directly by you or pursuant to a delete request) may or may not be permanently deleted, and may remain stored on our servers (or those of our third party service providers). In such cases, the information will no longer be accessible to you. We, at our discretion, decide whether or not to permanently delete information from our servers. 

  * 8.

**Links to and Interaction with Third Party Products.** The Services may link to, or otherwise enable you to interact with, third party content, products and services. Any Personal Information you provide in connection therewith is provided to the third party. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties, or for such content, products and services, and we encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of each third party that you choose to use or interact with. 

  * 9.

**Children’s Privacy.** The Services are not structured to attract children under the age of 13 years. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 years, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any such information, please contact us at [support@grabcad.com](mailto:%20support@grabcad.com). 

  * 10.

**Security.** We use administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect Personal Information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we try to use reasonably acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or confidentiality. If you have any questions about security on the Site or an Application, you can contact us at [support@grabcad.com](mailto:%20support@grabcad.com). 

  * 11.

**Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy.** In the event that Stratasys is acquired by, or merged with, a third party entity, we may (and hereby reserve the right to) transfer or assign the Personal Information and other information we have collected or received. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or comparable event, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, assigned, or used. 

  * 12.

**California Privacy Rights.** California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure (if any) of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To the extent applicable, you may make such a request by sending an email to [support@grabcad.com](mailto:%20support@grabcad.com). Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year. 

  * 13.

**Our "Do Not Track" Notice.** We do not currently respond or take any action with respect to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of Personal Information about that individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. We may allow third parties, such as companies that provide us with analytics tools, to collect Personal Information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different web sites when a consumer uses the Site and/or an Application. 

  * 14.

**Deletion of Content from California Residents.** If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and a registered user of certain parts of the Services, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to remove content or Personal Information you have publicly posted. If you wish to remove such content or Personal Information, please contact [support@grabcad.com](mailto:%20support@grabcad.com), and provided you specify which content or Personal Information you wish to be removed, we will do so in accordance with applicable law. Please be aware that after removal you will not be able to restore removed content or Personal Information. In addition, such removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or Personal Information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require (or allow) us to enable removal. 

  * 15.

**Commitment.** Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and we try to evolve our Site and Applications to meet these demands. If you have any comments or questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [support@grabcad.com](mailto:%20support@grabcad.com).
