**COOKIES**

**1\. What are Cookies?**

Cookies are small text strings that sites you visit send to your terminal (usually your browser), where they are stored and then retransmitted to the same sites the next time you visit them. While browsing a site, the user can also receive on his terminal cookies that are sent by different websites or web servers (so-called “third parties”), on which may reside some elements (such as, for example, images, maps, sounds, specific links to pages of other domains) on the site that the same person is visiting. Cookies, which are usually present in a very large number of users’ browsers and sometimes have features that allow them to last a long time, are used for different purposes: performing computer authentication, monitoring sessions, storing information on specific configurations regarding users accessing the server, etc..

**2\. Which are the main types of Cookies?**

In this regard, and for the purposes of measure no. 229/2014 of the Privacy Guarantor, two macro-categories have therefore been identified: “technical” cookies and “profiling” cookies.

a. Technical cookies. Technical cookies are those used solely for the purpose of “carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or to the extent strictly necessary to the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide that service” (see Article 122, paragraph 1, of the Privacy Code). They are not used for any further purpose and are normally installed directly by the owner or operator of the website. They can be divided into navigation or session cookies, which ensure normal navigation and use of the website (allowing, for example, to make a purchase or authenticate to access restricted areas); analytics cookies, similar to technical cookies when used directly by the site operator to collect information, in aggregate, on the number of users and how they visit the site itself; functionality cookies, which allow the user to navigate according to a series of selected criteria (such as language, products selected for purchase) in order to improve the service provided to the same. The installation of such cookies does not require the prior consent of users.

b. Proliferation cookies. Proliferation cookies are used to create user profiles and to send advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the user when browsing the web. Due to the particular intrusiveness that such devices may have within the privacy of users, European and Italian law requires that the user must be adequately informed about the use of the same and thus express their valid consent. Our site does not use specific cookies to profile you.

**Session and Persistent Cookies.**

The Session Cookies, which contain the information that is used in your current browser session. These cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Nothing is stored on your computer beyond the time you use the site.

Persistent Cookies, which are used to maintain the information that is used in the period between different accesses to the website, or used for technical purposes and to improve navigation on the site. This data allows sites to identify you as a user or visitor already known and adapts accordingly. Persistent” cookies have a longevity that is set by the website and that can vary from a few minutes to several years. Our site does not use this type of cookie. The anti-tracing setting of any browser does not affect the browsing of our site.

**First party and third party cookies.**

It is necessary to take into account the different party that installs the cookies on the user’s terminal, depending on whether it is the same operator of the site that the user is visiting (the so-called “first party”) or a different site that installs cookies through the first (the so-called “third party”). The first part Cookies are created and can be read by the site that created them. Third party cookies, on the other hand, are created and can be read by domains outside the site and the data are stored by the third party. This site uses first-party cookies of a technical nature, so, as mentioned, consent is not required, only this notice is.
