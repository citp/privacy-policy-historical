By registering for online auctions with GraysOnline, you consent to the use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this privacy statement. 

**1\. Why do I need to supply personal information to participate in online auction?**   
GraysOnline requires your personal information in order that we can process your online bids including processing payment of amounts to us if you are the Winning Bidder. You can also register with us to tell us auctions you are interested in. Naturally, you must be a registered customer prior to placing any online bids for an auction with GraysOnline. You can view all online auctions at any time, but you will need to register before you can bid at an online auction. We also require personal information to improve the service we provide to you, such as by giving you details of auctions you might be interested in. 

**2\. When is personal information collected?**  
There are three areas on the site where you may enter and submit personal information. The first area is the Online Auction Registration Form that will need to be completed prior to placing an online bid at an auction. The second area is your Profile where you can modify or update some of your personal information such as the delivery address for your purchases or your telephone contact number. The third area is Graymail where you provide your details of auctions in which you may be interested.

We will also collect information when you submit an online bid at an online auction (such as what you are bidding for and how much you bid). In addition, the GraysOnline server automatically collects certain information about your use of our service. The information collected in each case is described under section 4 below. 

**3\. Are my personal details safe when being transmitted to you?**  
All transmission of personal information is protected using SSL encrypted transmission between your Web browser and our Web server. You will know when transmitted data is safe by a security notice when you enter a secure page, and by the presence of an icon on your browser, either a key for Netscape or a lock for Microsoft Internet Explorer. The pages where you submit your account information, place a bid, and receive confirmation of a successful bid are all covered by our strong security measures. Additionally, secure web pages can be identified by the URL. A standard page will begin with 'http://' where as a secure web page will begin with 'https://'. 

**4\. What personal information is collected?**   
The GraysOnline Online Auction Registration Form requires potential bidders at an online auction to provide: 

  1. their contact details and billing information (such as name, password/login, address, e-mail address, delivery and billing address), credit card details and expiry date. 
  2. demographic information such as gender and date of birth 
  3. purchasing preferences
  4. miscellaneous information such as how you heard about us, whether your purchase is for personal or business use and where you are connected to the web.   


  
Again, we stress that this information is transmitted from your Web Browser to our Web server in a secure encrypted format to ensure that your privacy is protected. If the information under 4(a) is not provided then we will be unable to process your bids at an online auction or contact you when items of interest to you come up for auction. 

As stated above, we will also collect information about the bids you submit for our online auctions such as what you are bidding for, how much you bid, quantity of goods you are bidding for, plus payment if you are the winning bidder. 

If you send us correspondence we may also collect this and keep it on your account file. 

The GraysOnline server automatically collects additional information about your use of our service. This information can be described as "navigational data" and comprises: browser type; IP address; the URL you come from and go to; links to other sites you click on; the pages you view on our site and time spent on it; cookies; your domain type and service provider. It is standard for many sites to collect this type of information in order to enable them to monitor usage of a site and improve site content and navigation. 

When a GraysOnline web page is requested and viewed, that request is logged on our servers with information including the IP address of the computer that requested the page. An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique string of numbers that identifies a computer or server on the Internet. These numbers are normally shown in groups separated by periods. Your IP address is stored in our bidder database whenever you place a bid, and may be used for various purposes including:-   
\- To increase the level of customer security. IP addresses can be used to validate your bids.   
\- Diagnose service or system problems reported by our users that may be associated with IP addresses controlled by a specific Internet Service Provider (ISP) 

**5\. Where will my personal information be used?**  
Personal information such as contact details and billing information is collected in order that we can efficiently process your bids at online auctions. 

We also want to make your experience online a satisfying and safe one by making it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. We therefore ask you to provide other personal information such as purchasing preferences and demographic data. Naturally, we want you to come back and visit us regularly, so we use the data you supply to us, and your bidding history at online auctions to tailor the content we display to you according to your preferences. We may also use it to advise you when certain items of interest to you come up for bidding at auction. Should you so choose, you can opt-out of receiving communications from us at any time, by visiting the "My Info" section, and follow the instructions to unsubscribe.

Navigational data collected by our system that identifies you personally will not be used. Rather, GraysOnline may combine navigational data and use the aggregated results (i.e. results which do not identify any individual) in order to create a better online experience for you. We do this by using the aggregated data to monitor site usage, for marketing to banner advertisers and to improve the look, content and navigation of the site. 

**6\. Will my personal information be given to anyone else?**  
Our warehouse does supply your name, delivery address and telephone number to our courier for the dispatch of your purchases, but we require them to keep this information confidential. In addition, your details may be passed on to third parties where necessary, for the purpose of processing and collecting any amounts which may become payable by you to us. 

Your initials and the name of your suburb and state are disclosed while you are bidding in an online auction. The reason for this disclosure is to allow actual and potential bidders to track the bidding for particular items at online auctions. 

GraysOnline uses cookies to keep track of your bidding. These cookies are placed in your browser file on your hard drive and help us collect general information about visitor behaviour on our site, track password functions and to help us develop better functionality within our site. Cookies do not capture or track any personal information and cannot identify individual users. We may also use an outside advertising company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our advertising company, and GraysOnline does not have access to, or control over, this information.

**7\. How will GraysOnline keep my personal information safe?**   
The most important thing to remember here is to always keep your GraysOnline login and password secret. Never give your login and password to anyone. GraysOnline encrypts the transmission of personal data between your Web browser and our Web server so information remains secure when sent to us. Additionally, personal information received from you is stored in a system that is not connected to the Internet and is not accessible in any way. GraysOnline operates with a VeriSign Digital Server Certificate, featuring today's state of the art cryptographic techniques to ensure that Digital ID's are not forged or tampered with. 

**8\. Can I correct or update my personal information?**  
Once you have registered for online auctions with GraysOnline, you may at anytime access and modify the personal information you provided in the Registration Form by visiting [My Info](https://www.graysonline.com.au/app/myinfo/). This includes updating your delivery address to ensure items are sent to the correct location or providing an updated contact telephone number should we need to contact you regarding delivery as well as altering your credit and details. 

In order to ensure that we can provide you with the most efficient service we ask that you alter your profile, if necessary, before submitting further online bids for online auctions. You can also add or delete or alter your purchase preferences so that we can provide you with a better service. The My Info section of the GraysOnline web site will also allow you to review other information such as your bidding history at online auction. 

GraysOnline will also take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer required or if you ask us to do so because you no longer intend to use our site. However, due to technical and accounting constraints your personal information may not be completely destroyed. GraysOnline may also need to retain personal information in order to fulfil legal responsibilities or resolve disputes which may arise.
