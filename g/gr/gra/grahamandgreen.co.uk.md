#####  Privacy & Security

The Graham and Green website ('site') is a UK-based website and is in accordance with the requirements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 relating to the personal information you supply on the Site. The Site uses a security system that protects your information from unauthorised use.

Every time you enter an area of the site that has or requires sensitive information such as your credit card details, an icon at the bottom of your browser window will appear that looks like a padlock, indication that the site is secure: 

Another indicator that your page is secure is that the “https” will replace the “http” url. Graham & Green Online uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Private Communications Technology security standards that are supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later and other popular browsers. SSL encodes your personal information and all your transactions are protected by this powerful SSL encryption technology. SSL encrypts your credit card number, name, address, phone number, identification number and password as it travels through the Internet, so that it cannot be read by anyone other than the secure server.

We will not sell, distribute or disclose information about you as an individual or your personal usage of the site without your consent or unless required or permitted to do so by law.

We provide links to other sites, which may not be governed by this Privacy Policy.

We would like you to keep the information about you up-to-date. You may change any of the basic information we keep about you at any time by sending us an e-mail to [websupport@grahamandgreen.co.uk](mailto:websupport@grahamandgreen.co.uk) or by going to our mailing list link.

In addition to the information which you supply to us, information and data may be automatically collected through the use of cookies. Cookies are small text files the site can use to recognise repeat users and allow us to observe behaviour and compile aggregate data in order to improve the site for you. 

We may monitor customer traffic patterns, site usage and related site information in order to optimise your use of the site and we may give aggregated statistics to a reputable third-party, but these statistics will include no information personally identifying you.

We continually strive to improve our standards of customer care at Graham & Green, and in order to help us with training of new or old members of the call centre team we sometimes monitor and record our incoming calls.
