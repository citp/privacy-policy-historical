# Privacy Policy

_Last Modified: June 18, 2012_

  


GRAPHISOFT SE (registered address: 1031 Budapest (GRAPHISOFT park), Záhony u 7, Hungary; hereinafter referred to as “GRAPHISOFT”) is constantly striving to provide excellent service to its customers and business partners, while building a long-lasting relationship. To achieve these goals, GRAPHISOFT occasionally needs information about visitors of the sites operated by GRAPHISOFT (hereinafter referred to collectively as the „Sites” and individually as the „Site”).

GRAPHISOFT respects the privacy of the visitors and users of its Sites so when visiting any of the Sites, visitors may be providing information about their visit to GRAPHISOFT on two different levels: anonymous statistics collected as visitors browse the site, and personal information visitors knowingly give. This document lets know how GRAPHISOFT handles this information. This Policy always applies together with the terms and conditions of each service available through the Sites. The terms and conditions of the services operated through the Sites are available at www.graphisoft.com/licenses.

Please note that some Sites may contain links to sites not operated by GRAPHISOFT. GRAPHISOFT is not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites, and GRAPHISOFT recommends that visitors shall visit the privacy policies of each web site that they visit.

## Types of data collection

### Statistics about the user’s visit

As visitors browse the Site, GRAPHISOFT's Web servers collect information about the visit, not about the visitor personally. Via Web server logs, GRAPHISOFT monitors statistics such as:

  * How many people visit the Site
  * Which pages people visit on the Site
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "yahoo.com" or "aol.com")
  * Which browsers people use to visit the Site



While GRAPHISOFT gathers this information, none of it is associated with the visitor as an individual. GRAPHISOFT uses these statistics to improve its website, to monitor its performance, and to make it easier for users and other visitors to use.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on users’ computer's hard-drive when they visit their websites. Whenever a user requests a page from the website which originally sent the cookie, the user’s browser sends the cookie data back to the website so that the website can detect that the user have been there before. A cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track the pages of the websites the user have visited. This information is stored in a safe and secure database. The user can set his/her browser to block cookies including cookies associated with the Sites. However, it’s important to note that many of the Sites may not function properly if the user’s cookies are disabled. For example, GRAPHISOFT may not remember the user’s language preferences.

### Organizational/personal information the user knowingly gives us

Within the Sites, the user may be asked to register. The registration forms require visitors to give accurate contact information that help GRAPHISOFT better serve users. This information may range from the users zip code, to specific phone number, email address, organization URL and mailing address as set forth on each Site. Users’ name and email address may be used to send information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters or to access special services.

It is also possible to register/log in on the Sites using Facebook / Google and alike accounts. Such registration/logging in only uses the numeric Facebook / Google id and the user’s email address provided by user to his/her Facebook / Google and alike account. All other information that users have made public and is available through the Facebook / Google and alike API is discarded as soon as the user has logged in to the Sites.

Users may always request the Site manager to remove their name and personal data entirely from GRAPHISOFT databases. At certain Sites, this removal may result in the termination of the user’s registration and license.

### How and for what GRAPHISOFT uses the collected information

  * To improve Sites. Information may be collected to help create Web site content and navigation on and among the Sites that is more relevant and user friendly. In scope thereof GRAPHISOFT aims to simplify registration/logging in to Site(s) by applying the data provided by the user during his/her former registration(s)/logging in(s) to (an) other Site(s).
  * To respond to user inquiries and requests for information. This includes registrations for newsletters and a specific request for further information and / or content such as downloads etc.



The information collected shall be stored for the limited period of time strictly necessary to achieve the above purposes or until the user requests the deletion thereof.

GRAPHISOFT does not engage in the practice of selling our customer lists or customer information to third parties. However, we do from time to time engage in joint marketing or other similar arrangements with responsible companies and in the course of such activities may share our customer information with such parties, which sharing may result in communications by such parties to you. This sharing is done solely for the above purposes as a result of our belief that the information communicated to you by such parties will be of interest to you.

GRAPHISOFT has always valued your privacy, and we reinforce this belief throughout our organization. Your information will be protected as described herein unless the specific Site says otherwise. If you have further questions about our privacy policy or if you suspect that a breach of your privacy has occurred; please Contact us.

### General provisions

By using the particular Site in any ways you accept this Policy and approve the data handlings regulated herein. GRAPHISOFT may revise this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Policy. Continued use of the Sites following any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.

The validity, interpretation and performance of this Privacy Policy and any dispute connected herewith shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Hungary. The Hungarian ordinary courts have exclusive jurisdiction in subjects of any legal disputes arising from or in connection with this Privacy Policy.
