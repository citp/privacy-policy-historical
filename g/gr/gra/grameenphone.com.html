</p>
<ul class="default-bullet">
<li>We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies. </li>

</p>

<h4>Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information </h4>

</p>

<h4>Security </h4>
<p>
Your information is stored on our servers in a secured location of Grameenphone Ltd.

However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 
</p>

<h4>Third Parties</h4>
