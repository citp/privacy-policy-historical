    <h3>5.1. Marketing and business development purposes</h3>
    <p>
        Apart from using your personal information to process any orders you may place, if you provide Nature Delivered

        time, we may also contact you by post with information on special offers or events regarding our products or 
        services or those of trusted third parties that we think you may be interested in. If you do not wish to receive 
        updates or marketing information, please amend your mailing preferences in the My Account section. 
    </p>


    <p>
        If you do not object to receiving marketing material at the time the information was collected from you, but 
        subsequently change your mind and no longer wish to receive such information, you may opt out of doing so. If 
        you opt out you may continue to receive information for up to 7 days after the date on which you update your 
        account.

    <p>
        If you start to set up an account with Nature Delivered Ltd. via the website (www.graze.com) but do not complete the 
        process or place any orders, then we will email you to find out if you need any help to complete the process.  
        An unsubscribe link is given at then end of this email. You may also unsubscribe from emails via the following URL:
        <a href="http://www.graze.com/email/unsubscribe/e/">www.graze.com/email/unsubscribe/e/</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition, we may use an IP address to identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you, 
        which we will use to assist in the detection of fraud, to help identify problems with our server and to administer 
        our website.
