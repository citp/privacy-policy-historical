        <h2>What We Use Your Information For</h2>

        <div>
            The principal purposes for which we collect and store your personal information are to process your orders 
            and deliver boxes, authorise payment, bill you, respond to your enquiries, get in touch with you about 
            other products and promotional offers, recommend products which we think might be of interest to you, and 
            generally maintain the account you hold with us, together with improving our website. 
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>Marketing and business development purposes</p>

            Apart from using your personal information to process any orders you may place, if you provide Nature Delivered 
            Ltd with an email address, it will automatically be entered into our regular email update service. From time to 
            time, we may also contact you by post with information on special offers or events regarding our products or 
            services or those of trusted third parties that we think you may be interested in. If you do not wish to receive 
            updates or marketing information, please amend your mailing preferences in the My Account section. 
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <div>
            If you do not object to receiving marketing material at the time the information was collected from you, but 
            subsequently change your mind and no longer wish to receive such information, you may opt out of doing so. If 
            you opt out you may continue to receive information for up to 7 days after the date on which you update your 
            account.
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <div>
            In addition, we may use an IP address to identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you, 
            which we will use to assist in the detection of fraud, to help identify problems with our server and to administer 
            our website.
