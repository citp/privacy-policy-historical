<p>Your personal information is being processed by Haymarket  Media Group ('Haymarket'). For a full list of our brands and business divisions  please visit our <a href="http://www.haymarket.com/brands.aspx" target="_blank">web site</a>.  Haymarket respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal  information. We comply with the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998 and  aim to maintain consistently high levels of best practice in our processing of  your personal information. This Privacy Notice relates to our use of any  personal information you provide to us through the Haymarket network of  websites and/or other services provided by Haymarket.</p>
<p>  In order to provide you with the full range of services, we  may request and/or record information about you. This privacy notice explains  the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>the type of information we       collect;</li>
<li>how the information is       used;</li>
<li>when we may contact you;</li>
<li>whether we will disclose       your details to anyone else; and</li>
<li>the use of cookies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many Haymarket websites contain hyperlinks to websites owned  and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own  privacy notices and we encourage you to review them. We do not accept any  responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party  websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong><em>2. What type of  personal information is collected?</em></strong></p>
<p>When you sign up to participate in or receive a service from  any Haymarket website, such as a newsletter, competition, forum we will ask for  limited personal information. We will also collect personal information from  you when you subscribe to one of our magazines and when you communicate with us  over the telephone or via written correspondence. This can include information  such as your name, postal address, telephone or mobile number, fax number,  email address, gender or date of birth. Different Haymarket websites may ask  for different pieces of personal information. By entering your details in the  fields requested, you enable Haymarket and its service providers to provide you  with the services you select.</p>
<p><strong><em>3. How will the  information be used?</em></strong></p>
<p>Haymarket will use your personal information for a number of  non-marketing purposes including the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>we may contact you for service       related reasons that you have subscribed to, signed up for, or participate       in (e.g. to make you aware of any delays in your subscription arriving on       time, reminding you of a password or username, or about a comment you have       made on a website.);</li>
<li>to invite you to share       your opinions and comments through a research study about the level of       service you receive from us;</li>
<li>to track traffic flows and       to make our websites easier for you to use;</li>
<li>to fulfil subscription       orders;</li>
<li>to provide a user online       community; and for</li>
<li>planning and managing our       business activities by understanding aggregated analysis on behaviour and       habits;</li>
</ol>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of  our group which includes our subsidiaries as defined in section 1159 of the Companies  Act 2006</p>
<p><strong><em>4. Will I be  contacted for marketing purposes?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Haymarket may use the information you have provided to  promote the products and services of Haymarket or others.</p>
<p>  However, be assured that we understand the irritations of  unsolicited communications and are fully committed to ensuring the rights and  obligations set out in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and  Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 are respected.</p>
<p><strong>If you don’t want it,  you won’t get it</strong>.&nbsp; Any marketing  communication you receive will always include a clear, simple option to refuse,  or ‘opt-out’ of such future communications. You may also opt-out at ANY time by  contacting us (see below).</p>
<p>The Telephone Preference Service (TPS) and the Mailing  Preference Service (MPS) offer consumers important statutory and non-statutory  protection against unsolicited marketing contact. If you are registered on  either service, Haymarket will assume that your <em>subsequent</em> submission of personal data via a Haymarket website or  data capture form indicates, for the time being, your consent to receive  marketing by us.<strong> You may opt-out at ANY  time by contacting us (see below).</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>5. Will Haymarket  share my information with anyone else?</em></strong></p>
<p>  Haymarket may disclose your personal data where it believes  it is compelled to do so by law; in particular for the prevention or detection  of crime, the capture or prosecution of offenders; and the assessment or  collection of tax or duty.</p>
<p> Occasionally, we may share your contact information with  carefully selected third party companies whose products and services we feel  may be of interest to you. We will keep these offers relevant to your  interests. It's easy to unsubscribe from any email or mobile messages you no  longer want. (see below).</p>
<p> We use a number of third party organisations to help provide  a professional service to our customers (i.e. fulfilment bureaus, call centres,  and website designers). These organizations act as data processors and are  strictly controlled in how they may/may not use your personal data. We remain  responsible for the protection of your data.<br>
  Please note that some of our partners may be located outside  the European Economic Area (EEA). Countries outside the EEA may not be required  to protect personal information as stringently as countries inside.</p>
<p>  <strong><em>6. Can I find out  what personal information Haymarket holds on me?</em></strong></p>
<p>  Under the Data Protection Act 1998 you have the right to  request a copy of the personal information that Haymarket holds about you.  There will be an administration fee of £10 associated with this request and  will require two pieces of identification to prove your identity. Please make a  written application to the Data Protection Officer, Haymarket Media Group,  Teddington, Middlesex, TW11 9BE.</p>
<p> If any of the personal information that we hold about you is  incorrect, you can click on the contact us link on each website. If the  incorrect information relates to your magazine subscription, then you can  contact the customers services team on 08456 777 800 who will update your  details as soon as practically possible.</p>
