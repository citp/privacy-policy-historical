The original of this Privacy Statement is written in the English language. In the event of any conflict between the English and other language versions, the English version shall prevail.

**_ADDENDUM 1: GRAB FOR BUSINESS_**

**I. **    **INTERPRETATION**

All capitalised terms but undefined terms used herein shall bear the same meaning as those defined in the Terms of Use and the Grab Privacy Policy (accessible at https://www.grab.com/sg/privacy/).

This Addendum forms part of the Grab Privacy Policy. In the event of any inconsistency between the Grab Privacy Policy and this Addendum, this Addendum shall prevail.

**II. **    **GRAB’S RELATIONSHIP WITH USERS AND CLIENTS**

 ** _How Grab for Business works_**

Grab for Business is provided as an add-on feature to facilitate corporate billing for the Authorised Users’ use of Grab’s Services in the course of work.

When an organisation (“ **Client** ”) chooses to utilise Grab for Business, the Authorised User is given the option of tagging his/her rides or other transactions to the Client or to tag it as a personal ride. An Authorised User is referred to in the Grab Privacy Policy as a passenger.

As part of this feature, Grab will disclose detailed trip and booking information that Authorised Users have tagged as being for business purposes to the Client. Apart from this, Grab does not disclose other Personal Data of its Authorised Users to the Client.

Alternatively, an individual user may choose to set up a business profile within the App to facilitate the tagging of business-related rides and to generate consolidated trip reports to facilitate the submission of claims from his or her employer. When used in this mode, the claims process is user-driven and the user’s employer need not be a Client.

For ease of reference, Authorised Users and individual users will each be referred to as a “User” and collectively as “ **Users** ” in this Addendum.

 ** _Grab is a data controller, so are our Clients_**

In respect of any User and the processing of all their Personal Data (including but not limited to Linking Data and Portal Data), **Grab acts as a data controller**. For further information on how Grab collects, uses and discloses Users’ Personal Data, please refer to the Grab Privacy Policy.

Due to the way Grab for Business works, Grab does not process any Personal Data for and on behalf of the Client. Accordingly, **Grab is not the data processor of the Client** , but **an independent data controller** in respect of all Personal Data that it processes in the course of providing the Grab for Business feature. Likewise, the Client is an independent data controller of the Personal Data (e.g. the Linking Data and Portal Data) that it discloses to and/or receives from Grab. 

As independent controllers, Grab and the Client individually determine the purposes and means of processing Personal Data, subject to the provisions set out in the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Grab and the Client are also individually responsible to ensure the protection of Personal Data under their charge. 

**III. **    **WHAT PERSONAL DATA IS COLLECTED, PROCESSED AND DISCLOSED**

 ** _What Grab collects as part of Grab for Business_**

In order to provide the Grab for Business feature, the individual user or the Client will be required to provide the following information about the Authorised User to Grab:

  * full name;
  * business email address; and
  * other identifying information about the Authorised User as reasonably requested by Grab.



Grab will use this information for the purposes of:

  * authenticating the User;
  * where applicable, linking the Authorised User’s account with the Client’s Grab for Business account or tracking the Authorised User’s business profile bookings on the Apps, as the case may be;
  * where applicable, verifying the Corporate Billing status of such Authorised User from time to time; and
  * contacting the User in accordance with the purposes set out in the Grab Privacy Policy.



Upon onboarding such User to the App, Grab will process the Personal Data of the User in accordance with the Grab Privacy Policy and this Addendum.

 ** _What Grab discloses to its Clients_**

Grab will disclose relevant trip and booking information as determined by Grab from time to time to the Client to facilitate Corporate Billing.

 ** _What Grab discloses to its individual user_**

Depending on the business profile settings selected by the individual user, the user may retrieve and generate reports containing his/her relevant trip and booking information.

**IV. **    **PARTIES’ OBLIGATIONS**

The Client and Grab shall each:

  * individually inform their data subjects of how each processes Personal Data and allow their data subjects to exercise their rights under the local data protection/data privacy laws;
  * comply with the obligations applicable to each party under the applicable data protection/data privacy laws when processing any Personal Data of the Proposed or Authorised Users;
  * obtain the necessary consents (if applicable) to facilitate the provision of the Grab for Business feature; and
  * implement appropriate legal, technical and organisational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against unauthorised loss, destruction, damage, alteration, or disclosure, as well as any breach or attempted breach of each party’s security measures (“ **Information Security Incident** ”).
