# Graces Guide:Privacy policy

**IP and other technical information**

When a visitor requests or reads a page, or sends email to our server, no more information is collected than is typically collected by other web sites. Grace's Guide may keep raw logs of such transactions, but these will not be published or used to track legitimate users. 

When a page is edited by a logged-in editor, the server confidentially stores related IP information for a limited period of time. This information is automatically deleted after a set period. 

**Cookies**

The sites set a temporary session cookie on a visitor's computer whenever a page is visted. Readers who do not intend to log in or edit may deny this cookie; it will be deleted at the end of the browser's session. 

More cookies may be set when one logs in to maintain logged-in status. If one saves a user name or password in one's browser, that information will be saved for up to 30 days, and this information will be resent to the server on every visit to the same Project. 

Contributors using a public machine who do not wish to show their username to future users of the machine should clear these cookies after use
