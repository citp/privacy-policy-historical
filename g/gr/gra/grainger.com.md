  * **Keep Your User ID and Password Secure**  
To enhance your online safety, keep your personal information private: 
    * Never reveal your password to anyone
    * Change your password periodically
  * **Protect Your Account from Online Fraud**  
Often called “spoofing” or “phishing”, the most current methods of online fraud are fake emails, Web sites and pop-up windows, or any combination of these.

Spoof emails are phony emails, which appear to have originated from a legitimate company. These phony emails ask you to go to a spoof Web site and provide your personal account information. To bait you, often these deceptive emails may allude to an urgent matter concerning your account. 

In many cases these is no easy way to determine that you are on a phony Web site because the URL may contain the name of the company it is spoofing. However, if you type, or cut and paste the URL into a new Web browser window and it does not take you to a legitimate Web site, or you get an error message, it was probably just a cover for a fake Web site.




**Security Tips:**

  * Delete suspicious emails without opening them. If you do open a suspicious email, never click on a link or open an attachment contained in the suspicious email.
  * Do not provide your sensitive information by email or phone unless you initiated the contact.
