# Grab | Privacy Policy

At Grab Media ("Grab Media," "we" or "us"), we know that every user ("You" or "Your") of the Internet is concerned about privacy, so we developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information about users of our website located at [www.grab-media.com](http://www.grab-media.com/) (the "Site"). As a guiding principal, our mission at Grab Media is to provide our users with access to a wide selection of enjoyable, interesting, and entertaining videos (we call that our "Service"), and we hope your experience on our Site and Service is enjoyable. In order to provide this Service and to optimize the Site, we may collect information about You as described below in this Privacy Policy. Read on and we will tell You how this all works.

By using the Site, You are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. Each time You visit the Site and any time You voluntarily provide us with information, You agree that You are consenting to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that You provide, and You are consenting to receive emails or otherwise be contacted, as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into Grab Media's Terms of Use. If a term is capitalized and not defined in this Privacy Policy, it is defined in Grab Media's Terms of Use. Whether or not you register or create any kind of account with Grab Media, this Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Site.

INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT LAWS IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE THAT INFORMATION IS PROCESSED MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE LAWS WHERE YOU LIVE.

So that we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we mean information about You that is personally identifiable to You, like Your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number. When we use the phrase "Non-Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to Your Personal Information. Non-Personal Information does not enable identification of or contact with individual persons.

### Our Information Collection Through Third-Party Sites

In addition to operating the Site, Grab Media is in the business of making videos available to its numerous business partners, who include those videos within their own websites. In connection with delivering videos or advertisements to those websites, we may collect information from the end users of those websites. If we do, our collection, use and disclosure of information will be performed as described in this Privacy Policy, in the same manner as if the information were collected through the Site.

### Children

The Site is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 18 years of age, and no part of our Site or Service is designed to attract people under 18 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 18 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and the Service.

### How We Collect Information

We do not collect Personal Information from You unless you voluntarily provide it to us.

From time to time we may request optional information to support Your access to the Site or Services. For example, when You sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to You, we may collect Your email address and other information related to your request. When You communicate with us by sending us an email, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys or contest entries, we will collect any information that is contained in Your communications with us. In generally, it is not necessary to provide Us Your Personal Information in order to use most features of the Site, and You can choose not to provide us with any particular Personal Information, but please be aware that this may limit the features of the Site or Services You are able to use.

### Information Collected Via Technology

As You use the Site or Services, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers' server logs, including Your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We may also use Cookies, Web beacons, and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of Your visit and the information You viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Site You clicked. This type of information is collected to make the Site or Services and solutions more useful to You and to tailor the experience with the Site or Services to meet Your special interests and needs.

An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer when You use the Internet. In some cases Your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if You use a consumer internet access provider, Your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We, or our service providers, may track Your IP Address when You access the Site or Services.

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to Your computer's hard drive while You are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once You close Your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on Your computer until You delete them) to provide You with a more personal and interactive experience with the Site or Services. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Your Internet browser help file directions. If You choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Site or Services may not work properly.

"Web Beacons" (sometimes also known as "Web bugs" or clear GIFs) take two forms. The first form of Web Beacon is a small, usually transparent image within a Web page. At the time Your computer downloads the image, the HTML code of that page is capable of passing along certain information. The second form of Web beacon is a short script of code that is loaded within your browser at the time Your computer plays a video. The browser runs this script, making it capable of passing along certain information. The types of information collected by a Web beacon may include the IP address of the computer retrieving the image or playing the video, the browser type used to retrieve the image or play the video, the time when the image or video was retrieved or played, and the values contained within previously set Cookies. If You disable Cookies in your browser, Web Beacons will be unable to track Your specific use of the Site, but some areas of the Site or Services may not work properly.

We may contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. For example, we may use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Site. To do this, we may use Cookies and Web beacons provided by our partners on this Site. We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on the Site. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or Web beacons in order to monitor information related to advertisements. Advertisers we support in this way include AudienceScience, Inc. who collects information on behalf of P&G. The information collected helps our advertisers, our third party partners and us learn things like what kinds of customers our Site attracts, which of our advertisers' products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Please be aware that clicking on advertisements for third parties' products and services will direct You to the website of a third-party and/or the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.

### Information From Other Sources

We may receive Personal Information about You from other sources like telephone, fax or email, from third-parties that provide services for us in connection with the Site or Services, as well as from other users and third parties to whom You have voluntarily provided information. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from You via the Site or Services. This Privacy Policy does not restrict our use of that additional information.

### Third-Party Websites

The ability to access information of third-parties from the Site or Services, or links to other websites or locations, is for Your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such third-parties, their services, other websites, locations or their contents.

If You provide your email address to us, You consent to our contacting You using that email address, until such time as you expressly instruct us that You no longer with to receive such communications.

We may use Non-Personal Information to analyze usage patterns so that we may enhance the Site or Services. We reserve the right to use and disclose Non-Personal Information to third-parties in our discretion.

### Use Of Information For Behavioral Advertising

Grab Media uses information collected from end users of the Site, as well as information that we collect from end users of the numerous websites where we deliver videos, to develop profiles of end users for purposes of selecting the advertisements that we display, sometimes known as "behavioral advertising."

We may disclose information collected for purposes of behavioral advertising to advertisers (including AudienceScience who collects information on behalf of P&G), to the third parties who operate the websites through which we collected the information, or to other third parties in connection with behavioral advertising. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to our collection, use and disclosure of information for behavioral advertising purposes. You may withdraw your consent or modify your preferences regarding our information collection and use of your information for such purposes by indicating your preferences at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices.](http://www.aboutads.info/choices)

We may disclose Your Personal Information, including Payment Information:
