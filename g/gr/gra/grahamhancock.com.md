### Definitions

A cookie is a piece of information that a website asks your browser to store on your computer. The website can then request this information back to provide you with a customised page. It is used to link the current surfing session to an earlier one. The ticket you get from a dry-cleaning shop is a perfect mundane example of a cookie; the only thing it’s useful for is to relate a later transaction to this one (so you get the same clothes back).
