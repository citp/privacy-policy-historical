## Who we might share your data with?

### Our group of companies

In order to deliver the best possible integrated careers advice and services to you, from time to time we may transfer your personal details between our websites. This may on occasion be across different companies within our group. Before doing so we conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment in order to ensure that any such transfers do not impact your rights. You may object to your data being processed in this manner by contacting us using the details above.

### Our service providers

For the purposes of sending emails and maintaining engagement information we will maintain a secure copy of your personal data with our service partners whom provide the facilities to email users based on their preference criteria and track engagement. Access to this data is strictly controlled and we remain the data controller.

### Employers and sponsors

In addition, the CVs you submit directly to us will be accessible by our Search team (who recruit on behalf of employers) working for our sister company GTI Recruiting Solutions (also known as TARGETrecruit) as well as potential employers.

Along with your CV, personal details contained in your profile might be shared with potential employers where you have expressed an interest in joining or attending one of their careers events or entering their sponsored competition run on their behalf by GTI.

Your profile details (with the exception of any special categories of personal data as defined by Article 9 of the GDPR) including contact information will also be supplied to employers if you have agreed to be contacted directly by the employer or course provider for a particular role, course or event via our direct message functionality. Employers or course providers should only contact you with respect of that particular role or event in each instance, and you have the right to request that the Employer stop contacting you by getting in touch with them directly.

For TARGETjobs events that you have attended we may also share your personal details including your CV with employers at the event so that they may contact you directly about opportunities with them.

### Government, legal or regulatory authorities

GTI may be required to share your personal information with certain public or legal authorities where there is a legislative obligation to do so.

## Automated processing and profiling

We use the information you provide to make automated decisions solely in the capacity of delivering you content based on your stated preferences. Personal data may be matched against potential vacancies in order to provide relevance to the content and information we provide you. However you have at all times access to all available vacancies and may change your preferences to amend what content or vacancies are filtered.

There are no automated decision making processes that would impact you as a result of any automated processing. No judgements or decisions are made of an individual’s suitability for a particular role as a result of any processing that may take place.
