|  What GraphicMail does with the information it gathers/tracks  
  
  | We may use your personal information such as your email address for sending updates or promotions about our company or to contact you if requested or necessary in regards to your account. You may at any time opt out of receiving future mailings by using the unsubscribe link provided on those mailings.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Tracking your browser and screen resolution type help us understand your needs related to our website presentation.

Monitoring the data stored in your account and volume of emails you send allows us to anticipate product usage and ensure we have sufficient infrastructure in place to provide the expected service for our users.  
  
  |    
| With whom this site shares information it gathers/tracks  
  
  | We will not share or sell your personal information or any of the information stored within your account (such as ../Site/Images/, templates and email addresses) with any third parties for their Promotional purposes. We may only disclose such information if that disclosure is required by law to comply with a judicial proceeding or court order.

We may share aggregate statistics about our customer's traffic patterns and reservations with our suppliers and partners, but these statistics do not include any personally identifying information.  
  
  |    
| Security  
  
  | Quattro Internet Solutions DBA GraphicMail will follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We cannot however, guarantee total or absolute security, as no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. As part of our commitment to you the customer, Quattro Internet Solutions DBA GraphicMail will strive to implement and use any commercially acceptable means available to protect your personal information. As such GraphicMail conforms to industry security standards to protect user information form virus attacks and hacking attempts. We use the latest product releases from Microsoft and other companies to ensure our systems always rate well against industry standards. Our operating systems and software are always up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

Firewalls are used extensively to protect data by opening only the necessary channels to the necessary entities on our servers. This means that if a PC or location does not need to have access to our servers for our system to work properly, they will not be able to contact that server. This greatly reduces the chances of hackers being able to penetrate our system. We use the latest anti-virus software to scan our servers in real time against any suspicious files and traffic. Virus definitions are updated multiple times per day.

All our software runs on RAID hard drives to prevent downtime in the event of hardware failure. We also protect our data from hardware failure or disaster events by running daily backups.

All employees sign a privacy agreement when they join GraphicMail that prevents them from using, disclosing or selling any user information.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at [management@graphicmail.com](mailto:management@graphicmail.com).

| WorldPay and Secure Trading  
We use [World Pay](http://www.worldpay.com/) and [Secure Trading](http://www.securetrading.com/) to provide payment services. They are online payment gateways which make subscribing and purchasing quick and easy for our clients. Payment details are encrypted and sent to the payment processing gateway. All payments are linked and identified to a transaction ID, but when a client selects to subscribe for a monthly subscription this subscription is identified and linked to a unique ID. This unique ID is used to initiate recurring payment. Within the unique ID the particulars of the client is viewable such as when the subscription [date, time] was made as well as the client name, address, contact no. and number payments made. 

The information obtained from clients at payment is not stored by GraphicMail. These confidential details [credit card details] are stored only at the Merchant bank (WorldPay and European Merchant Services) therefore GraphicMail does not have access to these details. WorldPay or Secure Trading notifies us of payment failures, warnings and cautionary payments and credit card expires. The link between WorldPay or Secure Trading and GraphicMail will automatically suspend clients when payment has failed and this is done by warning both from WorldPay and GraphicMail. Should the client wish to upgrade or down grade their subscription the existing and present unique ID is cancelled and a new unique ID is allocated to the subscription. Clients can cancel at anytime from directly within the account or by an email request to support@graphicmail.com. The uniuqe ID is then cancelled and this will end all recurring payments.
