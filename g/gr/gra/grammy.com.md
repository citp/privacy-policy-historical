This happens, for example, when a user requests to sign up for a newsletter, to receive our press releases by email, communicate with any of our member services department, or if the user participates in a survey that we conduct through our Platform.

Only the minimum amount of information necessary to operate or manage the account is mandatory. The user may elect to provide additional information, which we use to enhance the Platform, for example by offering access to social media accounts.

Certain areas of the Site are accessible only by Members of the Academy in good standing. To access those areas, a Member must first register on the Platform and select a password. As part of such registration, we may request: first and last name; company or business name; email address **; s** treet address, including country and telephone number.

The information collected in connection with each type of interaction is retained in accordance with our record retention policy, so that we can continue interaction with the requestor with respect to our Platform.

**4.7  Membership Submission and Renewal; Communications with Members**

**New Membership**

Each year, the Academy seeks recommendations from its members and nonmembers regarding the addition of new voting members and professional members.  The process is described [here](mailto:https://www.grammy.com/recording-academy/membership/join). After the recommendations are evaluated, qualified individuals are invited to complete a career profile, which is available on the Platform.  The information requested through this profile and the follow-up interaction with the candidates or the renewing members are intended to help us evaluate each individual’s submission, credentials, and the extent to which an individual’s background, qualifications, achievements, profile and contributions to the music industry meet the criteria for membership in the Academy.  The information collected from these submissions is also used in aggregate for statistical purposes, to evaluate the characteristics of our membership.

**Membership Renewal**

Existing members must requalify periodically, per Academy Membership Rules.  To do so, they must complete online forms available on the Platform.  The information collected is the same as for a new member submission.  It is used and retained in the same manner as the information collected for new membership.

**Student Membership**

Student membership is open to students who are currently enrolled full-time in a college, university or trade school preparing for a career in the recording industry. The process for seeking membership does not require recommendations from industry professionals.  However, the information requested through this profile and the follow-up interaction with the candidates are similarly intended to help us evaluate each individual’s submission, credentials, and the extent to which an individual’s background, qualifications, and achievements meet the criteria for membership in the Academy. 

**Ethnicity**

The online forms used to present a career profile include a field where individuals may elect to indicate the ethnicity to which they relate. The provision of this information is optional. Ethnicity is used to assess the diversity of our membership and ensure that we are reaching out to all members of the music industry.

**_When you elect to provide ethnicity information in a career profile, you provide your explicit consent to the use of this information as described in this section on Membership Submissions.    _**

**_You have the right to withdraw this consent at any time. If you have provided ethnicity information, and decide to make a change, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section._**

**Gender and Age Information**

The online forms used to present a career profile include a field where individuals may elect to indicate their gender and age. The provision of this information is optional. It is used to assess the diversity of our membership and ensure that we are reaching out to all members of the music industry.

You have the right to request that this information be removed from our records at any time.  To do so, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section.

**Aggregate Information**

We examine ethnicity information in the aggregate in the context of new membership  or membership renewal to derive information about the diversity of our membership.  We carefully review these statistics in order to ensure that the composition of each class of new members meets the then-current diversity goals of the music industry.

**Incomplete Submissions**

If an individual initiates a submission but does not complete it, we retain the information provided for a reasonable time, so that we can communicate with the individuals and assist in completing the process as needed.  If a submission is not completed after we have communicated with the individual, or if we have been unable to establish contact, the related information is deleted.  

**Communications with Members**

Once an individual’s submission or membership renewal have been accepted we use the individual’s contact information to communicate on Academy-related business, such as to invite the individual to serve on a committee or attend an event.  In addition, members have the ability to elect to receive newsletters and information about the Academy.

**Recommendations**

Submissions for consideration for membership require that individuals have previously received recommendations from industry professionals.  A person who completes a recommendation for a potential new member is required to provide certain personal information (such as name, address, proof of identity, or proof of eligibility to make a recommendation).  This information is used only for the purpose of assisting in the membership consideration process.  It is retained for auditing purposes and is archived.

**  4.8 Correspondence Sent to Users**

Unless we are prohibited by applicable law from using cookies and a user has not otherwise indicated his/her preference regarding our use of cookies, we insert in some of our correspondence images or links that when viewed or clicked, allow us to know whether the user has accessed or declined to open correspondence. This action may also generate a cookie that allows us to count unique clicks or visits, and potentially track the recipient.

This information helps us understand how the individual reacts to our communications and limit the amount and nature of information provided.

**4.9  Surveys and Contests**

From time-to-time, we invite users to participate in surveys or contests. Participation is voluntary. These surveys are organized for the purposes of our marketing efforts. When a user participates, we request certain personal data such as name and email address.

This is necessary to ensure that responses are categorized properly and are not duplicated. Depending on the nature of the survey or contents, we use this information to send the survey results to the participants, or, if applicable, to notify contest winners and award prizes.

We also use the information in aggregate form, for analytics purposes, to understand our market, to monitor site traffic or app usage, or to modify our Platform to meet the needs or interests of users.

**_If we use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys, the information collected by the service provider may be subject to both the service provider’s privacy policy and ours._** We will provide information about the applicable privacy policies with the Survey rules and will seek your explicit consent to these rules when required by law. You should read the terms of the survey or contest to understand the extent to which the service provider is allowed to use or reuse the information collected.

**11.  Transfers of Personal Data**

Personal Data is collected and processed in several different countries. To ensure the lawfulness of the transfers of personal data across borders, we rely on decisions from the European Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission.

**12.  Security of Personal data**

We use commercially reasonable technical, organizational, and administrative safeguards to protect information within our control against unauthorized or unlawful access, use, modification, destruction, processing or disclosure, and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. We believe that these measures are reasonably adapted to the nature of the information in our custody.

We limit access to our users’ personal data to only those employees and third parties who reasonably need access to it to perform the activities attached to their job responsibilities.

However, due to the realities of data security, no security system or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% effective or secure. Thus, we cannot guarantee that any information provided to us, collected by us or transmitted by us will not be accessed, hacked, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by unauthorized parties.

**12.1  Breach of Security**

If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us might have been compromised), or if you suspect someone else is using your account, please let us know immediately by contacting us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section.

You must promptly notify us if your credit, bank, other financial institution information, username, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will assist you in updating your account details.

**13.  Rights of Individuals**

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants individuals who are in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) the following rights, with some limitations. The Academy extends these rights to all users and members, subject to the limitations set forth in Articles 15 to 23 of the GDPR. Individuals may contact us, at the address provided in the “How to Contact us” section below, to exercise any of those rights and we will respond as defined in the applicable provision(s) of the GDPR.

**13.1  Right Not to Provide Consent or to Withdraw Consent**

We may seek to rely on your consent in order to process certain personal data. Where we do so, you have the right not to provide your consent, and the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing conducted based on consent before its withdrawal.

You have the right to require that we correct any inaccurate personal data concerning you, and that we complete incomplete personal data.

In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we erase personal data concerning you; for example, if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected.

**13.5  Right to Restrict Processing**

In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we restrict the processing of the personal data that we have collected about you; for example, where you believe that the personal data that hold about you is not accurate or lawfully held.

In certain circumstances, you have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided us in a structured, commonly used, machine readable format, and the right to obtain that we transmit the data to another entity where technically feasible.

**13.10  Right to Complain to a Supervisory Authority**

You have the right to lodge complaint with a supervisory authority or other dispute resolution mechanism if you believe that our processing of personal data relating to you infringes your rights under Applicable Law.

**14.  Rights of Users Located in California**

California requires operators of websites or similar services to make certain disclosures to users who reside in California regarding their rights, specifically:

**14.1  Shine the Light**

Under California law, a business that has an established business relationship with an individual, and has, within the immediately preceding calendar year, disclosed personal data that is primarily used for personal, family or household purposes to third party for the third party’s direct marketing purposes, must disclose to its California users, upon request, the identity of any such third party, along with the type of personal data disclosed.

You can contact us to as provided in the “How to Contact Us” section. Please note that under California law, businesses are only required to respond to a user’s request once during any calendar year.

**14.2  Do-Not-Track**

Some browsers give individuals the ability to communicate that they wish not to be tracked while browsing on the Internet. California law requires that we disclose to users how we treat do-not-track requests. The Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what “Do Not Track” means, how compliance with “Do Not Track” would be measured or evaluated, or a common approach to responding to a “Do Not Track” signal. Due to the lack of guidance, we have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals in response to California law.

In the meantime, there are technical means to prevent some of the tracking, if any. See Section “Your Advertising Choices.”

**15.  Privacy Notice Changes**
