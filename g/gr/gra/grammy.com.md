| 

  
We share your concerns about privacy and security, and we assure you that your information is always kept safe and your privacy held in trust. Your information may be shared with certain sponsors of GRAMMY- or Recording Academy-related programs, and we may compare our visitor lists with lists we receive from other companies. However, we do not sell, rent or trade the information you provide to us with anyone else. 

  
We gather information about your preferences to help us personalize and improve our site and bring you the best experience possible. Here is a look at the kinds of information we gather, and how we might apply it.

  
GRAMMY.com may occasionally ask visitors to complete surveys and opinion polls about their interests, needs and attitudes. Surveys help us provide better services and products that meet our member, visitor and customer needs. Participation is completely voluntary and these surveys are optional. 

  
You do not need to provide personal information to access GRAMMY.com. We do not collect personal information about you (such as your name, address, telephone number, email address or credit card) unless you provide it to us. However, you may need to provide some personal information to make a purchase or participate in certain promotions, surveys, or receive information from us. The information you provide helps us improve our site, tailor content to your tastes, and communicate with you more easily. We might use this information to let you know about special offers we think you would be interested in, or let you know about upcoming events or information.

  
We also gather and store information from our e-mail communications with you, to help us deliver the best service possible.

  
By using this website, you signify your acceptance of our Privacy Statement, and you adhere to the terms and conditions posted on the website. This clause is not enforceable in countries of the European Union. Please check back here periodically for changes to this Privacy Statement.
