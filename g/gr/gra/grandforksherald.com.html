<br>
Forum Communications Company&nbsp; is committed to respecting your privacy rights 
when visiting any Forum Communications Company web site, such as this one. To 
protect your personal information, Forum Communications Company has adopted the 
guidelines outlined below.<b><br>
<br>
Information Collected</b><br>
While visiting any of the Forum Communications Company web sites&nbsp; we may 
ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you 
for purposes of interacting with the site. Such personal information may include, 
but is not limited to, your name, phone number, street address and e-mail address. 
On any page that collects personal information, we will specifically describe 
what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service 
or enter you in the promotion you have requested, as well as respond to your inquiry 
or comment.<br>
<br>
<b>What are Cookies?</b> A cookie is an element 
of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on 
your system. This element of data is a piece of text, not a program. The site 
can only access the information from a cookie sent by the site. We cannot access 
other cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained therein. Additionally, 
we cannot learn your e-mail address or any other information about you through 
the use of a cookie. The only way we would learn such information is if you specifically 
and voluntarily submit that information to us, for example, through a registration 
system, by entering a sweepstakes or promotion, etc.<br>
<br>
<b>Why does the site use cookies?</b> Forum Communications Company uses cookies 
to track usage of the site and further personalize your experience when you are 
visiting the site. By tracking usage, we can best determine what features of the 
site best serve the users.<br>
<br>
<b>What benefits do I receive from cookies?</b> Overall, the use of cookies helps 
to give you a more personalized experience at the site. The information is used 
to keep our site fresh and relevant to you the user. Cookies also allow you to 
avoid retyping your e-mail address and password each time you access the site.<br>
<br>
<b>May I decline to accept a cookie?</b> You may decline to accept cookies sent 
by the site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies. However, 
some portions of the site may require registration in order to access those areas. 
In such cases, we ask that you register and provide us with basic information 
on our registration page, or sign in if previously registered. Cookies enable 
our server to know that you are a registered user; and will eliminate the need 
for you to log in each time you access our site. In addition, our registration 
system may require that you accept the cookies from the site in order to access 
that portion of the site. Other sites linked to the site may also send cookies; 
however we do not control such activities.<br>
<br>
<b>What happens with the information collected in a cookie?</b> The information 
stored in a cookie is used to identify you to our server, to allow us to personalize 
your experience on the site, and to serve content and communications that may 
be of interest to you.<br>
<br>
<b>IP Addresses: </b>Forum Communications Company does log IP addresses, or the 
location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting 
purposes and to determine site usage.<br>
<b><br>
Use of Personal Information</b><br>
We believe in protecting your privacy, and will not share personal information 
with third parties outside of Forum Communications Company except as described 
in this Privacy Policy. We believe that we can enhance your experience on our 
site with the information you share with us. We use personal information about 
you to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze 
site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the 
site's content, layout, and services. We may also use your personal information, 
such as your e-mail address or mailing address, to contact you regarding products 
and/or services that may be of interest to you, to respond to an inquiry from 
you regarding the information that we have collected or respond to your comments 
and suggestions.<br>
<br>
Grand Forks Herald will not sell you personal information or user database to outside 
companies, however, we may facilitate delivery of special offers or promotions 
from local businesses which are relevant to our users. All e-mails generated from 
user registration will come from an @forumcomm.com or @in-forum.com address. Forum 
Communications Company may match specific and/or aggregated personal information 
with third party data to provide you with product and content offerings that interest 
you and improve our advertising and marketing efforts. Forum Communications Company 
also may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services 
to potential advertisers, partners, other third parties, our affiliate companies, 
and for other lawful purposes. As part of your experience on our site, you may 
receive communications from us related to products and services that might interest 
you. While we believe these services will enhance your experience at our site, 
you will at all times be able to opt out from receiving these communications, 
either by specifically opting out of these services or by deleting your profile 
from our database.<br>
<br>
We have today, and will in the future have, arrangements with third party service 
providers, such as credit card processors, shipping companies and fulfillment 
services. When you sign up for a service we offer on the site, we may be required 
to share Personal Information with that service provider in order to provide the 
service. These third party providers are not permitted to retain or use personal 
information for any purpose unrelated to providing the service.<br>
<br>
Forum Communications Company may also offer other services as a part of our site 
(e.g., car buying service, personalized finance and weather information alerts, 
contests, sweepstakes and other promotions with unaffiliated third parties). If 
you choose to use these optional services or opportunities, we may provide some 
of your personal information to third parties, such as service providers and other 
parties assisting us in providing the service. We will not do so without telling 
you how we will use that information, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures 
by choosing not to use these services or features of the site.<br>
<br>
We reserve the right to disclose personal information when needed to comply with 
the law or a legal process, cooperate with investigations of purported unlawful 
activities, to identify persons violating the law, or in connection with the sale 
of part or all of Forum Communications Company.<br>
<br>
<b>Party Collecting the Information</b><br>
This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and dissemination of information that 
we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose any information to other 
parties, whether through, for example, on-line auctions, chat rooms, personal 
ads, or the like, through third party services or promotions offered on or through 
the site or through other web sites throughout the Internet, different policies 
may apply and Forum Communications Company shall not be responsible for the use 
or dissemination of such information.<br>
<br>
Our sites may operate as part of a larger group of sites, and may carry co-branded 
pages. In addition, other sites may use the site's or Forum Communications Company's 
name. Since Forum Communications Company does not control the privacy policies 
of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies, if any, 
of such third parties, and Forum Communications Company shall not be responsible 
for the use or dissemination of your private information by such parties. Therefore, 
we encourage you to ask questions and review those parties' privacy policies before 
you disclose your personal information to others.<br>
