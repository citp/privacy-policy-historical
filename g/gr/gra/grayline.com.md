# Privacy Policy

Gray Line Corporation, a Maryland non-stock corporation, knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting web sites owned and/or operated by Gray Line Corporation and/or sites operated by Gray Line Licensees and linked to a site operated by Gray Line, (“Sites”) you are accepting the practices described in this privacy notice.

**About the Gray Line Corporation.**

The Gray Line Corporation (“Gray Line”) has its principal office in Denver, Colorado. As a Maryland non-stock corporation, Gray Line is the owner, and licensor of registered trademarks, trade names, service marks, designs and logos, which are used in connection with sightseeing, charter, transfer, destination management, package tour, attraction ticketing and other travel services (“Services”). Independent businesses operating under License from Gray Line within a geographic territory, known as Licensees, conduct these Services. As such, Gray Line does not itself provide any Services. Rather, it facilitates and communicates content, features, promotions, and the ability to make a reservation and/or purchase tickets for the Licensee providing the Services.

The information we learn from visitors to our Sites helps us personalize and continually improve your user experience. The remainder of this policy describes our information and handling practices in detail.

**When you are just visiting us.**

You can always visit our Sites without revealing who you are or providing any personal information. When you visit our Sites or visit our Sites through one of our independent Licensee sites, we do collect usage information (session data), but it is anonymous and does not link to you as an individual. We use session data to better understand things like how our Sites are being navigated, how many visitors arrive at specific pages, the length and frequency of stays at our Sites, the variety of searches of our Sites’ databases, the types of browsers and computer operating systems used by our visitors and the Internet Protocol addresses from which our visitors connect to our Sitess. We use this information to improve our Sites’ content and ease of use.

Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you can set your browser preferences to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of the Gray Line Sites that are available to the general public, but you may not be able to use certain features designed to enhance your experience or access certain services we may offer.

We may also have third party advertisers ("Advertisers") on the Sites. These Advertisers may use cookies to track session data about the ads you have seen and those you appeared interested in. We do not share any personal information about you with these Advertisers unless you give permission to do so separate from any permission you provide during the registration process or in purchasing tickets. However, these Advertisers may have other sources of information in their own privacy practices.

When you purchase tickets through the Sites, we provide information about you to our independent Licensees, Affiliated Licensees or other involved third parties. Occasionally, Gray Line Corporation will conduct (or use an unrelated third party to act on its behalf for) market research surveys, contest entry processing or other projects.

Gray Line may also disclose user information when it believes, in good faith, that the law requires such disclosure. 

**Affiliated Businesses.**

We work closely with our affiliated partners and Licensees, an example of which is the American Automobile Association ("AAA"). In certain cases, these businesses may offer their own products or services. In the event a Site provides a link to other sites, please note that such sites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. The Gray Line Corporation is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or for the privacy policies and practices of our affiliated partners and Licensees whose sites are not directly linked to a Gray Line operated web Sites.
