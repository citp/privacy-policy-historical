### This policy is intended to help you understand how Graco Children's Products Inc collects, uses and safeguards the information you provide on our website.

#### Personal Data

If you browse any Graco website, you may generally do so anonymously without providing any personal information. However, there are cases in which we may ask you for personal data. For example, we will occasionally conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs and profile of our visitors. In addition, we may request personal information when you register to receive additional information regarding our products and services, sign up for a newsletter, or send us a question. Even if you choose not to give information we request, you can still visit most of the Newell Rubbermaid website, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services.

 In case you change your mind or wish to update or delete personal information (such as your zip code), we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this by contacting us at the contact points specified below. 

#### Orders

When you place an order for a product, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This personal information is required so that we can process and fulfill your order, send an order or shipping confirmation, as well as notify you of your order status. All Internet transactions with Graco Children's Products are performed on a secure server that encrypts your credit card information to ensure it is not read by unauthorized third parties.

If you provide us with personal information, and choose to join our email list, we will e-mail you regarding product updates, special offers, important issues and new products. If you do not wish to receive e-mail updates, please contact us at the contact points specified below.

Personal information provided by users who are 13 or more years of age may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Graco Children's Products and affiliates. Graco Children's Products does not share your personal information entered on this site with third parties, except as outlined in this section.

 The information that you give us (with the exception of your email address) and information about your order may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. This information may also be shared with other marketers to bring you offers of interest. If you prefer that we do not share your name and address with other marketers, please email us at [optout@gracobaby.com](mailto:optout@gracobaby.com). Furthermore, Graco Children Products will not use your e-mail address for marketing purposes unless you expressly opt-in to our e-mail list and we will not share your e-mail address with third parties for promotional purposes, except when you consent to such sharing by explicitly opting in to our partner e-mail list. We may also share your information as required by law. While we use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, Graco Children's Products will have no liability for disclosure of any information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.

#### Special Cases

Graco Children's Products reserves the right to disclose user information in special cases, when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other Graco Children's Products website users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
