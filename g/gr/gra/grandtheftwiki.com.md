# Grand Theft Wiki:Privacy Policy - Grand Theft Wiki, the GTA wiki

  
[Grand Theft Wiki](https://web.archive.org/Grand_Theft_Wiki:About "Grand Theft Wiki:About") is a website to provide and share information about Grand Theft Auto games. Everything we do is to enable us to help provide this service. 

This Privacy Policy is here so you understand how your personal data is used on Grand Theft Wiki, and help you understand your rights. 

## Summary

Grand Theft Wiki is a public wiki, meaning that any content uploaded can be accessed by anybody. This includes all edits to articles, your user page, talk pages and other pages, and all files uploaded. The change history of all files and pages is also publicly accessible. 

For this reason, we recommend you do not share personal information on the site, except what you would like to share on your own user page. Do not add anything you would not want everyone to see. For your profile page, displaying your name, age and location is good; website and email address is up to you; but telephone number and postal address is discouraged. 

We collect some other information from you when you use Grand Theft Wiki, so we can continue to run and improve the site. This is done for logging and understanding our users visits to our website, for identifying technical problems, for providing advertisements, and for providing a richer experience on the site. This can happen when you visit a page, create an account, make an edit, participate in our social media, or contact us. 

We are committed to: 

  * Only using your data for the purposes you have consented to
  * Explaining how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy
  * Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure
  * Never selling your personal account data or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes. 
  * Retaining your data for the shortest possible time that is consistent with maintaining, understanding, and improving Grand Theft Wiki, and our obligations under law.
