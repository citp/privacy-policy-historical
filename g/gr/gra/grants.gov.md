Thank you for visiting Grants.gov and reviewing our privacy and security policy.

Grants.gov privacy policy protects the rights of individual users under section [552a of title 5, United States Code](http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode05/usc_sec_05_00000552---a000-.html) (commonly referred to as the 'Privacy Act', and other laws relevant to the protection of the privacy of an individual). All information is gathered, stored, and used in accordance with the above mentioned Privacy Act.

**Our privacy and security policy is clear:** _We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us._

Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically:**  
Grants.gov does not require a user to submit information to browse the Grants.gov site. The only users who are required to submit contact information are those users who wish to be authorized submitters on behalf of their organization, or users who wish to receive information directly from Grants.gov. 

Grants.gov collects personal information about you (e.g., name, email address, phone number, title, username) only if you specifically and knowingly give it to us. If you consent to provide us with personal information (by providing feedback or by asking a question), we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. We only share the information you give us with other government agencies if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Moreover, we do not create individual profiles with the information you provide or give it to any private organizations. We do not collect information for commercial marketing.

Grants.gov collects information to allow access for three types of users: 

  * Agency Users
  * Authorized Organization Representatives
  * Grants.gov Newsletter and Communication Notices Subscribers



All information collected and stored is in compliance with the [Paperwork Reduction Act](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/prareprt.html "Paper Reduction Act"). Any information submitted to Grants.gov through the application process will be stored in the Grants.gov system for a period of six months. Additionally, no one from Grants.gov will ever ask you for personal information, such as a Social Security number, banking, or credit card information. 

When you browse, read pages or download information on Grants.gov, we automatically gather and store certain technical information about your visit. This information never identifies who you are. The information we collect and store about your visit is listed below: 

  * The Internet domain (e.g., "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our web site; 
  * The type of browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) and operating system (e.g.,Windows, Unix) used to access our site; 
  * The date and time you access our site; 
  * The pages you visit; and 
  * If you linked to the Grants.gov website from another web site, the address of the website. 



This information is only used to help us make the site more useful for you. With this data we learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We never track or record information about individuals and their visits.
