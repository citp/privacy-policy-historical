            <h1>Grammarly Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p class="terms-update">Last updated on&nbsp;April 11, 2014</p>

            <div class="terms">
                <p>Grammarly values the privacy of&nbsp;your personal information and User Content. This Privacy Policy
                    (this “Policy”) explains what information Grammarly, Inc., a&nbsp;Delaware corporation,
                    and its subsidiaries and other affiliates (together, “Grammarly” or&nbsp;“we”
                    and sometimes&nbsp;“us”) collect about you and why, what we&nbsp;may do&nbsp;with that
                    information and how we&nbsp;handle your personal information and User Content.</p>

                <h3>What Is&nbsp;The Scope Of&nbsp;This Privacy Policy?</h3>

                <p>This Policy is&nbsp;incorporated into Grammarly’s Terms of&nbsp;Service and License Agreement
                    located at&nbsp;<a href="https://nspl.grammarly.com/terms">https://nspl.grammarly.com/terms</a>
                    (the “Terms of&nbsp;Service”), and applies
                    to&nbsp;the information obtained by&nbsp;us through your use of&nbsp;the Site, the Services, the
                    Software
                    (together, “Products”) and other Grammarly products and services. Capitalized terms used
                    in&nbsp;this Policy and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings provided for those terms
                    in&nbsp;the Terms of&nbsp;Service.</p>

                <h3>Will This Privacy Policy Ever Change?</h3>

                <p>As&nbsp;Grammarly evolves, we&nbsp;may need to&nbsp;update this Policy to&nbsp;keep pace with changes
                    in&nbsp;our Products, our business and laws applicable to&nbsp;us and you; we&nbsp;will, however,
                    always maintain our commitment to&nbsp;respect your privacy. We&nbsp;will email you (to&nbsp;your
                    most recently provided email address) or&nbsp;post any revisions to&nbsp;this Policy, along with
                    their
                    effective date, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;find area of&nbsp;the Site, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;recommend
                    that you periodically check back here to&nbsp;stay informed of&nbsp;any changes. We&nbsp;will ask
                    for your consent to&nbsp;such changes if&nbsp;required by&nbsp;applicable law; in&nbsp;other cases,
                    please note that your continuation of&nbsp;your Grammarly account after any change means that you
                    agree with, and consent to&nbsp;be&nbsp;bound&nbsp;by, the new Policy. If&nbsp;you disagree with any
                    changes in&nbsp;this Policy and do&nbsp;not wish your information to&nbsp;be&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;the
                    revised Policy, you will need to&nbsp;close your Grammarly account.</p>

                <h2>I. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h2>

                <h3>What Information Does Grammarly Collect About Me&nbsp;and Why?</h3>

                <p>We&nbsp;collect very little personal information about our users. A&nbsp;list of&nbsp;the “Personal
                    Information” Grammarly may collect, and why we&nbsp;collect&nbsp;it, follows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your username, email address and contact preferences. This lets&nbsp;us create your account,
                        provide you with convenient and personalized access to&nbsp;your account and deliver and support
                        our Products. This information also helps&nbsp;us communicate with you about your use of&nbsp;our
                        Products, product announcements and software updates, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;respond to&nbsp;your
                        requests for assistance (including providing account verification support if&nbsp;you’re
                        having difficultly accessing your account). In&nbsp;addition, we&nbsp;may use your Personal
                        Information
                        to&nbsp;send you direct marketing emails and special offers. For more information, please see
                        the section below entitled, “Will Grammarly Send Me&nbsp;Emails?”</li>

                    <li>For paying users, your payment information required to&nbsp;complete a&nbsp;commercial
                        transaction
                        on&nbsp;the Site. We&nbsp;use this information to&nbsp;enable and fulfill your transaction.
                    </li>

                    <li>The geographic area where you use your computer and mobile devices (as&nbsp;indicated by&nbsp;an&nbsp;IP
                        address or&nbsp;similar identifier), and the language you select when interacting with our
                        Products.
                        We&nbsp;collect this information in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;help&nbsp;us deliver and support our
                        Products,
                        including by&nbsp;localizing your experience. This information also helps&nbsp;us improve our
                        understanding of&nbsp;how our users use the Products.
                    </li>

                    <li>The Grammarly products and services you use. This information helps&nbsp;us deliver and support
                        our Products and respond to&nbsp;your requests for assistance. We&nbsp;also collect this
                        information
                        to&nbsp;improve our understanding of&nbsp;how our users use our Products.
                    </li>

                    <li>Any User Content you add to&nbsp;your account. We&nbsp;don’t use this information for any
                        purpose other than to&nbsp;provide the Services, make sure it&nbsp;is&nbsp;available to&nbsp;you
                        when you use our Products and improve our algorithms underlying our Products.
                    </li>

                    <li>&nbsp;unique device identifier for devices that are using Grammarly software. We&nbsp;use this
                        information&nbsp;to (i) calculate aggregate statistics on&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;unique devices
                        using our Products, and (ii) detect and prevent misuse of&nbsp;our Products. Our third party
                        fraud detection partner also uses device identifiers for the detection and prevention of&nbsp;fraud
                        and malicious use of&nbsp;our Products.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Site and the Software also collect and receive information from your computer or&nbsp;mobile
                    device,
                    including the activities you perform within your account, the type of&nbsp;hardware and software you
                    are using (for example, your operating system, word processing or&nbsp;other productivity software
                    and browser type) and information obtained from cookies. When you access the Software, that
                    application
                    will request access to&nbsp;certain information on&nbsp;your computing device.</p>

                <p>The Site also contains electronic images known as&nbsp;“web beacons” (or&nbsp;“single-pixel
                    gifs”)
                    and are used along with cookies to&nbsp;compile aggregated statistics to&nbsp;analyze how the Site
                    is&nbsp;used and may be&nbsp;used in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;our emails to&nbsp;let&nbsp;us know which
                    emails
                    and links have been opened by&nbsp;recipients. Web beacons allow&nbsp;us to&nbsp;gauge the
                    effectiveness
                    of&nbsp;our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>

                <p>We&nbsp;use a&nbsp;third party to&nbsp;gather information about how you and others use the Site. For
                    example,
                    we&nbsp;will know how many users access a&nbsp;specific page and which links they clicked&nbsp;on.
                    We&nbsp;use this aggregated information to&nbsp;better understand and optimize the Site.</p>

                <p>Gathering this kind of&nbsp;information helps&nbsp;us administer our Products, provide convenient and
                    personalized user access and improve the features and usability of&nbsp;our Products.</p>

                <p>In&nbsp;addition, we&nbsp;automatically gather non-personally identifiable information that indicates
                    your association with one of&nbsp;our business partners or&nbsp;certain promotions. We&nbsp;use this
                    information to&nbsp;determine the amount of&nbsp;revenue share payments to&nbsp;make to&nbsp;partners
                    with whom we&nbsp;might have such arrangements and to&nbsp;provide anonymized aggregate reports.</p>

                <p>Finally, if&nbsp;you choose to&nbsp;use PayPal<sup class="reg">®</sup> to&nbsp;finalize and pay
                    for your order, you will provide your credit card number, directly to&nbsp;PayPal<sup class="reg">®</sup>.
                    The privacy policy of&nbsp;PayPal<sup class="reg">®</sup> will apply to&nbsp;the information you
                    provide on&nbsp;the PayPal<sup class="reg">®</sup> website.</p>

                <h3>What Else Should I&nbsp;Know About The Tracking Information Grammarly Collects?</h3>

                <p>Grammarly uses cookies and tracking pixels to&nbsp;collect information that helps&nbsp;us provide our
                    Products to&nbsp;you. We&nbsp;also use these technologies to&nbsp;help deliver ads for relevant
                    Grammarly products and services to&nbsp;you when you visit certain pages on&nbsp;the Site and then
                    visit certain third-party sites. We&nbsp;may also use cookies, for example, to&nbsp;keep track of&nbsp;your
                    preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to&nbsp;collect general usage and volume
                    statistical information that does not include personal information.</p>

                <p>While, as&nbsp;described above, you may have the opportunity to&nbsp;control the use of&nbsp;cookies
                    through your web browser, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;not currently respond to&nbsp;web browser “Do&nbsp;Not
                    Track” signals or&nbsp;other similar mechanisms. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;in&nbsp;the
                    future,
                    we&nbsp;will describe how we&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;in&nbsp;this Policy.</p>

                <h3>Will Grammarly Send Me&nbsp;Emails?</h3>

                <p>From time to&nbsp;time, we&nbsp;may want to&nbsp;contact you with information about product
                    announcements,
                    software updates and special offers. We&nbsp;also may want to&nbsp;contact you with information
                    about
                    products and services from our business partners. We&nbsp;consider your acceptance of&nbsp;this
                    Policy
                    as&nbsp;your acceptance of&nbsp;our offer to&nbsp;send you these emails. You may opt out of&nbsp;such
                    communications at&nbsp;any time by&nbsp;clicking the “unsubscribe” link found within
                    Grammarly
                    email updates and changing your contact preferences. You will continue to&nbsp;receive essential
                    account-related information, even if&nbsp;you unsubscribe from promotional emails.</p>

                <h3>Does Grammarly Provide any Information to&nbsp;Third Party Analytics Providers?</h3>

                <p>Grammarly makes use of&nbsp;certain third party analytics providers (“TPAPs”) to, among

                    (“Visitors”) on&nbsp;third party websites across such TPAPs’ networks. Grammarly
                    allows TPAPs to&nbsp;track Visitors’ browsing history on&nbsp;the Site using first-party
                    cookies
                    (such as&nbsp;the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as&nbsp;the DoubleClick
                    cookie).
                    TPAPs may use the information stored by&nbsp;the cookies&nbsp;to, among other things, evaluate your
                    use of&nbsp;a&nbsp;website, prepare reports of&nbsp;website activities for website operators and
                    provide
                    other services associated with website and internet usage. The information tracked and stored by&nbsp;the
                    cookies enables TPAPs to&nbsp;optimize and serve ads to&nbsp;the Site’s visitors on&nbsp;third
                    party websites. By&nbsp;using the Site, you agree to&nbsp;the forwarding of&nbsp;data to&nbsp;TPAPs
                    and the processing by&nbsp;such TPAPs of&nbsp;the data collected from you in&nbsp;the manner and for
                    the purposes described above.</p>

                <h3>Does Grammarly Ever Make Any of&nbsp;My&nbsp;Personal Information or&nbsp;User Content Public?</h3>

                <p>No, except as&nbsp;otherwise described in&nbsp;this Policy.</p>

                <h2>III. DATA STORAGE AND TRANSFER</h2>

                <h3>Where Is&nbsp;My&nbsp;Data Stored?</h3>

                <p>When you use our Products, User Content you transmit will be&nbsp;stored on&nbsp;our servers, which
                    are
                    located in&nbsp;the United States. When you use the Software on&nbsp;your computing device, User
                    Content
                    you save will be&nbsp;stored locally on&nbsp;that device and sync with our servers.</p>

                <p>Please be&nbsp;aware that Personal Information and User Content submitted to&nbsp;Grammarly will
                    be&nbsp;transferred to&nbsp;a&nbsp;data center in&nbsp;the United States. If&nbsp;you post or&nbsp;transfer
                    any information to&nbsp;or&nbsp;through our Products, you are confirming your consent to&nbsp;such
                    information, including Personal Information and User Content, being hosted and accessed in&nbsp;the
                    United States.</p>

                <p>Data privacy laws or&nbsp;regulations in&nbsp;your home country may differ from those in&nbsp;the
                    United States,
                    but Grammarly complies with applicable law regarding the collection, use and retention of&nbsp;Personal
                    Information collected from all our users.</p>

                <h3>How Secure Is&nbsp;My&nbsp;Data?</h3>

                <p>Grammarly is&nbsp;committed to&nbsp;protecting the security of&nbsp;your information and takes
                    reasonable
                    precautions to&nbsp;protect&nbsp;it. However, Internet data transmissions, whether wired or&nbsp;wireless,
                    cannot be&nbsp;guaranteed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;100% secure, and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, we&nbsp;cannot
                    ensure
                    the security of&nbsp;information you transmit to&nbsp;us, including Personal Information and User
                    Content;
                    accordingly, you acknowledge that you do&nbsp;so&nbsp;at&nbsp;your own risk.</p>

                <p>We&nbsp;use industry standard encryption to&nbsp;protect your data in&nbsp;transit. This is&nbsp;commonly
                    referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;transport layer security (“TLS”) or&nbsp;secure socket layer
                    (“SSL”) technology.</p>

                <p>Once we&nbsp;receive your data, we&nbsp;protect it&nbsp;on&nbsp;our servers using a&nbsp;combination
                    of&nbsp;administrative, physical and logical security safeguards. The security of&nbsp;the
                    information
                    stored locally in&nbsp;any of&nbsp;our Products installed on&nbsp;your computing device requires
                    that
                    you make use of&nbsp;the security features of&nbsp;your device. We&nbsp;recommend that you take the
                    appropriate steps to&nbsp;secure all computing devices that you use with our applications and
                    service.</p>

                <p>If&nbsp;Grammarly learns of&nbsp;a&nbsp;security system breach, we&nbsp;may attempt to&nbsp;notify
                    you
                    and provide information on&nbsp;protective steps, if&nbsp;available, through the email address that
                    you
                    have provided to&nbsp;us or&nbsp;by&nbsp;posting a&nbsp;notice on&nbsp;the Site. Depending on&nbsp;where
                    you live, you may have a&nbsp;legal right to&nbsp;receive such notices in&nbsp;writing.</p>

                <h2>IV. INFORMATION DELETION</h2>

                <h3>What Happens If&nbsp;I&nbsp;Want to&nbsp;Stop Using Grammarly?</h3>

                <p>You can stop using our Products at&nbsp;any time. Residual copies of&nbsp;your Personal Information

                    systems for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;one year due to&nbsp;the nature of&nbsp;those systems’
                    operations.</p>

                <h3>What Happens If&nbsp;Grammarly Closes My&nbsp;Account?</h3>

                <p>If&nbsp;Grammarly closes your account due to&nbsp;your violation of&nbsp;the Terms of&nbsp;Service,
                    then you may contact Grammarly to&nbsp;request deletion of&nbsp;your data, and Grammarly will
                    evaluate
                    such requests on&nbsp;a&nbsp;case by&nbsp;case basis, pursuant to&nbsp;our legal obligations.</p>
