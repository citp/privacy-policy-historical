You will be asked to provide certain personal information (such as a user name and email address) when you register an account at the Grazr.com site. This account allows you to upload and edit files on the site. We will not share this personal information with any third parties. We will not send commercial or marketing messages to any address registered with us, but we may use this address to notify you of customer service issues related to the Grazr.com site, and to deliver a replacement password in the event you request one.

**Use of Cookies**

When you visit the Grazr.com site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.

The Grazr Web servers record general information about user activity to log files. We use these logs to ensure smooth operation of our servers, and for general website and application maintenance. Our logs may include timestamps, your browser IP address (as it appears to the server), and the feeds you open. Our detailed server logs will not be shared with any third party. We may, however, publish aggregate statistics on visitor activity from time to time based on log information, such as the number of feeds served over a specific period of time. We will never publish any personally identifiable information in these analyses.
