# Privacy Policy - GradAustralia

### **1\. We respect privacy**

1.1 GradAustralia Pty Ltd ABN 43 168 218 782 ("GradAustralia", "we" or "us") respects the right to privacy and is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our customers and our website visitors.  We adhere to the Australian Privacy Principles and other obligations contained in the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth). The Australian Privacy Principles may be accessed at:<http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-resources/privacy-fact-sheets/other/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles>. This policy sets out how we collect and treat personal information.

1.2 "Personal information" is information we hold which is identifiable as being about an individual.

1.3 This policy covers our treatment of information, including personal information that we may gather when you access or use a GradAustralia Service (as defined in our General Terms and Conditions) and also applies to your use of our website, products, services and mobile applications (collectively, the “Services”), but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We may gather various types of information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this information for you to interact with our Services, internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our Services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfil your requests for certain products and services, and to analyse how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some personal information with third parties.

### **2\. Collection of personal information**

2.1. We will, from time to time, collect, receive and store personal information provided via the website or in the course of our services, (such as via the completion of a Workplace Survey as defined under our Advertiser Terms & Conditions) from you, provided to us directly or given to us in other forms. 

2.2. You may provide basic information such as your name, phone number, address and email address to us directly, to enable us to send information, provide updates and process a product or service. We may collect additional information at other times, including but not limited to, when you provide feedback, or when you provide information about your personal or business affairs, change content or email preferences, respond to surveys and/or promotions or provide financial or credit card information.

2.3 You may have the option of registering an account and logging into or otherwise linking to that account using a third-party account such as Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application. If you choose to provide or log into your account using your credentials for a third-party platform we may have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, contacts or friend’s lists, account information, public profile, and email address. Consequently, if you provide your third-party account credentials, you acknowledge that the above-identified information, as well as other information for that account (collectively, “Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your GradAustralia account if you authorize such transmissions. You further acknowledge that Third Party Account Information transmitted to us is governed by this Privacy Policy.

3.2  You generally have the right not to identify yourself when dealing with us where it is lawful and practicable for us to allow it. However, on many occasions we will not be able to do this, and provide our Services to you.

### **4.   How do we collect personal information?**

4.1 We may collect personal information in a variety of ways, including when you interact with us electronically, when you access our website or software applications and when we provide our services. We may receive personal information from third parties.

4.2 Additionally, there may be instances where you find it necessary to communicate directly with us or where you have provided us with the means to communicate with you. For example, if you have given us your email address, we may send promotional email offers to you, notify you of any changes to contractual terms or Services, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive data when you open an email from us or use our Services, including your contacts information. This data helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our Services. You are, however, free to opt out of receiving email communications from us by navigating to the settings page within the Services. Please note, however, that you may be unable to opt out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Services, such as a confirmation or service notifications.
