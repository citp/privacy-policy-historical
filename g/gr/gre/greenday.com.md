# Privacy Policy :: Greenday.com

We at Green Day, Inc. think your privacy is important and have created this privacy policy to describe how we collect, use, and disclose information we obtain through www.greenday.com (the "Site"). This privacy policy does not govern our use of any information you provide to us when you call us, write to us, or communicate with us in any manner other than through the Site. Because the Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. By using the Site, you explicitly consent to such use of your information and agree to the terms of this privacy policy. This privacy policy is effective as of August 1, 2004.

#### Information You Choose to Submit

You can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information (which we will refer to in this privacy policy as "Personal Information") about yourself. However, to obtain access to certain areas of the Site (e.g., the Idiot Club area), you are required to provide certain Personal Information (e.g., your name, age, gender, address, e-mail address and credit card number) and we ask that you also provide a user name and password to access such areas. To join our mailing list, you are required to provide your e-mail address. We use such information to provide the service your requested, to bill you for your purchases, to monitor internally usage of the Site, and to contact you from time to time about us, the Site, and our products and services.

#### Information We Automatically Collect

We automatically collect certain information to help us understand how visitors use the Site (which we will refer to in this privacy policy as "Usage Data"). For example, each time you visit the Site we automatically collect your IP address, browser and computer type, access time, the webpage from which you came, and the webpage(s) that you access during your visit. We also use cookies (which are small amounts of data sent from a web server to your browser that are stored on your computer's hard drive) to keep track of your use of the Site, to validate your identity, to remember your password and preferences, to tailor the Site to meet your personal interests, and to improve the quality of the Site. In addition, third parties who place advertisements on the Site may also collect information through cookies to ensure that their advertising systems and technologies work properly and to allow them to track responses to their advertisements. Cookies set by these third parties are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. Generally, you can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you if you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to choose whether or not to accept the cookie. Please note that if you do set your browser not to accept cookies, certain areas of our Site may not function properly.

#### Our Information Sharing Practices

Generally. Except as otherwise described in this section of our privacy policy, we will not share your Personal Information or Usage Data with any third party without your permission.

Aggregated Data. From time to time, we may share aggregated Personal Information (excluding any credit card information) and Usage Data with third parties. We will not share any aggregated data, however, in manner that would enable the recipient to personally identify you. In addition, we may combine Usage Data with Personal Information in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user. We do so, however, only for our own internal business purposes and will not share such combined data with third parties without your permission.

Service Providers. From time to time, we may enter into relationships with third parties who provide services to us (e.g., credit card processing services or data management and storage services). In those circumstances, we disclose information about you that is necessary for such service providers to perform those services and require that they maintain the confidentiality of such information.

Third-Party Marketers. From time to time we may share your Personal Information (excluding any credit card information) with third parties that provide goods or services that relate to the band (e.g., the band's record label or merchandising company) so they may contact you regarding those goods and services. If you would like us not to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, please contact us as noted below in "Choice/Opt-Out."

Contests. We are required by law to disclose the full name and state of residence of the winner(s) of any contest that we offer through the Site. If you enter and win any such contest, for a period of two years after you have won your full name and state of residence will be disclosed to anyone who requests such information.

Other Disclosure Scenarios. Notwithstanding anything in this privacy policy to the contrary, we reserve the right, unless limited by applicable law, to share any information we have collected about you or that you have submitted: (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; (2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property; (3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding significant abuse of the Site's infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information); (4) to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this privacy policy); and (5) if we are acquired by or merged with another entity.

#### Public Areas

Your use of areas of our website that are intended for interaction with other users (e.g., message boards, discussion rooms, and other online forums) may allow you to post Personal Information. By choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone may access, use, and disclose any Personal Information that you post to those areas.

#### Choice/Opt-Out

We offer you the opportunity to (1) choose not to receive communications from us, and (2) request that we not share your information with third parties. If you would like to take advantage of this opportunity, please let us know by accessing and updating your profile on the Site or by sending us an e mail to idiotclub@greenday.com. Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to process and that we are not responsible for removing information about you from the database of any third party to whom we were authorized to disclose your Personal Information prior to processing your request. Even if you do take advantage of these opportunities, we reserve the right to send you administrative messages relating to the Site (e.g., about changes to this privacy policy), to contact you regarding services you have ordered, and to share your information with our service providers.

#### Modifying and Deleting Your Personal Information

If you would like to modify or delete from our database any Personal Information you previously submitted to us, please let us know by accessing and updating your profile on the Site or by sending us an e mail to idiotclub@greenday.com. Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to process, that any Personal Information that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your request, and that if you delete certain information (e.g., your billing address or credit card number) you may not be able to order services in the future without re-submitting such information. Also, please note that we will maintain information about you in our database whenever we are required to do so by law.

#### Security

We have implemented reasonable measures to help protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its security.

#### Links

The Site contains links to other websites, including some through which you may purchase products or services (e.g., band-related merchandise or concert tickets). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such other website and urge you to review such practices prior to submitting any information to such websites.

#### Changes

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If under any such update we make any material change to the way in which we treat your Personal Information or Usage Data, we will inform you of such change via e mail or by posting a notice on relevant areas of the Site. Any updated version of this privacy policy will be effective as of the date set forth therein.

#### Note to Parents

Before we can collect, use, or disclose any Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we are required to obtain the consent of that child's parent or guardian. We are prohibited by law from conditioning a child's participation in a game, the offering of a prize, or another similar activity on the child's disclosure of more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. We use and disclose a child's Personal Information as described above in this privacy policy. Please note that the third parties identified above to whom we disclose Personal Information for their own marketing purposes are not obligated to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of such Personal Information. However, you may choose to allow us to collect and use your child's Personal Information while prohibiting us from disclosing that information to such third parties. If you wish to do so, please contact us or follow the instructions noted above in "Choice/Opt-Out." In addition, you have the right at any time to review, delete, and/or prohibit any future collection or use by us of your child's Personal Information. If you wish to do so, please contact us or follow the instructions noted above in "Modifying and Deleting Your Personal Information."
