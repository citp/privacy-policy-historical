For example, if you post a comment on our Facebook page or send us a message on Twitter, we may collect and use that information as described in this Privacy Policy.  

### What About Cookies and Other Similar Technologies?

We and third party processors acting on our behalf use various internet technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, etc.,  to help us manage the Site and track your behavior across the Site so we can tailor information and advertisements to make your experience more enjoyable.  We use these tracking tools to serve you with interest-based advertising and to better understand your behaviors and browsing activities.  You can opt-out of online behavioral advertising by going to [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).  Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.  These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.  

If you wish, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, keep in mind that cookies may be required to place an online order and for other Site functions, so blocking cookies may negatively impact your Site experience and not all of the tracking will stop. **Should you wish to block cookies through your web browser, you may still purchase products through our Customer Care Center, at 888-879-4627.**
