# Privacy policy | Greenpeace UK

Greenpeace believes you have a fundamental right to privacy on the web and we work to protect your security online as vigorously as possible. We have developed the following policy to help you understand how your personal information will be treated as you engage with us both online and off. Our policy reflects our duties under the [Data Protection Act](http://www.ico.org.uk/) to use information fairly, keep it secure, make sure it is accurate, and keep it up to date.

This policy applies to:

  * Greenpeace Ltd, company number 1314381, Canonbury Villas, London N1 2PN.
  * Greenpeace Environmental Trust, registered charity in England and Wales 284934, company number 1636817, Canonbury Villas, London, N1 2PN.



Greenpeace Ltd and Greenpeace Environmental Trust are registered as data controllers with the Information Commissioner for the United Kingdom and are collectively referred to as Greenpeace in this document.

This policy applies to all the pages hosted on this site. It does not apply to pages hosted by other Greenpeace sites around the world, or to other organisations to which we may link and whose privacy policies may differ.

By signing up to our campaigns or supporting us as a donor, you accept this privacy policy and authorise Greenpeace to collect, store and process your information in the ways explained.

Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated. It may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

This policy explains:

  1. What information we collect
  2. How your information is used
  3. The limited circumstances in which Greenpeace UK may share your information
  4. How secure your information is
  5. How you can access, correct or delete your data
  6. How you can opt out of receiving messages from Greenpeace UK
  7. How Greenpeace UK protects children's privacy  

  8. How you can find out more about your rights under the Data Protection Act



**1\. What information we collect**

We collect the information you give to us by email, via the various forms on the website, over the telephone, face-to-face or by postal mail. Some information is gathered when you join, make a donation, complete an online action or sign up to receive email updates. During these processes, the only information asked for is your name, address, phone and email (plus payment method if you are joining or donating), although we may request other information such as your principal area(s) of interest in order to be able to keep you up to date with the things you’re most interested in. We may use your name and address information to contact you by telephone.

When we collect this information on our website, we say:

_“If you leave your details, we'll keep you updated about our campaigns and other ways you can help. We'll never sell or swap your details and you can unsubscribe at any time - just check our[privacy policy](http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/about/privacy-policy)”_.

We use similar wording when collecting your information over the telephone, by email, through the post or face-to-face.

**2\. How your information is used**

Greenpeace uses your details for:

  * Administering your donations and membership
  * Contacting you with information and updates about our campaigns and events in your area
  * Fundraising
  * Administering volunteer records
  * Supporter surveys
  * Research and analysis



We may share your details with trusted service providers in order to fulfil the above services. Where this service is done on behalf of Greenpeace, this is done under contract and relevant security measures are taken.

Greenpeace uses the information you give us to contact you with communications that may be of interest to you, by post, phone or email.

We send email updates about our campaigns and you may get communications from your nearest local group about events happening in your area. If you have made a donation, we will also send you information about our campaigns in the post.

We also use cookies and tracking to help us understand more about how supporters use our site and make improvements:

**Cookies and tracking**

**How cookies work:**

Cookies are small files that are downloaded onto your computer (or your mobile phone) from websites that you visit. Cookies contain information that allows websites to recognise that you have used the site before.

**How we use cookies**

We use cookies, like most websites, to help us provide you with the best experience when you visit our site. Some cookies are crucial to the smooth running of our website - for example our donation pages rely on them. Other cookies allow us to understand (by using tools like Google Analytics) how visitors are interacting with our website, so that we can improve it. Cookies also make it easy for you to share the content on our site with your contacts on Facebook or other social networks.

We also use cookies to ensure that any investments we make in online advertising are as cost-effective as possible, by tracking how well individual adverts perform. These cookies are issued by third party service providers that we have assessed as secure. From time to time, we will display adverts on other websites to people who have visited our website before, and the technology behind these adverts is also based on cookies. These cookies, as with all others we use, do not contain information that can personally identify you.

**Managing cookies**

All browsers allow you to control which cookies you accept and which you delete. You will usually find these settings under the 'Preferences' or 'Tools' menu of your browser. For more information about cookies, please see [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**3\. The limited circumstances in which Greenpeace UK may share your information**

We will not sell your information to anyone else and will only share your information with trusted third party service providers in order to fulfil some of our communications with you. Where other companies are used to capture data or undertake fulfilment services on our behalf, these activities are carried out under contract in compliance with the Data Protection Act requirements.

Occasionally we will tell you about products or services offered by other organisations (such as, for example, the Greenpeace credit card, provided by The Co-operative Bank) and in these cases, we will make it clear if the information you provide is given to the organisation concerned and, if so, for what purposes. 

Greenpeace guarantees not to disclose any of your personally identifiable information unless we have your permission, or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

**4\. How secure your information is**

Greenpeace uses industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. We make every effort to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. In addition, we always use a secure connection when collecting personal financial information from you. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.

We also do everything in our power to protect your information offline, and only authorised personnel can view your data.

All forms which request credit card or bank details use the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol for encryption. Most web browsers (e.g. Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, etc.) support SSL. The link between your web browser and the server is secure if your web browser displays a small padlock or key symbol somewhere in the frame, or the address bar shows a web address beginning https:// (rather than http://).

**5\. How you can access, correct or delete your data**

You can contact us at any time by email, letter or telephone to change or update your details.

At your request we will give you all details of personal information held about you by Greenpeace, once identity has been satisfactorily verified. Incorrect information will be deleted or amended promptly. We will give you confirmation of corrections and deletions. We can only accept these requests if sent by email or letter, after which we will take further steps to confirm your identity before releasing data. We will respond to these requests within 20 working days, unless there are exceptional circumstances, and even then we will let you know what is happening with your request. Please note that we reserve the right to charge a fee of £10 for any such request to offset costs incurred. 

**6.How you can opt out of receiving messages from Greenpeace UK**

You can unsubscribe from receiving emails from us at any time, using the unsubscribe function on the email. 

If you do not wish to receive postal communications or phone calls from us, please contact us asking us not to contact you in this way in future. 

**7\. How Greenpeace UK protects children's privacy**

The safety of children is very important to us. No information should be submitted or posted to Greenpeace by children under the age of 13 without prior parental/guardian consent. All applicable laws are followed with respect to data collection from children. Where we have date of birth information, we will not share data collected from children with any third parties at any time under any circumstances.

NB: parents/guardians should be aware that owing to the nature of our investigations, images posted on the Greenpeace website may be considered unsuitable for children under the age of 13 (e.g. photographs of dead or dying animals).

If you are aged under 13, please ensure you obtain your parent/guardian's consent before sending any personal information to this website.
