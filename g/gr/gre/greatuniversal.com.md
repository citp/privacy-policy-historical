What information do you collect about me and why?  
Littlewoods Shop Direct Home Shopping Limited ("Littlewoods Shop Direct") provides your goods. The Littlewoods Shop Direct group of companies ("the Group") also includes Shop Direct Financial Services Limited, which provides your main catalogue credit account, subject to status, and arranges other financial services products, and Littlewoods Finance Company Limited, which may also offer you other credit facilities and/or financial products, subject to status. Both companies are subsidiaries of Everyday Financial Solutions Limited together known as "EFS".

A full list of Littlewoods Shop Direct Group companies is available from the Data Protection Unit, Littlewoods Shop Direct Home Shopping Limited, Park Lane, Netherton, Liverpool, L72 1LE.

Credit Applications

  


  * If you apply for credit EFS will search your record at a credit reference agency or agencies who will supply EFS with credit information as well as information from the electoral register. EFS will use credit scoring methods to assess your application and to verify your identity. Credit searches and other information which is provided to EFS and/or the credit reference agencies about you and those with whom you are financially linked may be used by EFS and other companies if credit decisions are made about you or other members of your household. You are linked with another individual by means of a joint credit application or running a joint credit account. Even if your application goes no further, the credit reference agencies will add details of this search and your application to your record.
  * In assessing you for credit and to manage your account EFS may also use any information which the Group already holds about you.
  * EFS may occasionally search your records with the credit reference agencies so they can manage your account and take further decisions about credit. These searches will not be available to other lenders for credit assessment purposes
  * If EFS enters into a credit agreement with you they will also add details of your agreement as well as ongoing details of your account and how you manage it to credit reference agency records. If you do not repay on time or in full they will tell the credit reference agencies who will record details of the debt. All this information will be seen by other organisations carrying out later searches and EFS may also share it directly within the Group. The information may be used to assess you for credit or to verify your identity.



Fraud Prevention

  
For everyone's protection, we check the details of every first order with the fraud prevention agencies and these checks may be repeated with future orders. The Group may also use the information you have given, or which the Group already holds about you.

If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies.

Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.

We and other organisations may access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when: 

  * Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities;
  * Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities;
  * Recovering debt;
  * Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance; 
  * Checking details of job applicants and employees

We and other organisations may also access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.  
|  Please telephone freephone 0800 092 9054 if you want to have details of those credit reference and fraud prevention agencies from whom EFS obtains and to whom EFS gives information about you. You have a legal right to these details. EFS, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies and other home shopping traders may also use the records for statistical analysis about credit, insurance and fraud.

Littlewoods Shop Direct and EFS may use automated decision making systems when assessing you for credit and for fraud prevention.

Payment by Cheque  
If you pay by cheque we may use the Transax service, provided by Certegy Limited, to help us in deciding whether to accept your cheque. If your cheque is dishonoured, we will inform Certegy and also provide them with any information we hold (including your name and address). We may assign our rights to collect a debt to Certegy Limited. Certegy will hold information about you in order to enable them to collect a debt and may carry out a credit check where they deem it necessary to facilitate collection. Certegy will record information in relation to any cheque it is asked to guarantee and will use it to decide whether to guarantee future cheques where a subscribing organisation requests such information to assist it in deciding whether to accept a cheque as a payment. Certegy will charge an administration fee for the collection of a dishonoured cheque.

In the event that you have any questions about the personal information held by Certegy that relates to you, or for details of the Credit Reference Agency they use, please phone 0870 240 4222.

Insurance Policies, Extended Guarantees and Shopping Insurance  
Your insurance policy or service plan will be set up by EFS. Your information may be used as detailed above and may also be passed to insurers (for insurance applications only), service plan providers (in both cases for administration purposes) and relevant regulators.

Can I access the information you hold about me?  
Yes, you can obtain details of the personal information we hold on you by contacting us at Data Protection Unit, Great Universal, Park Lane, Netherton, Liverpool, L72 1LE. Alternatively, please email us at [queries@greatuniversal.com](mailto:queries@greatuniversal.com). There is a statutory fee for access to your information, currently £10.
