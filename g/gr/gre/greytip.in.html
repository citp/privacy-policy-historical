<h2>How we use and collect your information</h2>
<p>In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Information you provide</strong> - When you sign up for a Greytip Account or other Greytip service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). For our SaaS customers, we also maintain Customer Data which is managed differently as explained in a later section.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookies</strong> - When you visit Greytip, we send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies primarily for user authentication but may also use them to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Log information</strong> - When you access Greytip services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</li>
    <li><strong>User communications</strong> - When you send email or other communications to Greytip, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Greytip processes the various information you provide to offer solutions and results to you. We may process the information for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services.</li>
    <li>Aggregating usage patterns, trends and other statistics.</li>
    <li>Developing new services.</li>
    <li>Greytip may also use data about customers for marketing purposes. For example, the Company may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in Greytip, the Service, and to send you information regarding the Company and its partners, such as information about promotions or events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that your Customer Data (see section below) is not used for any of the above purposes.</p>
<p>Greytip processes information on our servers in India and/or in the United States of America.</p>
<h2>Customer Data</h2>
<p>Greytip Customers use the Service to host data and information ("Customer Data"). Greytip will not review,  share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the  Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. Individual records of Customer Data may be viewed  or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issues, or suspected violation of the  Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. Customers are responsible for maintaining  the security and confidentiality of their Greytip user ids and passwords.</p>
<h2>Public Forums, Refer a Friend, and Customer Testimonials</h2>
<p>Greytip may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company's Web sites. Any personally identifiable information you choose to  submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages.  Greytip is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.  Customers and Visitors may elect to use the Company's referral service to inform friends about the Company's Web sites.  When using the referral service, the Company requests the friend's name and email address. Greytip will automatically send the friend  a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Company's Web sites. Greytip does not store this information.  Greytip posts a list of Customers and testimonials on the Company's Web sites that contain information such as Customer names and titles.  Greytip obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.</p>
<h2>Data integrity</h2>
<p>Greytip processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information  needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate,  complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="rightCol">
<h2>Information sharing</h2>
<p>Greytip only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Greytip in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
    <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Greytip, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Greytip becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>Please contact us at the address above for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.</p>
<h2>Accessing &amp; Updating Your Information</h2>
<p>Customers may update or change their registration information or company information by editing their user or organization record.  To update a user profile, please login to the relevant website and then update the details. To update Billing Information or have your registration information deleted,  please email <a href="mailto:privacy@greytip.com">privacy@greytip.com</a> or call +91-80-40225900. To discontinue your account and to have information you maintained in the Service returned to you,  please email <a href="mailto:privacy@greytip.com">privacy@greytip.com</a> or call +91080-40225900. Requests to access, change, or delete your information will be handled within 30 days.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Greytip uses robust security measures to protect Customer Data from unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the  appropriate use of Customer Data. When the Service is accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later,  or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology protects Customer Data using both server authentication and data encryption.  These technologies help ensure that Customer Data is safe, secure, and only available to the Customer to whom the information belongs and  those to whom the Customer has granted access. Greytip also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and  encoded session identifications, and the Company hosts its Web sites in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and  other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Greytip also offers enhanced security features  within the Service that permit Customers to configure security settings to the level they deem necessary.</p>
<p>Because the Company uses the Service to maintain Data About Greytip Customers, this information is secured in the same manner as  described above for Customer Data.</p>
<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>Greytip regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Greytip's treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at</p>
