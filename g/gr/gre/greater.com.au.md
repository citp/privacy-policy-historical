### PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT  
GREATER BUILDING SOCIETY LTD  
(ABN 88 087 651 956)

At The Greater we value our customers and their privacy.   We are very committed to keeping your personal information confidential.  As part of our commitment we comply with the ‘National Privacy Principles’ as set out in Schedule 3 of the _Privacy Act_ 1988 (Cth).

This Privacy Policy Statement will explain how we manage your personal information.

### Information Collection

We only collect information that we need to provide you with a product or facility that you have asked for.  This information includes your name, contact details (like telephone number and postal address), date of birth, tax file number (if you decide to provide it) and transactional information about the use of the product or service. 

In the case of a loan application, we will also need to collect and hold information about your financial position and information obtained from an insurer of your mortgage and credit checks, but only if you authorise us to do so.

The only personal information which we collect about you when you use our website (greater.com.au) is what you tell us about yourself, for example, by completing an online form such as a loan application or sending us an email.  When completing an online form, a small data file known as a “cookie” is written to your hard drive to help the website customise the pages you request.  The cookie is deleted once you close the browser or end the session.  When using our Internet Banking site, a cookie is used to help the system ensure your session security.  This cookie is removed when the session ends or you close the browser. 

We also use cookies to collect anonymous traffic data on our website.  This helps us to determine viewing trends, like the number of people who visit our site, the pages that they find the most interesting and the time and duration of their visit.

In addition, we may transmit web site usage information about our site visitors to third party ad servers for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on other sites.  To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our third party ad servers on our site.  The information that is collected and logged on our behalf through this technology is **not personally identifiable** to our third party ad servers and **we do not capture or transmit any web site usage information that can personally identify you**.

We may also use cookies to tell you about things that may be relevant to your interests.  You are able to opt out of the interest based cookies at any time.
