    GreatSchools Inc. If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you should contact our management
    team by emailing
    <a class="" href="mailto:info@greatschools.net">info@greatschools.net</a>

</p><h4>Information Collection and Use</h4><p>GreatSchools Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. GreatSchools
    Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this
    information to others in ways other than as disclosed in this statement.</p><h4>Cookies</h4><p>GreatSchools Inc. deposits cookies on users' hard drives. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard
    drive containing information about the user. By setting a cookie on our site, a user does not have to log in a
    password more than once and saves time while on our site. Users who reject the cookie may still use
    GreatSchools.net, but they may be limited in some areas of our site. </p><p>Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience. Some of
    the information about how our users experience our site, such as page views and specific pages visited, is
    logged by a third-party marketing company on our behalf, using cookies and Web beacons. Web beacons help us
    understand information such as what browsers our users have so that we are able to develop our site to best
    support our users. We control how this data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to
    improve our site, you can "opt out" by clicking here: <a target="_new" href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy#optout">http://www.omniture.com/privacy#optout</a>.
</p><p>
    GreatSchools is also working with QUANTCAST, a third party that provides new media measurement services that enable
    advertisers to view audience reports for web sites.  QUANTCAST utilizes certain technologies, including your IP
    address and information from cookies it places on your computer, that aggregate Internet activity to produce these
    reports and analyses.  This activity is observed on a purely anonymous basis, no Personal Data is provided to
    QUANTCAST by Greatschools and QUANTCAST does not collect or use any Personal Data relating to the individual doing
    the Internet browsing.  For more information about QUANTCAST'S privacy policy, please go
    to <a target="_new" href="http://www.quantcast.com/privacy.jsp">http://www.quantcast.com/privacy.jsp</a></p><h4>Log Files</h4><p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement and gather broad demographic
    information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p><h4>Sharing</h4><p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and sponsors. This is not linked to any
    personal information that can identify any individual person.</p><p>We use third-party vendors to provide services on the Web site, such as sending email messages to subscribers.
    The information that a user submits on the site will be provided to our vendor on a confidential basis for the
    sole purpose of delivering GreatSchools' communications to users who have 'opted in' to receive them. Your email
    address will not be shared with any other third party.</p><p>We may, however, release information provided by a user to the extent it is required to be disclosed pursuant to
    a valid order or requirement of a governmental agency or court.</p><p>The personal information you provide on the www.greatschools.net Web site will be sent directly to GreatSchools
    Inc., and will not be retained by any of our partners (such as BVIG, MSN, Yahoo, etc.). However, if you are on
    one of our co-branded partner pages (e.g., BVIG, MSN, Yahoo, etc.), the partner may track your page views of the
    links you click on the page.</p><h4>Links</h4><p>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that GreatSchools Inc. is not responsible for the
    privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage our users to be aware of when they leave our site and to
    read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This
    privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p><h4>Newsletters</h4><p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter or other email services, we may ask for contact information such
    as name and email address. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which
    they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as child's
    grade level or ZIP code) but encouraged so that we can provide more personalized service. This information is
    not shared with or sold to anyone for any purpose, except in accordance with this privacy policy.</p><p>From time to time, GreatSchools may email our newsletter subscribers a request to complete user surveys and/or
    events that we believe are of interest. This may include promotions from a related third-party sponsor.
    GreatSchools will never share your information directly with a third party, except in accordance with this
    privacy policy.</p><h4>Choice/Opt Out</h4><p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletters or other communications can unsubscribe using the tools
    provided in every email message we send or from the
    <a href="/cgi-bin/newsletters/state=TX">subscription management page</a>
    on the site.
</p><h4>User Surveys</h4><p>From time to time, we request information from users and newsletter subscribers via surveys. Participation in
    these surveys is voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
    Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic
    information (such as ZIP code, grade level). Contact information may be used to notify winners and award prizes.
    Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this
    site.</p><h4>Tell a Friend</h4><p>If users elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's
    name and email address. GreatSchools Inc. will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to
    visit the site. GreatSchools Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.
    The friend may contact GreatSchools Inc. at
    <a class="" href="mailto:info@greatschools.net">info@greatschools.net</a>
    to request the removal of this information from our database.
</p><h4>Security</h4><p>GreatSchools Inc. has implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure
    your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. When
    users submit
    sensitive information via the Web site, GreatSchools Inc. uses commercially reasonable efforts to protect their
    information both online and offline. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able
    to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. Thus, you acknowledge that you
    provide your personal information at your own risk.</p><p>If and when our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number
    and/or Social Security number), that information will be encrypted and protected with encryption software called
    SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as
    Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open. To learn
    more about SSL, follow this link: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openssl.org">http://www.openssl.org</a>.
</p><p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we will use commercially reasonable efforts
    to protect personal user information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for
    example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) will be granted access to personally
    identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices.
    The servers that are used to store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p><p>If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to
    <a class="" href="mailto:info@greatschools.net">info@greatschools.net</a>
    .
</p><h4>Compromise of Security</h4><p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, GreatSchools Inc. will
    promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification
    procedures set forth in this Privacy Statement, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p><h4>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h4><p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes or if a user no longer desires our service, we will
    endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.</p><h4>Notification of Changes</h4><p>As we continue to develop our Web site, this privacy policy likely will change. We will post all changes to this
    policy on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's effective date. We therefore
    encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy.</p><p>We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If at
    any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the
    time it was collected, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use
    their information in this new manner. </p><h4>Login Security</h4><p>When you choose a password, either as a principal for your Enhanced School Profile or as a parent to join a
    GreatSchools community, the password is stored on the password-protected GreatSchools Inc. server. However,
    because Internet communications are generally not secure, you should be aware that when you send your password
    across the Internet to us, there is a possibility that an experienced hacker could intercept your password.
    However, we have no evidence to date that password information presents a serious security threat to warrant
    using a secure shell for this transaction.</p><h4>A Notice About Our Advertisers</h4><p>GreatSchools allows advertising by third parties. GreatSchools does not control linking practices of advertisers
    or sponsors and does not monitor or claim responsibility for any content or privacy practices of such Web sites.
    Once you have clicked on an advertisement and have left the GreatSchools site, you must read the privacy policy
    of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your personal information will be handled. </p><p>GreatSchools may offer contests, sweepstakes, and promotions that are sponsored by third-party advertisers or
    sponsors. These third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to
    participate in the activity. GreatSchools does not control the third parties' use of information. </p><p>GreatSchools may use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on our site. Some of these
    ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors). We do not have access to these
    cookies or any information that they contain. The GreatSchools privacy policy does not cover any use of
    information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you. For more information on ad serving, please
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">click here</a>. </p><p>GreatSchools is currently contracted with TACODA, Inc., a third party, to track and analyze anonymous usage and
    browsing patterns of our users in order to deliver advertisements that are most likely to be of interest to you.
    TACODA utilizes certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages to you and to collect
    anonymous information about your visit to our Web site, including your IP address and information from cookies it places on
    your computer. All data collected by TACODA on behalf of our Web sites is owned by GreatSchools. For
    more information about TACODA'S privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to
    <a href="http://www.tacoda.com/privacy_policy.html" target="_blank">www.tacoda.com/privacy_policy.html</a>.
</p><h4>A Notice About External Links</h4><p>You will find links from GreatSchools to independently owned, controlled, and/or managed Web sites
    whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our visitors. Additionally you'll see links
    from advertisers, sponsors and other partners that may use GreatSchools' logo as part of a co-branding
    agreement. </p><p>In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations
    connected with these sites. We don't control the content of these links. These other sites may send you their
    own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of
    our Web sites, we do not control these cookies or the content of these third parties. </p><p>GreatSchools has partnered with other companies to provide certain services. In some cases, you may see
    GreatSchools' logo on another company's site. GreatSchools does not share any of your personally identifiable
    information with these partners and they do not share any information with us. </p><p>Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your
    browser), the use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site
    you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites
    via a link from that site's home page, you should contact the site directly for more information. </p><p>We specifically recommend that parents or teachers monitor any new sites before children connect to them. </p><h4>Public Forums</h4><p>GreatSchools makes it possible for our users to share information through options such as school reviews, article
    feedback and message boards. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes
    public information. Consequently, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal
    information.</p><h4>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</h4><p> Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that
    reason, GreatSchools does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information
    through the Web site from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our Web
    site is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then
    please do not use or access the Web site at any time or in any manner. If
    GreatSchools learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13
    years of age has been collected through the Web site without verified parental
    consent, then GreatSchools will take the appropriate steps to delete this
    information.</p><h4>Notification Procedures</h4><p>It is the policy of GreatSchools to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for
    marketing or other business related purposes, to our customers or Web site users, via email notice, written or hard
    copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Web site page, www.greatschools.net, as determined
    by GreatSchools in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GreatSchools reserves the right to determine
    the form and means of providing notifications to our customers or Web site users.</p><br><p>Updated April 2, 2008</p></div><div class="" id="footer"><div id="footerAd"></div><div class="" id="navFooter"><ul class="navColumns"><li class="first"><div><a rel="nofollow" href="/modperl/go/TX">Find the Right School</a></div><ul><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/modperl/go/TX">Compare Schools</a></li><li><a href="/city/Plano/TX">Plano Schools</a></li><li><a href="/content/schoolChoiceCenter.page">School Choice Tips</a></li><li><a href="/content/movingWithKids.page">Moving with Kids</a></li></ul></li><li class="second"><div><a rel="nofollow" href="/content/allArticles.page">Grade-By-Grade Support</a></div><ul><li><a href="/preschool/">Preschool</a></li><li><a href="/articles/33/Kindergarten">Kindergarten</a></li><li><a href="/articles/32/First-Grade">First Grade</a></li><li><a href="/articles/34/Second-Grade">Second Grade</a></li><li><a href="/articles/35/Third-Grade">Third Grade</a></li><li><a href="/articles/52/Fourth-Grade">Fourth Grade</a></li><li><a href="/articles/53/Fifth-Grade">Fifth Grade</a></li><li><a href="/articles/54/Middle-School">Middle School</a></li><li><a href="/articles/104/High-School">High School</a></li></ul></li><li class="third"><div><a href="/content/allArticles.page">Education Topics</a></div><ul><li><a href="/content/tutoring_Homework_Help.page">Homework</a></li><li><a href="/content/tutoring_Homework_Help.page">Tutoring</a></li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/search/search.page?c=topic&amp;q=bullying&amp;search_type=0">Bullying</a></li><li><a href="/content/specialNeeds.page">Learning Disabilities</a></li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/search/search.page?c=topic&amp;q=standardized+tests&amp;search_type=0">Standardized Testing</a></li><li><a href="/content/countdownToCollege.page">College Prep</a></li><li><a href="/content/healthyKids.page">Healthy Kids</a></li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/cgi-bin/newsletters/TX/">Free Newsletters</a></li></ul></li><li class="fourth"><div><a href="http://community.greatschools.net">Parent Community</a></div><ul><li><a href="http://community.greatschools.net/q-and-a">Q&amp;A</a></li><li><a href="http://community.greatschools.net/groups">Groups</a></li><li><a href="http://community.greatschools.net/advice">Advice</a></li><li><a href="http://community.greatschools.net/q-and-a/browse?sort=timestamp&amp;page=1&amp;order=desc&amp;tab=local">Plano Local</a></li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/community/loginOrRegister.page">Join!</a></li></ul></li><li class="fifth"><div><a rel="nofollow" href="/about/aboutUs.page">About GreatSchools</a></div><ul><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/about/aboutUs.page">About Us</a></li><li><a href="http://blogs.greatschools.net/BillsBlog" target="_blank">Bill's Blog</a></li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/about/pressRoom.page">Media Room</a></li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/promo/webbyAwardWinner.page">Our Awards</a></li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/cgi-bin/static/jobs.inc">Jobs</a></li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/about/partnerOpportunities.page#advertise">Advertisers</a></li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/about/partnerOpportunities.page#license">License Our Content</a></li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/about/linkToUs.page">Link to GreatSchools</a></li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="/cgi-bin/feedback/TX">Contact Us</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><div id="footerGS"><div id="footerImg"><a rel="nofollow" href="/promo/webbyAwardWinner.page"><img src="/res/img/promo/webby/footer.gif" alt="The Webby Awards - Best Family and Parenting Site - 2007 People's Voice Awards"></a></div><div id="footerContent"><div id="footerText">
