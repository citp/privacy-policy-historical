If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you should contact our management team by emailing <a href="mailto:info@greatschools.net">info@greatschools.net</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or feel that your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you can call us at (415) 977-0700.</p><h4>Information Collection and Use</h4><p>GreatSchools Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. GreatSchools Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways other than as disclosed in this statement.</p><h4>Cookies</h4><p>GreatSchools Inc. deposits cookies on users' hard drives. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. By setting a cookie on our site, a user does not have to log in a password more than once and saves time while on our site. Users who reject the cookie may still use GreatSchools.net, but they may be limited in some areas of our site. </p><p>Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience. Some of the information about how our users experience our site, such as page views and specific pages visited, is logged by a third-party marketing company on our behalf, using cookies and Web beacons. Web beacons help us understand information such as what browsers our users have so that we are able to develop our site to best support our users. We control how this data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, you can "opt out" by clicking here: <a target="_new" href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/policy#optout">http://www.omniture.com/privacy#optout</a>.</p><h4>Log Files</h4><p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p><h4>Sharing</h4><p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and sponsors. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p><p>We use third-party vendors to provide services on the Web site, such as sending email messages to subscribers. The information that a user submits on the site will be provided to our vendor on a confidential basis for the sole purpose of delivering GreatSchools' communications to users who have 'opted in' to receive them. Your email address will not be shared with any other third party.</p><p>We may, however, release information provided by a user to the extent it is required to be disclosed pursuant to a valid order or requirement of a governmental agency or court.</p><p>The personal information you provide on the www.greatschools.net Web site will be sent directly to GreatSchools Inc., and will not be retained by any of our partners (such as BVIG, MSN, Yahoo, etc.).  However, if you are on one of our co-branded partner pages (e.g., BVIG, MSN, Yahoo, etc.), the partner may track your page views of the links you click on the page.</p><h4>Links</h4><p>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that GreatSchools Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage our users to be aware of when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p><h4>Newsletters</h4><p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter or other email services, we may ask for contact information such as name and email address. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as child's grade level or ZIP code) but encouraged so that we can provide more personalized service.  This information is not shared with or sold to anyone for any purpose, except in accordance with this privacy policy.</p><p>From time to time, GreatSchools may email our newsletter subscribers a request to complete user surveys and/or events that we believe are of interest. This may include promotions from a related third-party sponsor. GreatSchools will never share your information directly with a third party, except in accordance with this privacy policy.</p><h4>Choice/Opt Out</h4><p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletters or other communications can unsubscribe using the tools provided in every email message we send or from the <a href="/cgi-bin/newsletters/state=CA">subscription management page</a> on the site. </p><h4>User Surveys</h4><p>From time to time, we request information from users and newsletter subscribers via surveys.  Participation in these surveys is voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as ZIP code, grade level). Contact information may be used to notify winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p><h4>Tell a Friend</h4><p>If users elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. GreatSchools Inc. will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. GreatSchools Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact GreatSchools Inc. at <a href="mailto:info@greatschools.net">info@greatschools.net</a> to request the removal of this information from our database.</p><h4>Security</h4><p>This Web site takes commercially reasonable precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, GreatSchools Inc. uses commercially reasonable efforts to protect their information both online and offline.</p><p>If and when our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or Social Security number), that information will be encrypted and protected with encryption software called SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open. To learn more about SSL, follow this link: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openssl.org">http://www.openssl.org</a>. </p><p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) will be granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. The servers that are used to store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p><p>If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:info@greatschools.net">info@greatschools.net</a>.</p><h4>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h4><p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.</p><h4>Notification of Changes</h4><p>As we continue to develop our Web site, this privacy policy likely will change. We will post all changes to this policy on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's effective date. We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy.</p><p>We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this new manner. </p><h4>Principal Login Security</h4><p>When principals choose a password for their Enhanced School Profile, the password is stored on the password-protected GreatSchools Inc. server. However, when principals send their password across the Internet to us, there is a possibility that an experienced hacker could steal the password by sniffing the line on the principal's property or somewhere between the principal's property and the GreatSchools Inc. server. We have not had evidence to date that password information contains a large enough security threat to warrant using a secure shell for this transaction. </p><h4>A Notice About Our Advertisers</h4><p>GreatSchools allows advertising by third parties. GreatSchools does not control linking practices of advertisers or sponsors and does not monitor or claim responsibility for any content or privacy practices of such Web sites. Once you have clicked on an advertisement and have left the GreatSchools site, you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your personal information will be handled. </p><p>GreatSchools may offer contests, sweepstakes, and promotions that are sponsored by third-party advertisers or sponsors. These third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the activity. GreatSchools does not control the third parties' use of information. </p><p>GreatSchools may use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on our site. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they contain. The GreatSchools privacy policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you. For more information on ad serving, please <a target="_blank" href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">click here</a>. </p><h4>A Notice About External Links</h4><p>Occasionally, you will find links from GreatSchools to independently owned, controlled, and/or managed Web sites whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our visitors. Additionally you'll see links from advertisers, sponsors and other partners who may use GreatSchools' logo as part of a co-branding agreement. </p><p>In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. We don't control the content of these links. These other sites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our Web sites, we do not control these cookies or the content of these third parties. </p><p>GreatSchools has partnered with other companies to provide certain services. In some cases, you may see GreatSchools' logo on another company's site. GreatSchools does not share any of your personally identifiable information with these partners and they do not share any information with us. </p><p>Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from that site's home page, you should contact the site directly for more information. </p><p>We specifically recommend that children check with their parents or teachers before connecting to any new sites. </p><h4>Public Forums</h4><p>GreatSchools makes it possible for our users to share information through options such as school reviews, article feedback and message boards. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Consequently, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p></div><div id="footer"><div id="footerAd"></div><div id="footerGS"><div class="lowernavbar"><a href="/about/aboutUs.page">About Us</a> |
