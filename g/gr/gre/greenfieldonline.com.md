### Overall Privacy

### Commitment

**Greenfield Online** is an online data collection company focused on providing high quality data to the full-service marketing research industry. We build and maintain large online consumer Panels. You can be assured your privacy and the confidentiality of your information is our number one priority. All of the data that Greenfield Online collects in our research studies report as aggregate information, that is, information about groups - not individuals. Individual information is never reviewed or published, as it is irrelevant to the research conducted by our clients. All individual information provided is held strictly confidential.

### The Information We Gather

Greenfield Online gathers personal information when individuals register to become member of our panels, after registration we ask panel members to provide us with more personal information so that we may invite them to appropriate surveys. To become a panel member, we ask that you fill out a registration survey that gathers some personal and general consumer information. We ask for your email address so that we can send you email invitations to participate in our upcoming surveys. The other information we gather, such as your name, address, gender, birthday, and employment status, is for matching you with the appropriate marketing research projects. Your birthday is used to automatically update your age for us to target age-related marketing groups. We ask you for this information as a means to see if you might qualify for particular projects. All email contact from **Greenfield Online** will be sent to your primary email address that you gave to us upon registration. If you become a panel member, your information (name, address, city, state, and Zip) is also used for the purposes of incentive fulfillment. When you receive a deposit in your account and wish to redeem it, this information is required so that we may send your check to the appropriate recipient address. From time to time, a third party may be used for issuing checks; your personally identifiable information will not be used for any other reason, but to mail you your check. 

If you take a survey or provide us with personal information without being a member of our panel, the only personally identifiable information we will preserve is your email address. We do this so we may contact you if you have won a prize or are entitled to an incentive and to limit the number of times that you are eligible to take a survey. Unless you elect to become a member of the **Greenfield Online** panel, we will not contact you for any reason other than to notify you that you have won a prize or are eligible for an incentive. If you are entitled to a prize or an incentive, we will collect and maintain such personally identifiable information, as we are required to maintain or report by virtue of any law or regulation. 

### Use of This Information 

Greenfield Online does not sell or transfer the personally indentifiable information collected about the members of its panels or the individuals that take surveys for us. Information which is personally indentifiable will only be transferred with your prior permission on a case by case basis. If you are a member of the **Greenfield Online** panel, your information is stored in our proprietary database so we may call upon it to determine which people match up with specific research studies. If we think your profile makes you a potential candidate for a study, we will email you an invitation to make you aware of this opportunity. From time to time **Greenfield Online** may use third-party software for email list management and email distribution.
