This Policy describes how GREE International, Inc. ("GREE," "us," or "we") collects, uses, stores, manages and discloses information, including personal information, that our users ("you" or "users") provide or we collect in connection with our websites at [gree.net](http://gree.net/ "click to visit gree.net"), [gree-support.net](http://gree-support.net/ "click for our support site") and [gree-corp.com](http://gree-corp.com/ "click to visit gree-corp.com") (the "Site") or any GREE game or other application or services available on other websites or other third party sources (collectively, the "Service"). Personal information may include, for example, your name, address, telephone number, email address or credit card number.

This Policy applies only to information collected or received by GREE through your use of the Service. Any link to the sites or any third party does not imply that GREE is affiliate with or sponsors that third party. GREE is not responsible for the actions, products or services of any third party, the content of any third party site, or the use or disclosure of any information you provide to any third party.

### Information Collected and How it is Used

The main purposes for which GREE collects your information are:

  * To provide and enhance GREE's games and the Service

We also use (and may provide to third party analytics providers as described below) country-level geographic location information to enforce our Terms of Service, customize the user experience and make recommendations to you.

We may also give you the opportunity to opt-in to location-based services, which utilize a device's GPS coordinates. You may opt-out of these location services via the settings on your device.

GREE provides games and the Service via third party marketplaces, such as Apple's App Store and Google's Android Market. These marketplaces may collect information about you or receive information from us in the course of providing or analyzing their services.

You should review these third parties' terms of service and privacy policies, which are separate from GREE's.

### Cookies, Web Beacons and Third Party Advertisements

A "cookie" is a data file that is transferred to a user's computer and is intended to identify that computer. Cookies also are used to maintain information about a user's visit to a site or game, such as user names, passwords and individual preferences. The Service sends cookies to your computer when you access a GREE game or view content of a game. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to your personal information. That information may be used for a variety of purposes including improving the quality and ease of use of the Service and making recommendations more specific to you.

GREE may also collect information using "Web beacons" or "gifs." These are electronic images that may be used on the Site or in email to deliver cookies, count visits and to tell if an email has been opened and actioned.

The Service may include third party advertisements. These ads may be served by third party advertising companies that deliver cookies to your computer, allowing these companies to track the ads. As a result, these companies will be able to recognize your computer when they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

### Information for Opting-Out of Cookies and Web Beacons

You may click on the following link: [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/ "click to head to networkadvertising.org") (or such other URL as may be specified from time to time) to learn more about behavioral advertising and for information on how to opt-out of the use of cookies or Web beacons. Please note that opting out of cookies or Web beacons may prevent you from being able to access or use certain features of the Service.

### Advertisements

GREE games may be advertised in other applications. After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our game, you will become a user of the Service. In order to prevent fraud and verify the installs, a UDID may be shared with the advertiser.

### Changing or Deleting Your Information

You may change or delete information by following the process provided in the GREE game. If you delete all of your information, your account may become deactivated. You may opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt-out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations.

Under California law, California Residents who have an established business relationship with us may choose to opt out of the disclosure of personal information about them to third parties for such third parties' direct marketing purposes. As described above, our policy is not to disclose your personal information to a third party for direct marketing purposes without your approval. You may also choose to opt-out after granting approval. If you choose to opt-out at any time after granting approval, please inform us by following the process described on our support page located at [http://gree-support.net](http://gree-support.net/ "gree support")

### International Transfer of Information

GREE may transfer information (including personal information) that we collect about you to our affiliates or to other third parties that may be outside of your country. If you are located in the European Union or in another country or jurisdiction, such locations may have laws governing data collection and use that differ from U.S. law. Please note that you are transferring information and allowing GREE or others to transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. and Japan and the use and disclosure of information about you, including personal information, as described in this Policy.

### Security

GREE implements reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information and is committed to protect customer information.

It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your account, the Site allows you to ask for instructions on how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), the transmission of that information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology ("SSL").

Although GREE takes reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our websites and records, no Internet transmission is completely secure. Accordingly, GREE cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We strongly recommend that you take steps to keep your personal information secure (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If you have questions about security, please visit our support page located at [http://gree-support.net](http://gree-support.net/ "gree support")

### Modifications to this Policy

GREE may modify this Policy from time to time. We will post all changes to this Policy on this page or another location on the Site and the modified policy will specify its effective date. You are obligated to check the Site to confirm whether the Policy has been modified.
