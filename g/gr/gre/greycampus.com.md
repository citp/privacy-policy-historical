# Privacy Policy | GreyCampus

We respect your right to privacy and hate spam as much as you do.

The goal of this policy is to make explicit, the information we gather on our customers and users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is, unfortunately, longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.

Our Privacy Commitment:

GreyCampus has never sold your information to someone else for advertising or made money by showing you other people's ads, and we never will. This has been our approach since inception, and we remain committed to it. This policy tells you the purpose and who we are, what information we do collect from you, what we do with it, who can access it, and what you can do about it.
