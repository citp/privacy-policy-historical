# Privacy Statement | GREedge

**Privacy Statement**

GREedge has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the GREedge web site (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement at any time, so please visit GREedge regularly to review our privacy statement.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you can contact GREedge by emailing to [info@greedge.com](mailto:info@greedge.com) , or by calling +91 98844 53276

**Collected Information**

We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the "Services") to give us contact information, such as their name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, Examination Dates, Mobile Number and model etc. to use the service. We also receive and may store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses [www.greedge.com](http://www.greedge.com/ "www.GREedge.com"). More information on our use of "cookies" can be found below.

GREedge uses the information that we collect to set up the Services for our customers. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Adaptive Learning Service that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to [info@greedge.com](mailto:info@greedge.com). We may also email information regarding updates to the Adaptive Learning Service or company, and will send a Student Newsletter.

In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, experience with our products and services, and more detailed contact preferences. Customers and visitors always have the option of choosing not to provide us with this information.

Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, we do not disclose to third parties the information provided. All financial and billing information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Adaptive Learning Service. This billing information is not used by GREedge for marketing or promotional purposes. GREedge uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary uses the information for the sole purpose of credit card processing.

GREedge may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Adaptive Learning Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.

**Special Relationships**

GREedge has a number of relationships with business partners with whom we may share your personal information for the purpose of providing a service, fulfilling an order or completing a transaction. For example, we use certain vendors for the purpose of providing credit card transaction and check processing services. These vendors verify your purchase information, such as credit card number or checking account number, and authorize your transaction. In doing so, they have access to data about users, but they are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose. We also strongly urge you to read the privacy policy of our business partner at the business partner's site.

**Cookies**

GREedge uses software tags called "cookies" to identify customers when they visit our site. Cookies are used to remember user preferences and maximize performance of our services. The information we collect with cookies is not sold, rented, or shared with any outside parties. Users who disable their Web browser's ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Website but will not be able to successfully use our Adaptive Learning Service.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by GREedge only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

*Third Party Cookies:* We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our website to help us administer our website and improve its quality.

All data collected by such third parties on behalf of GREedge is used only to provide us with information on site usage and is not shared with any other third parties.

**Web Beacons**

Web pages may contain an electronic file called a web beacon, that allows a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. GREedge uses web beacons in the following ways:

Within the GREedge web sites

  * GREedge uses web beacons within the GREedge web sites in order to count users and to recognize users by accessing GREedge cookies.


  * Being able to access GREedge cookies allows us to personalize your experience when you visit GREedge web sites that are located both on and off of the GREedge domain.



**HTML email**

GREedge's practice is to include web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages (messages that include graphics) that GREedge, or its agents, sends in order to determine which email messages were opened and to note whether a message was acted upon.

In general, any file served as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. GREedge may also include web beacons from other companies within pages served by GREedge so that GREedge's advertisers may receive auditing and reporting.
