# The Green PolkaDot Box®

**Green PolkaDot Box (“GPDB”) and its Health Merchants, including this store,  **know you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy.  **By visiting this GPDB Health Merchant platform you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.**

 **Information You Give Us:**  
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our store and communicating with you. We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

 **Automatic Information:**  
We use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our store or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of this website.

 **Information We Share:**  
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. In such cases, they may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

 **Protection of Green Polka Dot Box and Others:**  
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Green PolkaDot Box and our Health Merchants, including the owners of this store, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

 **Information Security:**  
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
