###  Our use of cookies and other information gathering technologies

**3.1 About Cookies**

3.1.1 Cookies are small (4Kb) text files that are placed on your computer or device by websites that you visit. Cookies allow a website to ‘remember’ you either for the duration of your visit – session cookies – or between visits – persistent cookies. Cookies, therefore, can expire at the end of session or can persist for days, months or even years. The persistence of a cookie is under the control of the website that sets it.

3.1.2 Cookies can be used for many purposes but typically are used to remember who you are between pages on a website or for storing your preferences and generally improving your experience of a website.

3.1.3 Cookies can be set by the website you are visiting – first party cookies – or by other websites that are using another website to host content – third-party cookies. If a website embedded, say, a YouTube video, YouTube may well set a cookie when the video is viewed, this would be a ‘third-party’ cookie.

**3.2 Managing cookies**

3.2.1 Most web browsers allow at least a degree of control over cookies through their settings. You can opt to receive an alert whenever a cookie is set or even to disallow the setting of cookies altogether. You can also delete all existing cookies. 

3.2.2 For information about how to manage or delete cookies for you particular browser, please refer to the browser’s documentation, Alternatively, you can visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/), which has comprehensive information on how to manage cookies on a wide variety of desktop browsers. 

3.2.3 Note, many websites use Adobe Flash Player to deliver video content to their users. Adobe utilise their own cookies, which are not manageable through your browser settings. The cookies are used by the Flash Player for various purposes, such as storing preferences or tracking users.

**3.3 Use of Cookies on the Great Run Website**

3.3.1 Recent legislation (The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 as amended in 2011) requires websites based in the EU to:

3.5.2 By choosing to accept their use, a cookie is placed on the visitor’s computer so that the Great Run website can ‘remember’ the visitor’s preference. On subsequent visits to the website, if the presence of the cookie is detected the notice will not appear.

However, if you browse the Great Run website having opted to disallow cookies you will still be able to use the website but certain features and functionality will be lost.

3.5.6 If you choose to ignore the notice but continue using the website, depending on the settings on your browser, cookies will be set.
