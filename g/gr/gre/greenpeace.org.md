# Greenpeace Privacy Policy

Greenpeace believes you have a fundamental right to privacy on the web, and we work to protect your security online as vigorously as possible. |   
---  
Greenpeace UK is raided for evidence about anti-nuclear activities in 1995.   
This policy governs all pages hosted at greenpeace.org. It does not apply to pages hosted by other organisations to which we may link and whose privacy policies may differ. 

For the purposes of this policy, the term "supporter" refers to someone who has given a financial donation via our secure server. "Cyberactivist" refers to someone who has joined one or more of our cyberactivist mailing lists. 

We do not collect personally identifiable information on our web site unless you voluntarily choose to give it to us via an electronic mail message, a phone call, by signing up as a supporter or a cyberactivist, or by postal mail. Even when you choose to give us information, we keep it confidential, and we bind suppliers who work with us by these conditions as well. 

We do not sell or rent web-generated mailing lists or other personally identifiable information outside Greenpeace. Greenpeace does not share or otherwise disclose its cyberactivist lists to other organisations. 

We do not provide mailing lists to outside agencies unless they agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

We will never send you unsolicited materials as a result of participating in a cyberaction. 

If you sign up as a cyberactivist or participate in an online action such as signing a petition, sending an e-mail, letter, or fax, you may be given the option to participate in future on-line actions, to receive news of actions results, to receive a newsletter or further information, or to be invited to contribute to Greenpeace. You will always be given the option to decline any or all of those choices. 

If you become a supporter of Greenpeace you may be given the option to participate in on-line actions or to receive a newsletter or further information. Again, you will always be given the option to decline. 

When participating in an online action, you are not always anonymous to our target. Corporations and Governments which receive e-mail or fax communications via our cyberactions will sometimes respond to your personal e-mail or physical address if you have provided these. If you believe your private information has been gathered or disclosed by one of our targets as a result of participating in a Greenpeace action online, please contact us. 

We maintain some records of individuals who contact us for further information or help in case we need to contact them later or provide further information to them in the future. However, we do not provide this information to anyone else unless you give us your permission, and we do not use this information for other purposes. 

Our site is hosted on a variety of servers. Information collected for fundraising purposes is collected on a server we own and maintain. The main server is housed with a hosting company whose privacy policies conform to our own. Information in our website logs is not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link that information with the individuals that actually browse the site. The server collects information about the date and time in which our web site was accessed and the internet address of the server from which you linked to our site. We may also track, anonymously, a user's movement within the site. We use this data to improve our site performance and to evaluate traffic statistics, such as the times of day and days of week at which we see peak traffic, and to assess the relative popularity of different areas of the site. 

A cookie is a tiny element of data that our site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive. Our web site uses cookies to customise certain options. For example, when you choose a language we store a unique, anonymous and encrypted amount of data that allows our servers to keep track of your choice, so you get that language the next time you return to our site. This small amount of information does NOT contain any private information stored on your computer. You may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, or to disable cookies altogether. We do not use cookies to track your content choices. 

We are committed to providing our supporters and cyberactivists with ways of monitoring and amending the information you provide to us, and are currently developing the tools to do so. 

Our Join page uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): a security protocol that provides communications privacy over the Internet. The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. While on a secure page, such as our giving form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web broswers such as Opera, Netscape Navigator, and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

You can learn more about SSL at: 

<http://home.netscape.com/security/techbriefs/ssl.html>

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of your information, not just the sensitive information like a credit card number, is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our donation officers) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, all Greenpeace employees who handle membership information are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Our employees are notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our supporters' information is protected. 

Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked door. 

If you have any questions about the information we maintain about your supporter details please contact [supporter-services@ams.greenpeace.org](mailto:supporter-services@ams.greenpeace.org)

Our security measures and this policy are reviewed on a regular basis. If you have any questions relating to this policy, please address them to:
