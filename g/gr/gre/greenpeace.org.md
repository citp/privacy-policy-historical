We want to ensure that you enjoy browsing our website. In order to enhance your experience and collect information about your use of our site, we place “cookies” onto your computer.

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie:

  * cookies allow our systems to recognise the user’s device and make any presettings immediately available
  * as soon as a user accesses the platform, a cookie is sent to the hard disk of the respective user’s computer



Cookies are useful because they:

  * allow a website to recognise a user’s device and to target the content displayed to the user’s interests
  * help us to improve our website
  * offer you a better service more tailored to your requirements
  * enable us to recognise your device when you return to our website
  * store information about your favourite activities on the website, thereby allowing us to tailor our website to your individual interests. This may, for example, include advertising according to your personal interests and accelerate the rate at which we can deal with your queries

### **Types of cookies**

There are two broad types of cookies – ‘first party cookies’ and ‘third party cookies’:

  * **_First party cookies_** are cookies that are served directly by the website operator to your computer, and are often used to recognise your computer when it revisits that site and to remember your preferences as you browse the site. Basically, these are our cookies.
  * **_Third party cookies_** are served by a service provider on behalf of the website operator, and can be used by the service provider to recognise your computer when you visit _other_ websites. Third party cookies are most commonly used for website analytics or advertising purposes.

Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites.

### **Use of Google Analytics**

Greenpeace uses Google Analytics to gather visitors’ use of our website and analyze the data to help us maintain and improve the design of our website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users’ computers.

**Should you not be willing to get the analytics cookies, please change you cookies settings above (‘change your cookies preferences’).**  

As mentioned before, Google Analytics cookies used in this website are **_utma, _utmb, _utmc, _utmz, _ga and _gid** – and they **all collect information in an anonymous form** , including the number of visitors to the site, browser ClientID (to identify returning users, for example), where visitors come to the site from and the pages they visited. Here’s the[ privacy overview of Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245), the [Google Analytics Cookie Usage on Websites](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage?hl=en-GB) and here [how to easily opt-out of Google Analytics cookies](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

As of May 2018, Google Analytics introduced the [Data Retention controls](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7667196), giving organizations the ability to set the amount of time before user-level and event-level data stored by Google Analytics is automatically deleted from Analytics’ servers.

Such retention period applies to user-level and event-level data associated with cookies, user-identifiers (e.g., User-ID) and advertising identifiers (not applicable in Greenpeace websites anyway). **For Greenpeace International, the Data Retention control for Google Analytics is set to 26 months**. Once again, Analytics will not collect the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the internet.

Besides, it is important to mention that Google stores websites traffic information which have Google Analytics tracking code.[ Check Google’s privacy policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) and how to [opt-out of Google Analytics cookies](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

You can install the “[Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)” to prevent information about your visits to our website being sent to Google Analytics.

### **Use of social networks sharing buttons and widgets**

Beside the [customized HTML buttons](https://schier.co/blog/2014/10/22/pure-html-share-buttons.html) we installed to allow you to share Greenpeace content on Facebook and Twitter, we may embed widgets from [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/), [Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-cookies#), [Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/1896641480634370?ref=ig), [YouTube](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/pages/cookies/05-2018) and other social media on our website to provide an enhanced experience.

These social networking  widgets come from web servers which may track your behaviour on our website and may combine this with other information about you originating from other websites. You can install a browser add-ons like “[Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)” for Chrome or “Disconnect” for[ Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jeoacafpbcihiomhlakheieifhpjdfeo?hc=search&hcp=main) and[ Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/6016894/) to control some (the first) or disable them (the second).
