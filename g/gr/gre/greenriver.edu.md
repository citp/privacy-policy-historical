### Section D. Public Access to Information

In the State Of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.

All of the information collected at this site becomes public records that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists. [RCW 42.56.070](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.070 "RCW 42/56/070") states that:

Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of the Public Records Act or other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records.

To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by RCW 42.56.210 and [42.56.320](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.320 "42.56.320"), an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with [RCW 42.56.210](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.210 "RCW 42.56.210") and RCW 42.56.320 when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.
