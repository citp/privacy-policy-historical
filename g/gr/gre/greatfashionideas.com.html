Your use of our Web Site indicates to us that You have read and accepted our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 MUST NOT PROVIDE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS, TO GREATFASHIONIDEAS. IF GREATFASHIONIDEAS IS NOTIFIED IT HAS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT A MINOR UNDER THE AGE OF 18, THAT INFORMATION WILL BE PROMPTLY DELETED FROM OUR DATABASE.</p>
<h2>Applicability</h2>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the Web Site owned and/or operated by, and upon which Greatfashionideas has placed a “link” which, when “clicked”, transfers You to this Privacy Policy. It is not applicable to any web sites which are not owned and operated by Greatfashionideas. While on our Web Site, You may encounter links to these web sites or online material. If You “click” on a link to such a third party, the “click” takes You off our Web Site and transfers You to a third party’s web site, which is beyond Greatfashionideas’ control. These other web sites may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the Web Site, and does not cover any information collected by any other web site. We encourage You to review the privacy policy of any other web site You visit.</p>
<p>In addition, please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information You may disclose publicly in any chat rooms, message boards, or similar web pages. You should keep in mind that whenever You publicly disclose information about yourself online – for example, via message boards or chat rooms – that information could be collected and used by people that You do not know. In addition, certain message boards and similar user forums may display IP addresses (as defined below) along with the message poster’s name and message. Greatfashionideas bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may disclose on the message boards, chat areas or other user forums, if any, on the Web Site.</p>
<h2>Information Greatfashionideas Collects</h2>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>&nbsp;Personally identifiable information is information that could reasonably be used to identify You personally (such as Your name, address, birth date or e-mail address), which we refer to in this Privacy Policy as “PII.” Generally, You may browse our Web Site without providing us with PII. However, there may be times when we ask You to provide us with certain PII, such as when You choose to register with our Web Site and/or for newsletters or choose to participate in an online contest, sweepstakes, survey or voting procedure. we may also ask You to provide us with demographic information or information regarding Your interests, hobbies or similar information. Greatfashionideas reserves the right, at any time, to add features to our Web Site that require You to register or otherwise provide PII, including credit card information, or to require registration to access our Web Site, or a portion of our Web Site. You can choose not to provide certain information, but You may not be able to take advantage of, or participate in, some of the Web Site’s features. We may combine the information we collect with information available from other sources, including information received from promotional partners or other third parties. We may provide You the opportunity to e-mail a friend an article, electronic greeting card or other special feature from our Web Site. The e-mail addresses You supply us for those activities will be used to send the requested e-mail and will not be used to send You or Your friend any other e-mail communications.</p>
<p><strong>The Web Site does not knowingly collect PII from children under thirteen (13) years of age:</strong>&nbsp;This is not a web site directed to children under the age of 13, and Greatfashionideas does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age at the Web Site. If You are under 13 years of age, do not send any information about yourself to Greatfashionideas. If Greatfashionideas discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided the Web Site with PII, Greatfashionideas will delete that child’s PII from its system.<br>

We also may determine what technology is available through Your browser in order to serve You the most appropriate version of a web page.

<p><strong>IP Addresses:</strong>&nbsp;An IP address is a number that is assigned to Your computer or network when You are on the Internet. When visitors request pages from our Web Site, our servers log the visitor’s IP address. We may collect IP addresses for a variety of internal purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the number of visits to different pages on our Web Site.

<p><strong>Security:</strong>&nbsp;Greatfashionideas takes steps to secure the data You submit to us, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our user data. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
