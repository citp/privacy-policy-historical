# Privacy Policy - GreenGeeks®

GreenGeeks LLC, referred to in this document as ("GreenGeeks").

GreenGeeks respects the privacy of its customers and visitors and is committed to protecting the personal information of its customers and visitors. This Privacy Policy covers the site [www.GreenGeeks.com](http://www.greengeeks.com/). We collect no personally identifiable information about you when you visit our site unless you choose to provide that information to us or as specifically outlined in this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Service ("TOS") Agreement found at [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/legal/tos.php).

**GreenGeeks does NOT trade, rent or sell your personal information to any other organization or third party.**

This Policy describes our general principles for the collection and use of information from customers and visitors to our websites. We want to ensure that you understand how we will and will not use the information you entrust to us. In order to fully understand your rights we encourage you to read this Policy.

For visitors, we've structured our websites so that, in general, you can visit us on Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. 

For prospective and existing customers and partners, once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your relationship with GreenGeeks. 

GreenGeeks has security measures in place to help prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. When you place an order online, your information, including your credit card number, is protected using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology. This encrypts order data and is designed to aid in ensuring the accuracy and security of that customer information. 

GreenGeeks does not sell products or services for purchase by children. Customers must be at least 18 years of age. Any individual under the age of 18 ("Minor") must have a parent or guardian accept the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/legal/tos) in order for the Minor to become a Customer. If you are under 18, we strongly encourage you to use our website only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

GreenGeeks reserves the right to change this Policy simply by posting such changes on our site. We encourage you to periodically check our site for changes to this Policy since your continued use of the site following any changes to this Policy will be deemed to constitute your acceptance of such change. The operative and effective version of this Policy will be the latest version available on the site.
