## Cookies

Cookies are small files placed on your browsing device by the websites you visit to help them improve your browsing experience.

You can find out more about cookies and how they work at the [All About Cookies website](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

### Essential usage

Some of our services require cookies to be enabled in order to function. These temporary files remember certain information which could not otherwise be stored as you move between pages on our site, e.g. our [on-demand prospectus](http://www.gre.ac.uk/prospectus) uses cookies to remember which of our programmes you have added to your "basket" when you request the prospectus. These cookies are only stored as long as your visit to our site and are not used to track any other information about you.

Our personalised websites (e.g. [Greenwich VIP](http://www.gre.ac.uk/vip)) similarly use cookies to maintain details of your settings between pages, and to provide anonymised data about usage. When you sign in to use these services you are providing consent for these cookies to be set.

### Targeted advertising

Like many businesses we use paid advertisements to increase awareness of our services. Some of these advertisements are "targeted" towards people who have viewed our site previously, or have viewed sites relevant to our services.

In order to do this we provide information to the our advertising company, which they use to provide you with advertising that should be more relevant to your interests. We do this by placing a small pixel on certain pages which are read by the advertising company and interact with cookies that have been set on pages where the adverts appear. This information can not be used to identify you personally.

You can find out more about the targeted advertising we use, including how to switch this off in your browser, at the [Specific Media website](http://specificmedia.com/privacy).
