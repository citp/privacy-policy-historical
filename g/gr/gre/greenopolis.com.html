<strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
</p>
<p>
PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS OF SERVICE FOR  THE SITE CAREFULLY. YOUR USE OF THIS SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO SUCH  PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF SERVICE.
</p>
<p>
WM Organic Growth, Inc. ("WMOG," "we",  "our" or "us") maintains the site located at the domain  greenopolis.com ("Site"). This Privacy Policy describes the types of  information collected from you, what we do with it, with whom we share it, and  how you can correct or change such information. It is your responsibility to review  this Privacy Policy carefully, especially before providing any Personal  Information through the Site. This Site is operated in and controlled from the United States of    America. If you have any questions about this  Privacy Policy or Site please contact us at the address at the end of this  policy. <br>
<strong>Types of  Information Collected</strong> <br>
Personally Identifiable Information ("Personal  Information") is any information that can be used to identify a specific  individual, such as your name, email address, home address, phone number and  credit card information. This Site collects Personal Information when you  interact with certain features of the Site; for example, when you subscribe for  newsletters; register for membership services such as chat rooms or message boards;  participate in chat rooms, blogs or other user forums; respond to polls or  surveys; purchase merchandise via the Site; register for sweepstakes, contests  and other promotional opportunities; or seek help from our customer service  departments. We may also obtain Personal Information from reputable third  parties, such as credit agencies.<br>
Non-Personal Information is information that does not identify  you specifically, including data collected automatically through the operation  of the Site. We may collect site usage data (such as which Site pages you visit  and in what sequence) through the use of various technologies. For example, we  collect IP addresses from individuals who visit the Site. An IP address is a  number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing  the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages,  automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a  page from a website, its servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses  to any Personal Information, so although your session will be logged, you will  remain anonymous to us and the Site. <br>
We may also collect password information from you when you log  in, as well as computer and connection information such as browser type or version.  During some visits, we may use software tools, such as Javascript, to measure  and collect session information, including page response times, download  errors, time spent on certain pages, page interaction information, and methods  used to browse away from the page.<br>
<strong>Member Profiles</strong> <br>
Greenopolis.com is an online adult social networking community  that allows people to connect by communicating, sharing and making new friends.  To accomplish this, members create their own profiles, which contain the  Personal Information that the members choose to include. This information may  include such things as: first name or first and last name; gender; age; marital  status; location (e.g., street, city, zip code); education level, and birthday.  The information included in a member's profile will be shown to the people the  member chooses. Each member will have certain choices related to the level of  sharing when creating his/her profile, including: Personal image, Address,  Latitude, Longitude, Languages spoken, Gender, Occupation, Children, Education,  Marital Status, Birth-date and Contact information.<br>
PLEASE NOTE THAT, REGARDLESS OF WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION A  MEMBER CHOOSES TO INCLUDE IN HIS OR HER PROFILE, OR WHAT LEVEL OF SHARING HE OR  SHE CHOOSES, CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT EACH MEMBER WILL BE INCLUDED IN THAT  MEMBER'S "PUBLIC PROFILE," WHICH IS AN ABBREVIATED VERSION OF A  GREENOPOLIS PROFILE. (For example, the public profile may include, without  limitation, the following: Member Since:, Last time logged on, Anything the user  writes in the "About Me", The users friends, Their groups, their  friends). PUBLIC PROFILES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANY USER OF GREENOPOLIS.COM,  WHETHER OR NOT THE USER IS A MEMBER.<br>
<strong>Message Boards,  Chat Rooms, Blogs and Other User Forums</strong> <br>
Please remember that information posted to message boards, chat  rooms, blogs and other user forums becomes public information. Use caution when  posting. Individuals under the age of 18 should be especially careful not to  provide any personally identifiable information when participating in any area  of the Site where postings might become public. Please see our Terms of Service  for the standards of behavior that must be followed when using these portions  of the Site.<br>
<strong>Invitations to  Friends</strong> <br>
Greenopolis.com members can invite friends to join the service  by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. We store the  email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to  the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send  reminders of the invitations. We do not sell these email addresses or use them  to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders.  Recipients of invitations from Greenopolis.com may contact us at <a href="mailto:cancel@greenopolis.com">cancel@greenopolis.com</a> to request the  removal of their information from our database. <br>
Members may also store email addresses of people they know in  their internal greenopolis.com address book and may also choose to send  invitations and other communications to those addresses.<br>
You may prevent greenopolis.com email invitations and other  messages from being sent to any email address you control by sending a single  email with the subject "BLOCK" to <a href="mailto:privacy@greenopolis.com">privacy@greenopolis.com</a>. Please note  that the email must come from the account you wish to block. <br>
<strong>Use of Cookies  and Similar Technologies</strong> <br>
Like many sites, we use "cookies" or other similar  technologies to collect non-Personal Information. A cookie is a small data file  that writes to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit the  Site. Cookies allow the Site to measure traffic activity on the Site and to  improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and  viewing preferences, allowing you to visit "member only" portions of  the Site without re-registering, and tracking the progress and number of  entries in activities that require registration or entry, such as sweepstakes.  Similarly, if you have asked us to send you information about upcoming products  and promotions, using cookies we collect information about which Site pages you  have visited and in what order ("Clickstream Data") that may allow us  to narrow or limit the materials provided to you based on your prior online  activities or preferences. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when  cookies are being sent, but it is possible that some parts of the Site will not  function properly if you do so.<br>
In addition, we may use a service that collects data remotely by  using so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear  GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") embedded in  the Site's content. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel  (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated  with cookies on the visitors' hard drives. This information is non-Personal  Information.<br>
<strong>Our Use of Your  Data</strong> <br>
We will use your Personal Information for the purposes for which  it was provided. For example, if you provide Personal Information to register  for a newsletter, to enter a contest or a sweepstake, or to purchase goods or  services, we will use it to register you for or provide you with those goods or  services. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with  information about features, services and other offerings that may be of  interest to you. We also may send information or offers to selected groups of  Site users on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give those  businesses your name or address. Under certain circumstances (for example if  you win a contest) we may post your Personal Information on the Site. We will  notify you of this possibility when you provide the Personal Information and,  if possible, when the Personal Information is posted.<br>
Cookies and similar tools may be used to relate your use of the Site and  non-Personal Information to Personal Information obtained from you. If any  non-Personal Information is linked with Personal Information, the linked  non-Personal Information will then be treated as Personal Information.<br>
We may also use Personal Information in aggregate form for  purposes of research or analysis. In order to better understand and serve the  users of the Site, Greenopolis.com often conducts research on its customer  demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Information we gather.  Although this aggregated data may be based in part on Personal Information, it  does not identify you personally. Greenopolis.com may share this type of  non-Personal Information with a variety of third parties, including its  affiliates, agents, and current and prospective business partners.<br>
We may use non-Personal Information collected from the Site for  site administration, advertising and promotional purposes, and we may share  such information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities for such  purposes. For example, IP addresses are used for the purposes of system  administration and to provide Non-Personal Information to advertisers about the  volume of use on the Site, and Clickstream Data and demographic Non-Personal  Information may be shared with our advertisers and business partners. We may  also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess technology that  allows the Site to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive  on the Site. This data (including Clickstream Data about your activities on our  Site) may be shared with these companies for this purpose.<br>
<strong>Disclosure of  Personal Information</strong> <br>
We reserve the right to share Personal Information with our  affiliates. If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with our  affiliated companies for their marketing purposes, you may opt-out of such  sharing by contacting us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@greenopolis.com">unsubscribe@greenopolis.com</a> (see "Your Choices" below).<br>
We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to  perform certain business-related functions on our behalf such as hosting  specific portions of the Site, maintaining databases, administering contests,  mailing information and processing payments. When we employ a third party to  perform these functions, that third party will only be provided with the  particular Personal Information it needs to perform its function, and is  required to protect the Personal Information. With your consent, we may also  share Personal Information with pre-screened third parties for their marketing  or promotional purposes. We will provide you with an opportunity to elect or decline  these services or opportunities (see "Your Choices" below). In the  event you have elected to "unsubscribe" from any of our services, we  will share your Personal Information with third parties with whom we jointly  offer such services solely to the extent necessary to ensure that your request  not to receive such communications is honored. In addition, for third-party  sponsored sweepstakes, contests or promotions, we may request Personal  Information from you that may be shared with the sponsor upon request.<br>
In addition, we may disclose Personal Information without  providing you with a choice under the following limited circumstances to: (1)  protect the legal rights, privacy or safety of WM Organic Growth, or its  subsidiaries, affiliates or its or their employees, agents and contractors; (2)  protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites or other  properties; (3) protect against fraud or other illegal activity or for risk  management purposes; (4) respond to inquiries or requests from public authorities;  (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may  sustain; (6) enforce our Terms of Service; or (7) comply with the law or legal  process.<br>
If we sell all or part of this Site or make a sale or transfer  of assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may,  in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your Personal Information to a  third party as part of or in connection with that transaction. Upon such  transfer, the Privacy Policy of the acquiring entity may govern the further use  of your Personal Information.<br>
<strong>Third-Party  Advertising and Links to Other Sites</strong> <br>
This Site may include third-party advertising. These third party  advertisers, or the Internet advertising companies that work on their behalf,  may use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that  appear on our Site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP  address when this happens. They may also use cookies, Javascript, Pixel Tags  and other technologies to deliver advertisements, collect information about the  effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect anonymous information  about your visits to the Site, such as the number of times you have viewed an  ad (but not your name, address, or other Personal Information). For more  information about these specialized cookies and other technologies, and how to  "opt out" of information collection by these companies, we suggest  you visit <a href="http://doubleclick.net/privacy_policy" target="_blank">http://doubleclick.net/privacy_policy</a> or <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>. <br>
Please note that this Site contains links to other sites that  will not follow the same Privacy Policy as our Site. For instance, clicking on  an advertisement or on links or other elements on the Site may take you to an  entirely different site. Links to other sites may use our Site logo or style as  a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to  you and may collect data and make use of that data in ways that this Site would  not. Once you've left this Site, this Privacy Policy will no longer apply to  Personal Information or any other data collected from or provided by you. You should  check the applicable privacy policy to determine how that site will handle such  data.<br>
<strong>Your Choices</strong> <br>
You can use the Site without providing any Personal Information,  but if you decline to provide Personal Information, you may not be able to use  certain services or features. If you have previously provided Personal  Information to the Site and have subscribed to one or more email newsletters or  are receiving emails or other communications from the Site and you do not want  to receive such emails, please discontinue your subscriptions by clicking the  "unsubscribeunsubscribe@greenopolis.com" link at the bottom of any  message and emailing us with your unsubscribe request, or login to your  Greenopolis.com profile page, select Settings to update your notification preferences.  If you ask that we stop using your Personal Information, we will honor that  request. However we will retain records of your Personal Information as needed  in order to comply with applicable federal, state, or local law.<br>

<strong>Data Security  Disclaimer</strong> <br>
We have instituted physical, electronic and procedural  safeguards to store and maintain Personal Information in a secure environment.  For example, when highly confidential information, such as a credit card  number, is transmitted through the Site, it is encrypted by using Secure Socket  Layer (SSL) software. You may also be required to use a password to access  certain pages on the Site where certain types of your information can be  changed or deleted.

You take full responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality of  your password. Although we take reasonable security precautions to secure the  Personal Information that you choose to provide against the loss, misuse,  alteration or unauthorized access of such information, no transmission of data  over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for  third parties not under the control of greenopolis.com to intercept or access  transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect  your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any  Personal Information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your  own risk.
