This Policy refers to the ways in which KATHIMERINES collects, holds, and uses personally identifiable information.

 **BY USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY KATHIMERINES AS SET OUT IN THIS PERSONAL DATA PRIVACY POLICY.**

 **YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT KATHIMERINES MAY PERIODICALLY CHANGE, MODIFY, ADD, REMOVE, OR ADVISE IN ANY WAY THIS PERSONAL DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.**

Our intention is to communicate any changes on this page so that you are always informed about the type of information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we might disclose it.

 **Guarantee of Private Use**

The term “personal data”, as used herein, refers to information such as name, date of birth, postal or email address, which can be used to identify you.

KATHIMERINES will not process your personal data without your consent. However, we reserve the right, in exceptional cases, to process data to the extent permitted or required by law.

In the event that disclosure of personal data to a third party is necessary for any reason, KATHIMERINES will inform you, and will make every effort, when possible, to ensure that the processing of data is in accordance with the purpose and within the limits set out at the beginning of data collection. There are two additional cases in which your personal data may be transmitted to third parties. First, the case of sale, concession, or assignment of the site and the customer data connected to it, which, in any case, will require the purchaser, the person to whom the concession is made, or the transferee to comply with this Personal Data Management Policy. Second, the case where any disclosure of personal data to a third party is required by law, court decision/order, government/administrative act, or due to an investigation.

 **Right of Access**

You have the right to be assured that, in all cases, your personal data will always be up to date. Furthermore, you have the right to request that it be corrected or deleted. Moreover, at any time, you can request that we cease contact and communication with you.
