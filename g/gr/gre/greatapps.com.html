 					<div>
					<p></p>

<p>
					</p><p>
					Thank you for visiting the GreatApps.com Web site (hereinafter “the Site” or “GreatApps.com”) and reviewing our Privacy Policy, effective October 4, 2011.  We take your privacy very seriously and are committed to safeguarding your privacy online.  Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you use GreatApps.com. 
					</p>

<p>
					</p><h4>Overview</h4>
					<p></p>

<p>
					This Privacy Policy (hereinafter “Policy”) governs your use of GreatApps.com and describes the information we collect from you and what may happen to that information.  For example, this Policy will let you know what information we collect from you; what cookies are and how they are used; how your information is used; who is collecting your information; with whom your information may be shared; what options are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information; how you may use other users’ information ("Users"); the types of security precautions in place to protect against loss, misuse, or alteration of your information; how we protect children’s privacy; and what else you should know about your online privacy.  
					</p>

<p>
					Please note that we review our privacy practices from time to time, and that our practices are subject to change.  We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy.  All amended terms shall be automatically effective after they are posted on the Site.
					</p>

<p>
					By visiting the Site, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use or access the Site.  
					</p>

<p>
					</p><h4>What Personally Identifiable Information does GreatApps.com collect?</h4>
					<p></p>

<p>
					The primary purpose of collecting information from you is to allow you to create an account with us so that you can take advantage of all of the tools and features provided on the Site and to provide you with a personalized experience.  We will only collect information about you that we consider necessary to achieve this purpose.  
					</p>

					Generally, GreatApps.com collects personally identifiable information in two ways.  Some information is gathered when you register so that you may receive notifications regarding new apps posted to the Site.  This includes your name, your email, and a self-selected password.  Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.  Please note that registration is NOT required to view the Site but is required to access all of the features and tools of the Site.  It's your decision whether you want to share personally identifiable information with us.  We also collect personal information when you report a problem or issue with our services through the Site’s feedback form or contact form.

					<p></p>

					When your web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, such as GreatApps.com, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This is called your computer's "IP address." (IP stands for "Internet protocol.") For many users accessing the Internet, the IP address will be different every time you log on.  We record the IP Addresses that access GreatApps.com along with related information such as your browser type and operating system. This information helps us, in part, learn about the geographical distribution of our website visitors and the technology they use to access our site so that we can improve our Site.
					</p>

					</p>

					</p>

<p>

					</p>

<p>
					Other:  We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating GreatApps.com’s Terms of Service Agreement or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) GreatApps.com’s rights or property, other Site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

					</p>

					<p></p>

<p>
					Your GreatApps.com registration information is password protected so that only you have access to this personal information.  We recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone.  GreatApps.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or unsolicited email.  If you choose to share your email address (which is used as your log-in name) and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party’s privacy policy.  If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
