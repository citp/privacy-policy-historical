                        <strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, TML may use "cookies",
                        or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique,
                        random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual
                        interests using the Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself
                        (through registration, for example), TML will have no way of knowing who you are,
                        even if TML assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie
                        can contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our
                        Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers
                        may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a
                        process that we do not control.<br>
                        Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's
                        connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site.
                        (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where
                        to send you data -- such as the web pages you view). Your IP address does not identify
                        you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request,
                        to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our
                        site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.</p>

                        <strong>LINK TO THIRD PARTY SITES</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        TML includes links to other websites. Such sites are governed by their respective
                        privacy policies, which are beyond TML control. Once you leave our servers (you
                        can tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser),
                        use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator
                        of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find
                        the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you
                        should contact the site directly for more information.<br>
                        When we present information to our advertisers -- to help them understand our audience
                        and confirm the value of advertising on our website -- it is usually in the form
                        of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our site.<br>
                        When you register with TML, we may contact you from time to time about updation

                    <p>
                        TML shares the sensitive personal information to any third party without obtaining
                        the prior consent of the User in the following limited circumstances:<br>
                        a) When it is requested or required by law or by any court or governmental agency
                        or authority to disclose, for the purpose of verification of identity, or for the
                        prevention, detection, investigation including cyber incidents, or for prosecution
                        and punishment of offences. These disclosures are made in good faith and belief
                        that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcing these Terms; for complying
                        with the applicable laws and regulations.<br>
                        b) TML proposes to share such information within its group companies and officers
                        and employees of such group companies for the purpose of processing personal information
                        on its behalf. We also ensure that these recipients of such information agree to
                        process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy
                        Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>ACCESSING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        When you use TML's websites, we make good faith efforts to provide you, as and when
                        requested by you, with access to your personal information and shall further ensure
                        that any personal information or sensitive personal data or information found to
                        be inaccurate or deficient shall be corrected or amended as feasible, subject to
                        any requirement for such personal information or sensitive personal data or information
                        to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users
                        to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or
                        removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests
                        that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical
                        effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for
                        instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which
                        access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access
                        and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would
                        require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services,
                        after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before
                        they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.

                    <p>
                        <strong>INFORMATION SECURITY</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to
                        or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal
                        reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures,
                        including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against
                        unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.<br>
                        All information gathered on TML is securely stored within the TML controlled database.
                        The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers
                        is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security
                        measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security
                        of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted
                        while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information
                        you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet
                        access.<br>

                        <strong>Facebook Policy</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        I. Features and Functionality
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1. GreetZAP does not violate any law or the rights of any individual or entity,
                        and does not expose Facebook or Facebook users to harm or legal liability as determined
                        by Facebook in our sole discretion. In particular we (if applicable): comply with
                        the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA), and obtain any opt-in consent necessary
                        from users so that user data subject to the VPPA may be shared on Facebook. We represent
                        that any disclosure to Facebook will not be incidental to the ordinary course of
                        our business.
                        <br>
                        2. GreetZAP does not include functionality that proxies, requests or collects Facebook
                        usernames or passwords.<br>
                        3. GreetZAP does not circumvent (or claim to circumvent) our intended limitations
                        on core Facebook features and functionality.
                        <br>
                        4. When we offer a service for a user that integrates user data into a physical
                        product (such as a voice card), we only create a physical product for that user's
                        personal and non-commercial use.
                        <br>
                        5. GreetZAP website offers an explicit "Log Out" option that also logs the user
                        out of Facebook.<br>
                        6. Special provision for apps on Pages: When a user visits our Page, if they have
                        not given explicit permission by authorizing our Facebook app or directly providing
                        information to our Page, we only use information obtained from Facebook and the
                        user's interaction with our Page in connection with that Page.
                        <br>
                        7. GreetZAP does not use or make derivative use of Facebook icons, or use terms
                        for Facebook features and functionality, if such use could confuse users into thinking
                        that the reference is to Facebook features or functionality.
                        <br>
                        8. Reciprocity and Replicating core functionality:
                        <br>
                        (a) Reciprocity: We enable people to easily share their experiences back with people
                        on Facebook.
                        <br>
                        (b) Replicating core functionality: We do not use Facebook Platform to promote,
                        or to export user data to, a product or service that replicates a core Facebook
                        product or service without our permission.
                        <br>
                        9. We do not include data obtained from Facebook in any search engine or directory
                        without their written permission.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>II. Storing and Using Data You Receive From Us</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        1. GreetZAP only requests the data we need to operate our application.<br>
                        2. GreetZAP may cache data that we receive through use of the Facebook API in order
                        to improve our application’s user experience, but also try to keep the data up to
                        date. This permission does not give us any rights to such data.
                        <br>
                        3. We have a privacy policy that tells users what user data we are going to use
                        and how we will use, display, share, or transfer that data. In addition, we will
                        include our privacy policy URL in the App Dashboard, and must also include a link
                        to your app's privacy policy in any app marketplace that provides you with the functionality
                        to do so.
                        <br>
                        4. Subject to certain restrictions, including on use and transfer, users give us
                        their <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/policy/#definitions">basic account information</a> when they connect with our application. For all
                        other data obtained through use of the Facebook API, we obtain explicit consent
                        from the user who provided the data to us before using it for any purpose other
                        than displaying it back to the user on our application.
                        <br>
                        5. GreetZAP does not directly or indirectly transfer any data we receive from Facebook,
                        including user data or Facebook User IDs, to (or use such data in connection with)
                        any ad network, ad exchange, data broker, or other advertising or monetization related
                        toolset, even if a user consents to such transfer or use. By indirectly we mean
                        we cannot, for example, transfer data to a third party who then transfers the data
                        to an ad network. By any data we mean all data obtained through use of the Facebook
                        Platform (API, Social Plugins, etc.), including aggregate, anonymous or derivative
                        data.
                        <br>
                        6. GreetZAP does not use Facebook User IDs for any purpose outside the application
                        (e.g.,infrastructure, code, or services necessary to build and run application).
                        Facebook User IDs may be used with external services that we use to build and run
                        application, such as a web infrastructure service or a distributed computing platform,
                        but only if those services are necessary to running application and the service
                        has a contractual obligation with us to keep Facebook User IDs confidential.
                        <br>
                        7. In case we need an anonymous unique identifier to share outside application with
                        third parties such as content partners, advertisers, or ad networks, we use our
                        <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user/">mechanism</a>. We do not ever share this anonymous unique identifier with a data broker,
                        information broker, or any other service.
                        <br>
                        8. GreetZAP does not sell or purchase any data obtained from Facebook by anyone.
                        Incase if we are acquired by or merge with a third party, we can continue to use
                        user data within application, but we will not transfer data outside your application.
                        <br>
                        9. Incase if we stop using Platform or Facebook disables application, we will delete
                        all information about a user we have received from Facebook unless: (a) it is basic
                        account information; or (b) we have received explicit consent from the user to retain
                        their data.
                        <br>
                        10. GreetZAP does not use a user’s friend list outside application, even if a user
                        consents to such use, but we can use connections between users who have both connected
                        to application.
                        <br>
                        11. GreetZAP will delete all data it receives from us concerning a user if the user
                        asks us to do so, and will provide an easily accessible mechanism for users to make
                        such a request. Facebook may require GreetZAP to delete data we receive from the
                        Facebook API if we violate our terms.
                        <br>
                        12. GreetZAP does not include data received from Facebook concerning a user in any
                        advertising creative, even if a user consents to such use.
                        <br>
                        13. GreetZAP does not give secret key and access tokens to another party, unless
                        that party is an agent acting on our behalf as an operator of your application.
                        You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account identifiers.
                        <br>

                        provided and that we are ultimately responsible for establishing legally compliant
                        restrictions for each country where our app is visible.

                        3. Advertisements and cross-promotions:
