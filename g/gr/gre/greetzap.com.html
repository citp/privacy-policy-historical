                To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use "cookies",
                or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique,
                random number as a user identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual
                interests using the identified computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself
                (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are,
                even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie
                can contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our
                Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers
                may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a
                process that we do not control.

                &nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's
                connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site.
                (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where
                to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify
                you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request,
                to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our
                site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.

                TIL includes links to other websites. Such sites are governed by their respective
                privacy policies, which are beyond our control. Once you leave our servers (you
                can tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser),
                use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator
                of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find
                the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you
                should contact the site directly for more information.<br>
                <br>
                When we present information to our advertisers -- to help them understand our audience
                and confirm the value of advertising on our website -- it is usually in the form
                of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our site. When you register
                with TIL, we contact you from time to time about updation of your content to provide
                the users such features that we believe may benefit you.

            <p>
                TIL shares the sensitive personal information to any third party without obtaining
                the prior consent of the User in the following limited circumstances:</p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                <strong>a)</strong> When it is requested or required by law or by any court or governmental
                agency or authority to disclose, for the purpose of verification of identity, or
                for the prevention, detection, investigation including cyber incidents, or for prosecution
                and punishment of offences. These disclosures are made in good faith and belief
                that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcing these Terms; for complying
                with the applicable laws and regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                <strong>b)</strong> TIL proposes to share such information within its group companies
                and officers and employees of such group companies for the purpose of processing
                personal information on its behalf. We also ensure that these recipients of such
                information agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance
                with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security
                measures.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                <strong>ACCESSING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                When you use TIL's websites, we make good faith efforts to provide you, as and when
                requested by you, with access to your personal information and shall further ensure
                that any personal information or sensitive personal data or information found to
                be inaccurate or deficient shall be corrected or amended as feasible, subject to
                any requirement for such personal information or sensitive personal data or information
                to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users
                to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or
                removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests
                that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical
                effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for
                instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which
                access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access
                and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would
                require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services,
