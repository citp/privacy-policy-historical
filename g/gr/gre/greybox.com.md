### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

We use "cookies" on this website. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a website visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our website and identify repeat visitors to our website. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our website. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website and provide support for the internal operations of the website or some of our online services including apps. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information on our website. 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can, however, reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.

### How Your Personally Identifiable Information Is Protected

The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to attempt to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and improper use. However, please understand that no security measure is perfect or impenetrable and therefore we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personally identifiable information. 

We also protect your personally identifiable information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. 

**Bulletin Boards and Chat Areas:** Users of the Services are solely responsible for the content of messages they post on public forums, such as chat rooms and bulletin boards. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, phone number), as well as other personal ideas, photographs, writings, music, comments, suggestions and other materials (collectively "User Content"); on the bulletin boards, blogs, or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features. 

Please note that Grey Box does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. Grey Box is not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on through the Services or what others do with information you share with them on the Site. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Services.

Grey Box's websites may contain links to other websites, including without limitation social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. To the extent allowed by law, we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third party websites and we encourage our users to be aware when they leave our websites and to read the privacy statements of any other website that collects personally identifiable information since your rights will be governed by those third party policies.
