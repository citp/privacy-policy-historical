                      Security ("TLS") technology protects customer data using both server authentication and data encryption. These technologies help ensure that customer data is safe, secure and only available to the customer to whom the
                      information belongs and those to whom the customer has granted access. greytHR also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications and the company hosts its websites in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other
                      advanced technology to prevent interference or access from intruders. greytHR also offers enhanced security features within the service that permits customers to configure security settings to the level they deem necessary.</p>
                     <p>Because the company uses the service to maintain data about greytHR customers, this information is secured in the same manner as described above for customer data.</p>
