        <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Through your use of Mobile Apps</b>: When you download and use a Mobile App, we and our service providers may track and collect Mobile App usage data, such as the date and time the Mobile App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the Mobile App based on your device number.

                <b>Through server log files</b>:  An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your device from which you are accessing the Property by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Property, along with the time of the visit and the activity on the Property.

                <b>Receiving marketing-related SMS text messages from us and our affiliates</b>:  If you do not want to receive marketing-related SMS text messages from us and our affiliates on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out from receiving such messages by texting back "STOP" or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@wmg.com">privacypolicy@wmg.com</a>.
