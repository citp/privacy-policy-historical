# Privacy Statement

Idhasoft has created this Privacy Statement to demonstrate its commitment to upholding the privacy of visitors to its Web sites, amongst other contacts.

In this section of the Privacy Statement, Idhasoft describes the type of information it collects and how and why it collects such information.

##### **Registration**

During registration, users are required to provide their contact information (such as name, e-mail id, country), which Idhasoft uses to provide requested services for its Web site visitors, to help make surfing these sites easier, and provide a more personalized experience on these Web sites. Idhasoft uses such information to improve its services, or to market solutions and/or for industry reporting purposes.

##### **Subscription to Newsletters**

Users who wish to subscribe to Idhasoft’s e-mail newsletters are requested to provide their contact information (such as e-mail address, among other details) on the Web site.

##### **Contact Us**

The Web site has features where Idhasoft’s customers and investors can submit information to Idhasoft by using the ‘Contact Us’ facility. Such submissions include queries, feedback, or other information needed to best respond to specific requests. In addition, Idhasoft may retain e-mails and other information sent to it for its internal administrative purposes to help it serve you better.

##### **Automatic data collection**

Idhasoft gathers details such as date, time, browser type, navigation history and IP addresses of all visitors to its web sites. It uses this information for its internal security audit log, analyzing trends, for system administration purposes and, also, to gather visitor behavior and usage patterns on the site. Idhasoft may combine information supplied by an investor/customer during the registration process on the Web site with usage data to learn more about users and their preferences about the content available on the site. Idhasoft may use this information to tailor services to specific interests of visitors, or to contact visitors about offers from its business associates, which may be of interest to them. Idhasoft does not disclose this information to third parties.

##### **Sharing information**

Idhasoft does not sell, rent, or lease its customer and investor information, and registration lists to third parties.

Idhasoft does not share personally identifiable information with third parties apart from parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies. Information may be shared with third parties who are acting as Idhasoft’s agents in providing its product(s)/service(s), and who agree to use it only for that purpose and keep the information secure and confidential.

Idhasoft will also disclose information that it maintains when required to do so by law or, in special cases, when Idhasoft has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or take legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) its rights or property. Idhasoft may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with others.

##### **Safeguarding Security**

Idhasoft will take appropriate steps to ensure that personal data is protected from unauthorized access and disclosure, including limiting access to such data only to those employees with a business need to know.

Users should check this policy frequently to keep abreast of any changes.
