## Privacy Policy

#### General Guidelines for Information Collection and Use:

Gremln collects and compiles statistical information about all visitors to our web site, even if they haven't registered. The information used to compile statistics is passed from a visitor's computer to our server each time a page is requested. This statistical information is logged and provides long-term usage data and trends that help Gremln allocate resources and better meet demands during peak usage. This information is not linked to the end user and is not considered personal information.  
The information collected includes:

1\. The type and version of your Operating System and Web Browser  
2\. Your computer's IP address  
3\. The date and time of your visit  
4\. What page you visited  
5\. What page you came from

When you register with Gremln, you are no longer anonymous. Gremln reserves the right to repost your messages and use them in accordance with the Twitter.com Terms of service agreement. Information Sharing and Disclosure

Other than the following instances, Gremln does not rent, sell or share personal information about you with any other person(s) or organization(s):

* Gremln may share your information with outsourced service providers in order to provide the materials you requested. For example, to fill an order for training materials, your name, address, and phone number may be provided to a third-party order filling agency so they can ship you the materials.  
* When the law requires Gremln to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, Gremln provides the information needed to obey the law. Gremln also may provide information in order to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.  
* Gremln believes it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.  
* Gremln may also share your information with Partner organizations and associations. Because Gremln is in no way responsible for the actions of their Partners, Gremln can not be held liable for their Partners’ use (or misuse) of personal information.

Gremln makes every reasonable effort to ensure the security of the data it collects. However, Gremln cannot warrant against the disclosure of this information in the event of a security breach or other event beyond our control.

Although vulnerabilities in this technology exist, by keeping your web browser up to date, it is unlikely the information in these cookies will be misappropriated.

A cookie is a data file stored on your hard drive by your browser. It does not contain any executable code and cannot gather information from your computer that you have not already provided Gremln either in a form, or by requesting a page from our site (see 'General Guidelines for Information Collection and Use', above).

Gremln reserves the right to send important announcements or notices to all registered users without extending an opportunity to opt-out of such notices.

Gremln reserves the right to maintain archival copies of contact data of our registrants.
