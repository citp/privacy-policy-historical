# Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is a part of the [Terms & Conditions ](http://www.greatplacetowork.com/site-terms-a-conditions)of this website (the “Site”) which are binding on all Site users.

The policy of GREAT PLACE TO WORK INSTITUTE, INC (‘GPTW”) is to respect and protect your privacy. GPTW therefore exercises precautions to maintain the confidentiality of information that you provide to us.

We may gather certain types of personally identifiable information, such as your name, e-mail address, street address or other postal mailing address, and telephone number(s) (collectively, “Personal Information”). It is therefore important for you to know how we collect, use, disclose, manage, and store the Personal Information that you may voluntarily provide to us, as well as the information that is collected passively on the Site.

This Privacy Policy sets forth GPTW’s current policies and practices with respect to Personal Information of Site users .  Your continued participation on this Site indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information as described below.

**If you have any objections to this Privacy Policy, you should immediately discontinue use of the Site.**

###### Collection and Use of Information

We may collect and use aggregate information for analysis and research.  Aggregated information is not covered by this policy because it does not identify any individuals.

You may browse the Site without providing any Personal Information.

We do not collect Personal Information about you except when you provide it, such as when you:

  * click "CONTACT US" on the Site to send us a message
  * place an order
  * download certain articles or reports
  * post a comment on a blog, event or other article
  * sign up to receive e-mails
  * register for a conference or seminar



If you place an order or request certain reports and articles through the Site, you will be asked to submit certain Personal Information, including your full name and address, and in some cases financial information such as your credit card number. This financial information is collected by a third party that is clearly identified. The collection of this financial information is subject to the third party’s privacy policy, so we recommend that you take the time to review that privacy policy.

Additionally, we may post information about career opportunities on the Site. If you are interested in these opportunities, you can submit an application.  We make reasonable efforts to review the applications in a timely fashion.  We will not distribute or share Personal Information submitted in relation to employment with any third party without your consent.

We may also use your Personal Information for operational and business purposes, or to find out how we can improve our organization and Site via surveys or online tracking mechanisms. We use aggregate Personal Information collected directly during any registration process and via “cookies” to help us evaluate and modify existing services and features.

###### Cookies

This Site uses “cookies” to obtain non-Personal Information from online visitors in order to improve their online experience and facilitate their visit within the Site. Cookies are small files stored on a computer hard drive. Websites can use cookies to recognize repeat visitors, and track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements. If a visitor does not want information collected through the use of cookies, most browsers allow the visitor to reject cookies.

###### Disclosure of Information

We may share Personal Information with certain third parties that we engage, and with whom we have written agreements regarding the confidentiality of Personal Information, to help us provide services to you.  Additionally, as GPTW pursues its mission of building  a better society by helping companies transform their workplaces, GPTW may share certain contact information such as your e-mail address with other like-minded organizations; if you do not want GPTW to share your information in this way, you can let us know by using the [“CONTACT US”](http://www.greatplacetowork.com/about-us/contact-us) feature on this Site.  Other than as set forth, we will not sell, exchange, rent, lease or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to any third party without your consent. In particular, we do not share Personal Information with third parties for their marketing or promotional use.

However, GPTW may disclose Personal Information in special cases: (1) when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to investigate, identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be intentionally or unintentionally: (a) causing injury to GPTW or to a third party; (b) interfering with the rights of GPTW or a third party; and/or (c) threatening the physical safety of any person; (2) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, such as to comply with a court order, subpoena or warrant; (3) to our affiliates; and (4) to any third party who may acquire GPTW.

###### Procedures to Review Your Personal Information and to Opt-Out

You can always contact GPTW if you wish to review any Personal Information we may have about you. If we have Personal Information about you, we will provide you with a readable copy of such Personal Information at no charge.  Factual errors in your Personal Information, including out-of-date information, can be corrected by using the [“CONTACT US”](http://www.greatplacetowork.com/about-us/contact-us) feature on this Site to send us a request that credibly shows our error.  To protect your privacy and security, we take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to Personal Information or making corrections.
