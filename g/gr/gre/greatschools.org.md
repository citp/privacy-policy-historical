This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.greatschools.net, a Web site owned and operated by GreatSchools, Inc. If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you should contact our management team by emailing info@greatschools.net. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or feel that your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you can call us at (415) 977-0700. 

Information Collection and Use 

GreatSchools, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways other than as disclosed in this statement. GreatSchools, Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

Cookies 

GreatSchools, Inc. deposits cookies on user's hard drives. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. By setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user may be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

Log Files 

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

Sharing 

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and sponsors. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We may release information a user provides to us, including the user's personal contact information, to any individual claiming that the user falsely impersonated him or her. In addition, we may release a user's personal contact information and other information submitted to us by the user to law enforcement authorities if we suspect that the user has used our web site or services for any unlawful purpose. 

Links 

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that GreatSchools. Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware of when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

Newsletter and My School Stats email updates 

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter or other email services, we may ask for contact information such as name and email address. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level, zip code of residence, and gender) but encouraged so that we can provide more personalized service. 

Optional Surveys & Sweepstakes 

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information may be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

Mail this to a Friend 

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. GreatSchools, Inc. will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. GreatSchools, Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact GreatSchools, Inc. at info@greatschools.net to request the removal of this information from their database. 

Security 

This website takes commercially reasonable precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, GreatSchools, Inc. uses commercially reasonable efforts to protect your information both online and off-line. 

If and when our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information will be encrypted and protected with encryption software called SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link: www.openssl.org. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user-information off-line. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) will be granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. The servers that are used to store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to info@greatschools.net. 

Correction/Updating Personal Information: 

If a user's personally identifiable information changes or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. 

Choice/Opt-out 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications. This can be done at the member information page. 

Notification of Changes 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

Database Security

GreatSchools, Inc. currently keeps all of its data on a secure UNIX server in a password-protected SQL database. We store the passwords in an encrypted password file in this database. This database can only be accessed through a secure shell, not through ftp or telnet. 

Principal Login Security 

When principals choose a password for their Enhanced School Profile, the password is stored on the password protected GreatSchools, Inc.server in a file with MD5 encryption. However, when principals send their password across the Internet to us, there is a very slight possibility that an experienced hacker could steal a principal's password by sniffing the line on the principal's property or somewhere between the principal's property and the GreatSchools, Inc. server. We have not had evidence to date that password information contains a large enough security threat to warrant using a secure shell for this transaction. However, we are still considering the possibility for the future.
