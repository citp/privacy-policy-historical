	<h3 class="section_title2">Privacy &amp; Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
	<p>GreatAuPair has a firm commitment to safeguarding the privacy of our members' Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
	<p>We collect personally identifiable information such as first and last name, birthdate, email address, a home, postal or other physical address 
		or phone number from guests and members during the registration and payment processes and, occasionally, at other times. Information collected by 
		GreatAuPair is securely stored by physical and electronic means. Data collected by GreatAuPair will be shared with third parties only in ways 
		that are described in this privacy policy and will not be sold or rented on an individual basis to independent third parties without your 
		knowledge or permission. By accepting the GreatAuPair Terms of Use, you acknowledge and grant permission to GreatAuPair to use your Personal 
		Contact Information as specifically stated under Uses of Personal Contact Information, herein, on GreatAuPair and its Childcare Network 
		Affiliate websites.</p>
	<p>Search engines may index publicly available information from your profile, such as your first name, that is searchable by anyone on the Internet.
		Search engines do not have access to any Personal Contact Information contained within the fields of a profile, some of which is available only
		to paid members of the GreatAuPair service. Personal Contact Information is defined as first and last name together, email address, phone number
		and physical street address. We also collect your credit card number if you make a purchase. With your permission, we will also supplement data
		through a background check as needed to satisfy U.S. Department of State Au Pair Program Requirements and or for pre-employment screening.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Uses of Personal Contact Information</h3>
	<p>Paid members may see your first and last name listed on your profile. You have the option of providing your phone number, which you may elect 
		to display or not display to paid members; either families or care providers who are claiming to seek a working relationship with you as a 
		result of your online registration. Your email address is not visible to anyone, except to those whom you directly send an email during the 
		time you have a paid subscription. Your physical address is not revealed on the website. A map showing the location of your city or zip code 
		is available and may be seen by registered users. No representations or warranties are made regarding the legitimacy of the claims of those 
		who have paid for a membership subscription to contact you through GreatAuPair's private messaging system which relies on your Personal 
		Contact Information. You are urged to validate the identity of anyone who contacts you and utilize the background check resources available 
		to you through GreatAuPair and the Childcare Network before making any commitments or arrangements. We do not sell, share, rent or trade 
		personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>
	<p>The information you provide during registration may also be used to enable us to process, validate and verify services or membership 
		subscription purchases. We may also provide advertisers with aggregate - never individual - information about our member base and usage 
		patterns. We may also use aggregated information to develop new features and services to better meet member needs.</p>
	<p>Internally we may use aggregated and personally identifiable information to improve our marketing efforts, to statistically analyze site 
		usage, to improve our content and product offerings as well as to customize our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow 
		us to improve our site and better tailor your online experience to meet your needs.</p>
	<p>We also may use personally identifiable information about you to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your 
		interests, such as GreatAuPair news, updates, promotions, Favorites notifications or FastMatch emails. You may opt out of receiving 
		such automated information services at any time by signing in to your account: click My Account then click Preferences in the 
		sub-navigation menu to select your email preferences.</p>
	<p>Users also may post third party personally identifiable information, such as name and email for referral purposes. This information is 
		used only for the purposes which it was collected.</p>
	<p>We use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our <a href="/support.cfm/topic/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
	<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, deactivate or 
		delete it by making your desired changes on your <a href="/myaccount.cfm">My Account</a> page or by contacting our 
		<a href="/support.cfm/topic/help">Customer Support</a> team by email, phone or U.S. mail.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Communications from the Site</h3>
	<p>As part of your registration you are agreeing to receive emails from the site and its members. While you may opt out from receiving certain
		types of emails such as Favorite Notifications or FastMatch emails, you may cease all emails from the site and its members by deactivating
		your profile or canceling your account. To deactivate your profile or cancel your account, sign in and click "My Account" and select your
		desired option under "Account Options". When your account is deactivated or canceled, you will receive an email confirming such action. To 
		remove unauthorized profiles, please send an email to support@greataupair.com.</p>
	<p>We reserve the right to contact any member at any time regarding subscription renewals, profile deactivation, account cancellation and other 
		membership-related problems or questions.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Special Offers and Updates</h3>
	<p>We will occasionally send you information on special services or promotions. You may receive these emails from us as part of your registration.</p>
	<p>Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. At the bottom of every Special Offer email, you will find an "Opt-out" link 
		at the bottom, which if clicked, will remove your name from the list of recipients for future mailings of that type.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Newsletters</h3>
	<p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your 
		privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. At the bottom of every Newsletter, you will find an "Opt-out" link at the bottom, which if 
		clicked, will remove your name from the list of recipients for future Newsletters.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Service-related Announcements</h3>
	<p>We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily 
		suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in 
		nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate or cancel your account.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Legal Disclaimer</h3>
	<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud, or as required by law 
		and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal 
		process served on our website. If GreatAuPair is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will 
		be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, 
		as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.</p>

		identifiable information.</p>

	<p>If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there 
		can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible
		for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. To request removal of your personally identifiable 
		information from our bulletin board or chat room, contact us at support@greataupair.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove
		your personally identifiable information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
	<p>We also have testimonials and reviews on our site, for which users have given permission to have their personally identifiable information 
		posted on this site. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at support@greataupair.com.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Security</h3>
	<p>The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number, 
		drivers license number, national ID number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information 
		using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about how we help protect you and your privacy, visit our 
		<a href="/security_center.htm">Security Center</a>.

	</p><h3 class="section_title2">Tell-A-Friend</h3>
	<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will 
		automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. GreatAuPair does not store and only uses this 
		information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Agents/Service Providers</h3>
	<p>We use third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for services. When you sign up for our service, we will share only 
		that specific personally identifiable information as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are 
		prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Widgets</h3>
	<p>Our website includes Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company 
		(e.g. allowing you to share a profile with your FaceBook or Twitter account). Personally identifiable information, such as your email 
		address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information 
		collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Control of Your Password</h3>
	<p>You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If, despite the foregoing, you lose control 
		of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding
		actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Research</h3>
	<p>We also may conduct occasional online surveys. If you choose to participate, you'll be prompted to answer a series of online questions. Your 
		responses are confidential and will be used for statistical analysis only; no information on an individual's preferences will be shared with 
		any outside organization.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Tracking Technologies</h3>
	<p>Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by GreatAuPair and our marketing and analytics partners. These technologies 
		are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking user's movements around the site and to gather demographic information about 
		our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as 
		aggregated basis.</p>
	<p>We use cookies to help members move faster through our site. When a member signs on to GreatAuPair we may pass a cookie to that user's 
		computer. A cookie is a string of information that's sent by a website and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's 
		memory. This avoids the potentially time-consuming task of entering your user name and password each time a page is requested. Data 
		contained in the cookies is encrypted and is not linked to personally identifiable information. Users can control the use of cookies 
		at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of 
		our site may be limited.</p>

	<h3 class="section_title2">Advertising</h3>
	<p>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party
