# Great Clips, Inc. - Privacy

**Privacy Practices Related to Consumer Data**

At Great Clips Inc. (“Great Clips”), the privacy of our customers is important to us. We collect and use personal information about our customers to create and maintain a relationship that allows us to provide them with quality services and products. We are careful to ensure this information is used responsibly, and only for the purposes for which it was given to us.

**What is Personal Information?**

There are several pieces of personal information that we may collect from our customers. This information is typically collected in the salon during a customer visit; however, it could also be collected over the telephone, through the mail, or over the internet.

The information we may collect includes, but may not be limited to:

  * a customer’s identity or contact information, such as their name, address, and phone number; or, 
  * a customer’s transaction history with Great Clips for products or services they have obtained from us. 



**Why Do We Collect and Use Personal Information?**

We collect basic information about our customers in order to conduct business and provide services to them. We use personal information about our customers for the following purposes:

  * to provide quality, efficient haircuts with personalized service 
  * to remember information about our customers’ last visit, such as technical information related to a particular haircut or products purchased 
  * to learn about who our customers are, how often they visit us, and their expectations pertaining to their services so we can continue to meet their needs 
  * to send or initiate direct mail marketing programs 
  * to be able to contact customers when they have left a personal item in the salon 



Great Clips may provide customer information to a third party vendor for purposes of initiating direct mail marketing programs, or for storage of information for internal reporting purposes only. These vendors have signed confidentiality agreements and are held highly accountable for the protection and proper use of this information.

**What Choices Do You Have?**

By providing information to the staff in the salons, customers are providing their consent for Great Clips to obtain and use their personal information as outlined in this Privacy Practice.

While we work hard to ensure we use and disclose our customers’ personal information only for the purposes identified above, customers can choose to refuse to provide personal information or withdraw their consent at any time, as follows:

  * Customers may have their contact information removed from our marketing lists that are used to inform customers of new or relevant products, services and special offers that may benefit them. 
  * Customers may refuse to provide personal information to us or withdraw their consent at any time. However, in either case this may limit our ability to provide a customer with the highest quality service possible. 



If customers wish to have their name removed from our database, they can use one of the following methods to contact us:

  * Access our website at www.greatclips.com, and select "Company". Click on "Contact Us" to send an e-mail. 
  * Call our corporate offices at 1-800-GREATCLIPS and leave a message with their contact information.
