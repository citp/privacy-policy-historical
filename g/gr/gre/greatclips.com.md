# Privacy Statement

**Privacy Practices Related to Customer Data** , Effective August 2, 2010

At Great Clips, Inc. (“Great Clips” or “we” or “our”), the privacy of our customers is important to us. We collect and use personal information at Great Clips salons and at [www.greatclips.com](http://www.greatclips.com/) (the “Site”) about our customers to create and maintain a relationship that allows us to provide quality services and products. We are careful to ensure this information is used responsibly, and only for the purposes for which it was given to us.

We reserve the right to modify our Privacy Practices from time to time and will mark new versions with a corresponding effective date. We recommend customers visit the Site or any Great Clips salons periodically to review any changes in our practices.

**What Information is Collected?**   
We may collect personal information from customers at Great Clips salons or on the Site. This information is voluntarily provided by the customer and may include information such as a customer’s name, address, telephone number, email address, personal preferences, or other personal identifier. This information may be collected in a Great Clips salon, but can also be collected on this Site for participation in a sweepstakes or other give-away, to locate a salon, to provide “check-in” information electronically through the Salon Locator section, or to otherwise participate in activities or services generated on the Site. The Site may also collect customers’ general information (such as the type of browser used or the files requested) to improve the Site and better meet your needs.

The information we may collect includes, but may not be limited to:

  * A customer’s identity or contact information, such as their name, address, and phone number; 
  * A customer’s transaction history with Great Clips for products or services they have obtained from us; or 
  * Computer data or files, often called “cookies,” which may be sent by a customer’s web browser and stored on an individual computer to allow our server to “recognize” the customer through the navigation of the Site. 
  * Customer’s IP address to measure our website traffic and to help provide more personalized salon information. 



**How is Personal Information Used?  
** We collect basic information about our customers in order to conduct business and provide services to them. We use personal information about our customers for a variety of purposes related to our business, including but not limited to:

• Providing quality, efficient haircuts with personalized service;   
• Tracking information about our customers’ last visit, such as technical information related to a particular haircut or products purchased;   
• Learning about who our customers are, how often they visit us, and their expectations pertaining to their services so we can continue to meet their needs;   
• Sending or initiating direct marketing programs;  
• Contacting customers when they have left a personal item in the salon.

**How is Customer Information Shared and Protected?  
** Great Clips may provide customer information to third service providers or vendors for purposes of, including without limitation, initiating direct marketing programs, data tracking, maintenance or development of the Site, or other contracted promotional opportunities provided to the customer. Great Clips may share this information with any subsidiaries, licensees, affiliates, assigns, successors, or other respective owners. Great Clips may also share your personal information in connection with law enforcement requests or in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

We employ administration, technical and physical safeguards to maintain the confidentiality of customer information.

**How Can Customers Limit Information Collected?**   
By providing information to Great Clips salons or browsing or providing information on the Site, customers are providing their consent for Great Clips to use their personal information as outlined in these Privacy Practices. For more information, please review our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use). 

While we work hard to ensure we use and disclose our customers’ personal information only for the purposes identified above, customers can choose not to provide personal information or limit the personal information obtained by us as follows:

  * Customers may have their contact information removed from our marketing lists that are used to inform customers of new or relevant products, services and special offers that may benefit them; 
  * Customers may refuse to provide personal information to us or withdraw their consent at the time requested or by contacting us as described below. This withdrawal of information may limit our ability to provide a customer with the highest quality service possible.



If customers wish to have their name removed from our database or wish to review any of their information, they can use one of the following methods to contact us:

  * Access our website at [www.greatclips.com](http://www.greatclips.com/), and select “Contact Us” found in the footer to send an e-mail.
