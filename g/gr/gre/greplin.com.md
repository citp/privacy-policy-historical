  2. **Third party authentication** \- When you add a service to Greplin, we use a technology called OAuth to authorize Greplin to access that account. OAuth is a secure protocol that gives us access to your data without actually giving us your password. You can revoke OAuth access either within Greplin or within the third party service.
  3. **Third party data** \- For each of the services you authorize Greplin to access, we create an index of data from that service. This allows us to provide search functionality for your data.
