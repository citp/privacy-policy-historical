Greytip will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as provided in the Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. Individual records of Customer Data may be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issues, or suspected violation of the Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. Customers are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of their Greytip user ids and passwords.

## Public Forums, Refer a Friend, and Customer Testimonials

Greytip may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company's Web sites. Any personally identifiable information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Greytip is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. Customers and Visitors may elect to use the Company's referral service to inform friends about the Company's Web sites.

We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

## Security

When the Service is accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 3.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology protects Customer Data using both server authentication and data encryption. These technologies help ensure that Customer Data is safe, secure, and only available to the Customer to whom the information belongs and those to whom the Customer has granted access. Greytip also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and the Company hosts its Web sites in a secure server environment that uses firewalls and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Greytip also offers enhanced security features within the Service that permit Customers to configure security settings to the level they deem necessary.

Because the Company uses the Service to maintain Data About Greytip Customers, this information is secured in the same manner as described above for Customer Data.
