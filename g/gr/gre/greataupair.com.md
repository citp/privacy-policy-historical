Personal Information  
We at InteliMark Enterprises' GreatAupair have a firm commitment to safeguarding the privacy of our members' data. We collect information from our members during the registration process and, occasionally, at other times. This information collected by GreatAupair is securely stored and will not be sold or rented on an individual basis to any third party without your knowledge or permission. Search engines may index publicly available information from your profile that is searchable by anyone on the Internet. Search engines do not have access to any personal contact information, and such information will not be available to search engines. Contact information is defined as an email address, phone number or address.  
Uses of Registration Information  
Your registration information is made available on the GreatAupair web site to either families or aupairs that are seeking a working relationship with you. The information you provide during registration may also be used to enable us to process, validate and verify paid memberships and to provide advertisers with aggregate - never individual - information about our member base and usage patterns. We may also use aggregated information to develop new features and services to better meet member needs.  
Internally we may use aggregated and personally identifiable information to improve our marketing efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings as well as to customize our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor your online experience to meet your needs.  
We also may use personally identifiable information about you to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as GreatAupair news, updates, promotions, FastMatch or Hot List email notifications. You may opt out of receiving such automated information services at any time by modifying your account preferences.  
We use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Service.  
We reserve the right to contact any member at any time regarding membership renewals or other membership-related problems or questions.  
Control of Your Password  
You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If, despite the foregoing, you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.  
Research  
We also may conduct occasional online surveys. If you choose to participate, you'll be prompted to answer a series of online questions. Your responses are confidential and will be used for statistical analysis only; no information on an individual's preferences will be shared with any outside organization.  
Cookie Technology  
We also employ cookie technology to help members move faster through our site. When a member signs on to GreatAupair we may pass a cookie to that user's computer. A cookie is a string of information that's sent by a web site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. This avoids the potentially time-consuming task of entering your user name and password each time a page is requested.
