Privacy & Personal Information  
InteliMark Enterprises and GreatAupair have a firm commitment to safeguarding the privacy of our members' data. 

We offer this statement to inform our users of how we define, gather and utilize personal information. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to alter this policy at any time. Alterations shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, we may occasionally notify you by email about changes to GreatAupair, its terms or policies or provide notices of changes by displaying notices or links to notices on the web site. Your continued use of GreatAupair following the posting of changes and/or modifications will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms and Privacy Policy. This Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. 

We collect information from guests and members during the registration and payment processes and, occasionally, at other times. Information collected by GreatAupair is securely stored by physical and electronic means. Data collected by GreatAupair will not be sold or rented on an individual basis to independent third parties without your knowledge or permission. By accepting the GreatAupair Terms of Service, you acknowledge and grant permission to GreatAupair to use and sell your Personal Contact Information as specifically stated under Uses of Personal Contact Information, herein. 

Search engines may index publicly available information from your profile that is searchable by anyone on the Internet. Search engines do not have access to any Personal Contact Information contained within the fields of a profile which are available only to paid members of the GreatAupair service. Personal Contact Information is defined as an email address, phone number or physical street address. 

Uses of Personal Contact Information  
The Personal Contact Information you provide in your online profile is made available on GreatAuPair and InteliMark’s Childcare Network Affiliate web sites only to paid members; either families or aupairs/nannies who are claiming to seek a working relationship with you as a result of your online registration. No representations or warranties are made regarding the legitimacy of the claims of those who have paid for membership to access your Personal Contact Information. You are urged to validate the identity of anyone who contacts you and utilize the background check resources available to you through GreatAupair and the Childcare Network before making any commitments or arrangements. 

As a registered guest or paid member of GreatAupair or any Childcare Network Affiliate, you may view, modify or delete your Personal Contact Information at will. 

The information you provide during registration may also be used to enable us to process, validate and verify services or membership purchases. We may also provide advertisers with aggregate - never individual - information about our member base and usage patterns. We may also use aggregated information to develop new features and services to better meet member needs. 

Internally we may use aggregated and personally identifiable information to improve our marketing efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings as well as to customize our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor your online experience to meet your needs. 

We also may use personally identifiable information about you to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as GreatAupair news, updates, promotions, FastMatch or Hot List email notifications. You may opt out of receiving such automated information services at any time by modifying your account preferences. 

We use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Service. 

We reserve the right to contact any member at any time regarding membership renewals or other membership-related problems or questions. 

GreatAupair will disclose your personal contact information to assist law enforcement, prevent fraud and when subpoenaed by law to do so. 

Control of Your Password  
You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If, despite the foregoing, you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. 

Research  
We also may conduct occasional online surveys. If you choose to participate, you'll be prompted to answer a series of online questions. Your responses are confidential and will be used for statistical analysis only; no information on an individual's preferences will be shared with any outside organization. 

Cookie Technology  
We also employ cookie technology to help members move faster through our site. When a member signs on to GreatAupair we may pass a cookie to that user's computer. A cookie is a string of information that's sent by a web site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. This avoids the potentially time-consuming task of entering your user name and password each time a page is requested.
