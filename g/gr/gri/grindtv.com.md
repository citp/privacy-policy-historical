We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with GrindTV.com under confidentiality agreements.

We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of GrindTV.com's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

We transfer information about you if GrindTV.com is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, GrindTV.com will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

GrindTV.com displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, men ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
