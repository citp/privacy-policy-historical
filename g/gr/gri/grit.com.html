Privacy Policy<br>
</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:Arial">Ogden Publications,
Inc. (collectively referred to in this Privacy Statement as "we" or
"Ogden Publications, Inc.") recognize the importance of protecting
the privacy of all information provided by users of our web sites, subscribers
to our magazines, registrants for our events, recipients of our e-mail
newsletters and all of our customers. We created this policy with a fundamental
respect for our users’ right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our
users. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for all products
and services owned by Ogden Publications, Inc.. A current list of our
publications, web sites, and products can be found at <a href="http://www.ogdenpubs.com/">http://www.ogdenpubs.com/</a>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
Ogden Publications, Inc. collects information from our website users,
subscribers and customers. In this section of our privacy policy, we will
describe the type of information we collect and how we use it to provide better
services to our customers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Registration and Ordering</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
When using some of our websites and signing up for certain selected services
(such as archive searches or product ordering), users must first register.
During registration, users are required to give their contact information (such
as name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number). We also may collect
demographic information (such as hobbies, purchasing habits, and areas of
interest ). For internal purposes, we use this information to communicate with
users and provide requested services, and, for our website visitors, to provide
a more personalized experience on our sites. We use aggregate demographic
information about our audience to improve our service, for marketing purposes
and/or industry reporting purposes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Many of our products and services are free to
subscribers who meet certain demographic criteria. Independent auditors may
need to certify the eligibility of these subscribers. In order to do that, we
may collect unique identifiers (such as mother’s maiden name) that we disclose
to the auditors strictly for industry reporting and audit verification
purposes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">For our services that require payment (such
as certain events, products and subscriptions), we also collect credit card information
(such as account name, number and expiration date), which is used for billing
purposes only, and is not otherwise shared. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">E-mail Newsletters</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
If users wish to subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, we ask for contact
information (such as name, e-mail address and, occasionally, demographic
information). We use this information in the same manner as we use contact
information in the registration and ordering process described above.
Recipients of our newsletters can unsubscribe using the instructions listed at
the end of the e-mail newsletter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Surveys and Contests</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
From time to time we invite users to provide information via surveys or
contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary
and the user therefore has a choice whether to disclose requested contact
information (such as name and mailing address) and demographic information
(such as zip code or hobby). In addition to other uses set forth in this
policy, contact information collected in connection with surveys and contests
is used to notify the winners and award prizes, to monitor or improve the use
and satisfaction of the site, and may be shared with sponsors of such surveys
or contests. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Interactive Features</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
At some of our sites, we offer interactive and community features such as
discussion boards. Note that all personal information sent or posted via such
features becomes public information for which we are not responsible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Email This Article</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
If users elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about our
articles, sites and services, we may ask them for the friend's name and e-mail
address. Ogden Publications, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>will
store and use this information to send the friend an invitation. This
information may also be used to provide information about our company and
related products and services. The friend may contact us as specified in the
subsequent message to request that no further communications be sent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Communications with Us</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
We have features where users can submit information to us (such as our feedback
forms). Letters to the editor and similar submissions may be made public.
Requests for service, support or information may be forwarded as needed to best
respond to a specific request. We may retain e-mails and other information sent
to us for our internal administrative purposes, and to help us to serve
customers better. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Communications from Us: Service Updates,
Special Offers</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates that contain
important information about our sites and services. For example, we may send
new members a welcoming message, confirmations on purchases, and verify
password and username for our password-protected sites. We may also communicate
with a user to provide requested services and for account-related issues via
e-mail, phone or regular mail. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">We offer our users the option to receive
information about our company, related products, services and special deals.
Users can choose not to receive these communications, as set forth in our
Permission section below. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Automatic Data Collection</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
Our web sites have features that automatically collect information from users,
to deliver content specific to users' interests and to honor their preferences.
This information assists us in creating sites that will serve the needs of our
users. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">We use "cookies," a piece of data
stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies
benefit the user by requiring login only once, thereby saving time while on our
site. If users reject the cookies, they may be limited in the use of some areas
of our site. For example, the user may not be able to participate in
sweepstakes, contests or drawings. Additionally, we may note some of the pages
the user visits on our site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear
gifs). The use of cookies and pixels enable us to track and target the
interests of our users to enhance the experience on our sites. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Some of our business affiliates use cookies
on our sites in ads or promotions. However, we have no access to or control
over these business affiliates' cookies; we urge users to read their privacy
policies for information. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">For our internal purposes, we gather date,
time, browser type, navigation history and IP address of all visitors to our
site. This information does not contain anything that can identify users
personally. We use this information for our internal security audit log, trend
analysis and system administration, and to gather broad demographic information
about our user base for aggregate use. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">We may combine demographic information
supplied by a subscriber at registration with site usage data to provide
general profiles, in aggregate non-personally identifiable form, about our
users and their preferences in the content of the site and advertising. We may
share this composite information with our advertisers and business affiliates
to help them better understand our services. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">WITH WHOM YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
When we have co-branded, customized, private label, powered by or sponsored
products and services, or when we join with other parties to provide specific
services, we may share (provide and receive) personal information with them. We
do not share credit card information with such third parties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">On occasion, we may provide targeted lists of
names and offline and online? contact information for marketing purposes to
third parties, subject to our Permission policies. We give users the option of
not having their name or contact information disclosed to third parties, as set
forth in the Permission section. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">Other than as set forth above, we do not
share personally identifiable information with other companies, apart from
those acting as our agents in providing our product(s)/service(s), and which
agree to use it only for that purpose and to keep the information secure and
confidential. Also, our parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies, entities
into which our company may be merged, or entities to which any of our assets,
products, sites or operations may be transferred, will be able to use personal
information. We will also disclose information we maintain when required to do
so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena or other
legal obligation, in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or in
special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information
is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may
be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or
unintentionally) our rights or property. Users should also be aware that courts
of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under
certain circumstances to permit personal information to be shared or
transferred to third parties without permission. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">We may share aggregate information, which is
not personally identifiable, with others. This information may include usage
and demographic data, but it will not include personal information. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or
if a user no longer desires our product(s)/service(s), we provide a way to
correct or update that user's personal data. The user should contact Ogden’s
Customer Service Department for the applicable product or service. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">PERMISSION</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt"><br>
Our users are given the opportunity to choose whether to receive information
from our affiliates and us not directly related to the registered services.
Users also have the opportunity to choose whether to have personal information
shared with third parties for marketing purposes. Instructions for how to
exercise this choice are contained in e-mails sent by us, on our product
websites and in each of our publications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Please note that we will endeavor to implement requests within a
reasonable time, although for a time users may continue to receive mailings,
etc., transmitted based on information released prior to the implementation of
the request. Users will continue to receive information directly related to
their registered services, so they always are kept informed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
			<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE:10pt">SECURITY</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE:
10pt"><br>
We use reasonable precautions to protect our users' personal information and to
store it securely. Sensitive information that is transmitted to us online (such
as credit card number) is 128 bit encrypted and is transmitted to us securely.
In addition, access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive
information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who need the
information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a
customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
information. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable
information are kept in a secure environment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
