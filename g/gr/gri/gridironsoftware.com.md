## VI. Our Policies Concerning Children

Our Website is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from such children.

## VIII. Privacy Policies of Linked Sites and Advertisers

Our Website may contain links to third party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites use your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.

## IX. Security of Your Information

FileTrek implements reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline, and we are committed to the protection of customer information.

For user accounts registered directly with FileTrek profile information is protected by the password each member uses to access their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify Us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your FileTrek account, our Website allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology ("SSL").

While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Website and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If you have questions about the security of our Website, please contact us at privacy@filetrek.com.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access.

## X. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you and other users by placing a notice on filetrek.com or by sending you a notice to the email address we have on file for you. You should periodically check www.filetrek.com and this privacy page for updates.
