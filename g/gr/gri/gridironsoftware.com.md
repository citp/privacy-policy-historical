  1. **Information GridIron collects and how GridIron uses it**

GridIron may collect the following types of information: 

    * **Information You provide** — When You sign up for certain GridIron services, GridIron will ask You for [Personal Information](http://www.gridironsoftware.com/key-terms#personalinformation) during the registration process. GridIron may combine this Personal Information, as well as any of [Your Data](http://www.gridironsoftware.com/key-terms#yourdata) which You submit or which is electronically collected, with information from other GridIron products or services You have received, as well as information from third parties, in order to provide You with a better experience and to improve the quality of service provided to You and other users by GridIron.
    * **Cookies** — When You visit the GridIron website, GridIron sends one or more [Cookies](http://www.gridironsoftware.com/key-terms#cookies) to Your computer or other device. GridIron uses Cookies to improve the quality of service provided to You by GridIron, including allowing multiple requests to be made to the GridIron server without needing to re-authenticate You on every access through a GridIron server generated session id. GridIron will not use Cookies to collect Personal Information that You provide to GridIron during the registration process, but the Cookies may be used to collect other information, including Personal Information, such as the following: 
      * the domain name and host from which You accesses the Internet and the Internet address of the website from which You direct-linked to the GridIron site; 
      * the date and time You accessed the GridIron site and the pages You visit; 
      * Your computer's [IP Address](http://www.gridironsoftware.com/key-terms#ipaddress) and information about its operating system, platform and the web browser type and version You use; 
      * demographic and other [Non-Personal Information](http://www.gridironsoftware.com/key-terms#nonpersonalinformation) about You; and 
      * information to combat fraud or misuse.
    * **The[Agent](http://www.gridironsoftware.com/key-terms#agent) and [Metadata](http://www.gridironsoftware.com/key-terms#metadata)** — When You install the Agent on Your computer or other device, the Agent will automatically monitor, record, collect and transmit information, including without limitation Metadata related to Your Data. The Metadata may include Personal Information and Non-Personal Information, such as the means of creation of a [File](http://www.gridironsoftware.com/key-terms#files), purpose of the File, time and date of creation, creator or author of data, placement on a network, access to such File on the network by users, date and time for such access, modifications to such File, and sources of content elements. For a complete list of the all Metadata currently being captures and stored by GridIron, please see the [MetaData Captured](http://www.gridironsoftware.com/metadata-captured) portion of the GridIron web site. GridIron uses Your Metadata (a) solely in connection with GridIron's operation of the GridIron Service, including without limitation potentially disclosing Your Metadata to third parties and other GridIron customers in the course of GridIron's operation of the GridIron Service and (b) without limitation in any manner GridIron determines appropriate provided that Your Data and the MetaData is aggregated with other data and no longer contains any Personal Information.
    * **User communications** — When You send email or other communications to GridIron, GridIron may retain those communications in order to process Your inquiries, respond to Your requests and improve GridIron's services. GridIron may use Your email address to communicate with You about GridIron's services.
    * **Other sites** — The GridIron site contains links to other sites. GridIron is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. GridIron encourages You to be aware when leaving the GridIron site and to read the privacy statements of every website that collects Your personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by GridIron.

In addition to the above, GridIron may use the information it collects to: 

    * Provide, maintain, protect, and improve Gridiron's services and develop new services; and 
    * Protect the rights or property of GridIron or its users.
  2. **Choices**

You can review and control certain information stored in Your GridIron account using the Account Overview and Edit Account functions.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies, but You can reset Your browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent. However, some GridIron features and services may not function properly if Your Cookies are disabled. 

You understand and agree that once You install the Agent, the Agent shall continue to monitor, record, collect and transmit Your Metadata until You uninstall the Agent or otherwise render it inoperable. This includes even after You stop receiving GridIron services. If You are receiving GridIron Services, You will be provided with an option (through Your user account) to render the Agent inoperable at the time that your Subscription Agreement expires or is terminated. If You disable the Agent while still receiving GridIron Services, the GridIron Services may not function properly. 

  3. **Information sharing**

GridIron only shares information with other companies or individuals outside of GridIron in the following limited circumstances:

    * GridIron has Your consent. GridIron requires opt-in consent for the sharing of any [Sensitive Information](http://www.gridironsoftware.com/key-terms#sensitiveinformation). 
    * GridIron provides information to its subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of providing services to or on GridIron's behalf. GridIron requires that these parties agree to process such information based on GridIron's instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. Examples include providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, sending emails to You, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing You the option of sharing information about GridIron on social networks.
    * GridIron has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Subscription Agreements, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of GridIron, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
    * GridIron shares Non-Personal Information with advertisers, service providers, and other persons with whom it conducts business. Similarly, these advertisers, service providers, and other persons may share with GridIron Non-Personal Information about You that they have independently gathered or acquired.

If GridIron becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, information may be shared. GridIron will ensure the confidentiality of any Personal Information involved in such transactions and provide notice before Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Also, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, information may be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession and then to a subsequent purchaser.

  4. **Information security and retention**

GridIron takes appropriate, commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of Your Data and Metadata. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where GridIron stores personal data. 

GridIron restricts access to Your Data to GridIron employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on GridIron's behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. 

However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes, or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while GridIron uses commercially reasonable efforts to protect Your Data and Metadata, GridIron cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect Your Data and Metadata, You agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure GridIron's compliance with that duty.

GridIron retains information for as long as required, allowed or GridIron believes it is useful, but does not undertake retention obligations. GridIron may dispose of information in GridIron's sole discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of information. You must keep Your own, separate back-up records of Your Data. Your Data will be permanently deleted by GridIron thirty days after Your Subscription Agreement is terminated or expired. Metadata may be stored and maintained by GridIron indefinitely for use with providing GridIron services to third parties.

  5. **Accessing and updating information**

When You use GridIron services, GridIron makes good faith efforts to provide You with access to Your information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at Your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. GridIron asks individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where GridIron provides information access and correction, GridIron performs this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way GridIron maintain certain services, after You delete Your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from GridIron's active servers and may remain in backup systems. 

  6. **Enforcement**

GridIron regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When it receives formal written complaints, it is GridIron's practice to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. GridIron will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between GridIron and an individual. 

  7. **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. GridIron will not reduce Your rights under this Privacy Policy without Your explicit consent. GridIron will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). GridIron will also keep [prior versions](http://www.gridironsoftware.com/privacy) of this Privacy Policy in an archive for Your review.
