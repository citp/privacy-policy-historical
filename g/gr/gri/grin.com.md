### Cookies and right to object in direct mail

"Cookies" are small files that are stored on users' computers. Different information can be stored within the cookies. A cookie is primarily used to store the information about a user (or the device on which the cookie is stored) during or after his visit to an online offer. Temporary cookies, or "session cookies" or "transient cookies", are cookies that are deleted after a user leaves an online service and closes his browser. In such a cookie, e.g. the contents of a shopping cart are stored in an online store or a login jam. The term "permanent" or "persistent" refers to cookies that remain stored even after the browser has been closed. Thus, e.g. the login status will be saved if users visit it after several days. Likewise, in such a cookie the interests of the users can be stored, which are used for range measurement or marketing purposes. A "third-party cookie" refers to cookies that are offered by providers other than the person who manages the online offer (otherwise, if it is only their cookies, this is called "first-party cookies").

We can use temporary and permanent cookies and clarify this in the context of this privacy policy.

We strive to provide you with the most personalized and user-friendly service possible. For this, and in order to make website improvements, we collect and store information about how you use our offer. We use cookies, small text files that your browser stores on your computer or mobile phone.

A cookie itself does not contain or collect any personal information about you or your internet usage. However, they are important, for example, for analyzing the behavior of guests on our website, or for showing personalized offers or for registering registered users for the duration of their visit. Cookies allow the website to "remember" you either for the duration of your current visit ("session cookie") or for multiple visits ("persistent cookie"). First and foremost, they should allow you to use our website more efficiently and activate certain functions on the website.

**How can you control the receipt of cookies?**

Most web browsers accept cookies automatically. You can prevent cookies from being stored on your computer or mobile phone by setting your browser to not accept cookies. For detailed instructions on how to change your cookie settings, see the "Help" section of your browser. You can also at any time delete the cookies that are already stored on your device. Helpful information can be found on the information page allaboutcookies.org.

If you decide to generally not accept cookies, you can of course visit our website anyway. However, it may happen that you will not be able to use all the features and services or that certain content we offer you will be unavailable.

A general contradiction against the use of the cookies used for the purpose of online marketing can in a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, on the US side [www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or the EU page [www.youronlinechoices.com/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) be explained.

However, the shipping service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address them themselves or to pass the data on to third parties

**Newsletter - Success Measurement**

The newsletters contain a so-called "web-beacon", ie. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the server when opening the newsletter from our server, or if we use a shipping service provider whose server is called. This call will initially collect technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval.

This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times. Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters will be opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our goal nor, if used, that of the shipping service provider to observe individual users. The evaluations rather serve us to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.

### Google Analytics

Based on our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. GDPR), Google Analytics uses a web analytics service provided by Google LLC ("Google"). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offer by the users are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. To learn more about how Google uses data when using partners' websites and apps, visit: <https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en>.

Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with further services related to the use of this online offer and the internet usage. In this case, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.

Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation: [https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active) .

We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the users will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.

For more information about Google's data usage, hiring and disparaging options, please read Google's Privacy Policy (<https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads>) and the settings for the display of advertising by Google ( <https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated> ).

The personal data of users will be deleted or anonymized after 14 months.

### Google Re / marketing services

On the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. GDPR) we use the marketing and remarketing services ("Google Marketing Services "), LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, ("Google").

Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation ([https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active)).

Google Marketing Services allows us to better target advertisements for and on our website so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests. If a user e.g. is being shown ads for products he's been interested in on other websites, this is called remarketing. For these purposes, when Google and our other websites accessing Google Marketing Services are directly accessed by Google, a code will be executed by Google and so-called (re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also called "Web Beacons ") are being incorporated into the website. With their help, the user is provided with an individual cookie, ie. a small file is saved (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used). The cookies can be set by different domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. In this file is noted which web pages the user visited, in what content he is interested and what offers he has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visiting time and other information on the use of the online offer. The IP address of the users is also recorded, whereby in the context of Google Analytics we announce that the IP address is shortened within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and is only in exceptional cases being transmitted to one Google server in the US and shortened there. The IP address will not be merged with data of the user within other offers from Google. The above information may also be linked by Google with such information from other sources. If the user then visits other websites, ads tailored to him can be displayed according to his interests.

The data of the users are pseudonymously processed in the context of the Google marketing services. Ie. Google stores and processes e.g. not the name or e-mail address of the users, but processes the relevant data cookie-related within pseudonymous user profiles. Ie. from the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is. This does not apply if a user has explicitly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about users through Google Marketing Services is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States.

Among the Google marketing services we use is amongst others the online advertising program "Google AdWords". In the case of Google AdWords, each advertiser receives a different "conversion cookie". Cookies cannot be tracked through AdWords advertisers' websites. The information collected through the cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Advertisers will see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, they do not receive information that personally identifies users.

We can incorporate third-party ads based on the Google AdSense marketing service. AdSense uses cookies that enable Google and its affiliate sites to serve ads based on users' visits to this site or other sites on the Internet.

In addition, we may use the "Google Tag Manager" to integrate and manage the Google Analytics and Marketing Services on our website.

For more information about Google's data usage for marketing, see the overview page: <https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads> , Google's Privacy Policy is available at <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy> abrufbar.

If you wish to object the interest-based advertising through Google Marketing Services, you can take advantage of Google's setting and opt-out options: <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences>.

### Facebook-Pixels, Custom Audiences and Facebook Conversion

Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation ([https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active)).

With the help of the Facebook pixel, it is on the one hand possible for Facebook to determine the visitors to our online offer as a target group for the display of advertisements (so-called "Facebook ads"). Accordingly, we use the Facebook Pixel to display the Facebook Ads we operate only to those Facebook users who have shown an interest in our online offer or who show certain features (eg interests in certain topics or products which are determined) Web pages determined on the basis of visited websites), which we transmit to Facebook (so-called "Custom Audiences"). With the help of the Facebook pixel, we also want to make sure that our Facebook ads are in line with the potential interest of users and are not annoying. With the help of the Facebook pixel we can also understand the effectiveness of the Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes, in which we see whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called "conversion").

The processing of the data by Facebook is part of Facebook's data usage policy. Accordingly, general notes on how to display Facebook Ads, in Facebook's Data Usage Policy: <https://www.facebook.com/policy.php>. For specific information and details about the Facebook Pixel and how it works, visit the help section of Facebook: <https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616>.

You may object to the capture by the Facebook Pixel and use of your data to display Facebook Ads. To set which types of ads you see within Facebook, you can go to the page set up by Facebook and follow the instructions for the usage-based advertising settings: <https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads>. The settings are platform independent, ie. they are adopted for all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.

You can also use the Cookies for distance measurement and promotional purposes via the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative (<http://optout.networkadvertising.org/>) and in addition the US website (<http://www.aboutads.info/choices>) or the European website (<http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices/>) widersprechen.

### Integration of services and contents of third parties

Based on our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. GDPR), we make use of content or services offered by third-party providers in order to provide their content and services, such as Include videos or fonts (collectively referred to as "content").

This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content. We endeavor to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also referred to as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include, but is not limited to, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visit time, and other information regarding the use of our online offer.

### Youtube

We embed the videos on the YouTube platform of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Privacy Policy: <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/>, Opt-Out: <https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated>.

We use the so-called "extended privacy mode" of the provider Youtube to embed videos. At the same time, a cookie is only saved on your computer when the video is played. According to Youtube, however, no personal cookie information is stored for playing embedded videos with enhanced privacy. For more information about YouTube's official privacy policy, please visit: <http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_at_youtube>

### Use of Facebook social plugins

Based on our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) f. GDPR) we use social plugins ("plugins") of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbor, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook"). The plugins can represent interaction elements or content (eg videos, graphics or text contributions) and can be recognized by one of the Facebook logos (white "f" on blue tile, the terms "Like", "Like" or a "thumbs up" sign ) or are marked with the addition "Facebook Social Plugin". The list and appearance of Facebook Social Plugins can be viewed here: <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/>.

Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation ([https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active).

When a user invokes a feature of this online offering that includes such a plugin, their device establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to the device of the user and incorporated by him into the online offer. In the process, user profiles can be created from the processed data. We therefore have no influence on the amount of data that Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore informs the users according to our knowledge.

By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the online offer. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to his Facebook account. If users interact with the plugins, for example press the Like button or leave a comment, the information is transmitted from your device directly to Facebook and stored there. If a user is not a member of Facebook, there is still the possibility that Facebook will find out and save their IP address. According to Facebook, only an anonymous IP address is stored in Germany.

The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the related rights and setting options for protecting the privacy of users, can be found in Facebook's privacy policy: <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/> .

If a user is a Facebook member and does not want Facebook to collect data about him via this online offer and link it to his member data stored on Facebook, he must log out of Facebook and delete his cookies before using our online offer. Other settings and inconsistencies regarding the use of data for advertising purposes are possible within the Facebook profile settings: <https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads> or via the US-American site <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> or the EU page <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/>. The settings are platform independent, ie. they are adopted for all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.
