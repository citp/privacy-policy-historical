# Grizzly.com® -- Customer Privacy Policy

PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT

**Grizzly Industrial Inc. Privacy Notice**

Last updated October 17th, 2016.

This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Grizzly.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

**What Personal Information About Customers Does Grizzly.com Gather?**

  * **Information You Give Us** : We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.

  * **Automatic Information** : We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use “cookies,” and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Grizzly.com

  * **E-mail Communication** : To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Grizzly.com if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please [_unsubscribe from our list_](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe).




**What About Cookies?**

  * Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features such as the storage of items in your shopping cart between visits.

  * The Help features on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Grizzly.com’s essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Grizzly.com products and services that require you to Sign In.




**Does Grizzly.com Share the Information It Receives?**

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries Grizzly.com controls that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

  * **Third-Party Service Providers** : We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering packages, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

  * **Business Transfers** : As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Grizzly.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

  * **Protection of Grizzly.com and Others** : We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our [_Conditions of Use_](https://web.archive.org/conditions-of-use) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Grizzly.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.




**How Secure Is Information About Me?**

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

  * We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming and order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.




**Which Information Can I Access?**

Grizzly.com gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with Grizzly.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. 

**What Choices Do I Have?**

  * As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such Grizzly.com features as Your Profile, Wish List, or Customer Reviews.

  * You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the Which Information Can I Access? Section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.




**Are Children Allowed to Use Grizzly.com?**

Grizzly.com does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell some children’s products for purchase by adults. If you are under 13, you may not have an account or purchase products from us.

Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions

If you choose to visit Grizzly.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our [_Conditions of Use_](https://web.archive.org/conditions-of-use) , including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Washington. If you have any concern about privacy at Grizzly.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the [_Conditions of Use_](https://web.archive.org/conditions-of-use) will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
