# Privacy Policy

###### Effective Date: September 14, 2017

### Introduction

The website [www.grc.org](http://www.grc.org/) and any other website or application on which we have posted a link to this page (the “Website”) is owned and operated by Gordon Research Conferences (“GRC,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy applies to our collection, storage, use and dissemination of information gathered from online visitors to the Website. By visiting the Website, you agree that your visit and any dispute over our online privacy practices is governed by this Privacy Policy and our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/). 

BY PROVIDING INFORMATION TO GRC VIA THIS WEBSITE, YOU ARE DEEMED TO CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, STORAGE, USE AND DISSEMINATION OF SUCH INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

### Information Collected by GRC and How it is Regularly Used and Shared

  1. **Why, When and What Personally Identifiable Information is Collected**

GRC collects information that individual visitors provide voluntarily. Some of this information is collected because it is useful in connection with GRC’s objectives, which include: 1. organizing scientific conferences;  
2. providing an application and registration process for attendance at GRC conferences;  
3. providing a forum for career networking and career advancement; and  
4. supporting and encouraging young scientists as they establish initial scientific and personal contacts.   
(For more information, feel free to read the [GRC Mission Statement](https://web.archive.org/about/).)

In connection with your use of the Website, GRC may collect and store “Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”. Pll is information that can be used to identify you specifically, such as your name, employer, physical address, email address, telephone number, fax number, picture, and education and work history. GRC does not store credit card data, it is processed by Payeezy.  [Click here to read their privacy policy](https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/privacy.html).  

     GRC may collect and store PII in various places throughout the Website, including in connection with an application to attend a conference, or your services on a GRC board or committee (e.g., the Board of Trustees, the Finance Committee, the Conference Evaluation Committee), each as described in further detail below. Pll may also be collected and stored if you provide it elsewhere in the course of a visit to the Website, such as while making a contribution to GRC, or in connection with a request for information from GRC.  
In addition to the uses described below, we may use your Pll to:

1. notify you of upcoming conferences, meetings and other events;  
2. contact you to respond to your questions and requests for information; and  
3. provide you with other information that we believe may be of interest to visitors to our website.  
       

  i. **Conference Application and Admission Processes**

If you apply to attend a conference, we will collect PII to facilitate that process. Such information may include your contact details, such as your name, employer, physical address, email address, telephone number and fax number. This is so that we can contact you and process your application. In addition, the Pll requested may include your educational background and work history (including degrees received, positions held, awards and honors received) and publications in the relevant field. This is so that you can be considered for admission to the conference.

If your conference application is approved, you are expected to register and pay immediately to confirm your attendance and accommodations. To facilitate payment, GRC uses a third-party payment processor who collects your payment and billing information — e.g., your credit card number and billing address — who will use such information to process your payments.   
If you are accepted to a conference, we will use your Pll to:

1\. process your registration and facilitate your attendance at the conferences;  
2. process your payments related to conference attendance as aforesaid;  
3. provide you with information regarding the conference, including scheduling and logistics; and  
4. provide you with other information that we believe may be of interest to conference attendees.

We also may share Pll (other than payment information) of conference attendees with the other persons attending the same conference. The purpose of this is to enable conference attendees to contact each other prior to and after the conference, for networking purposes, in furtherance of one aspect of the GRC's mission.       

  ii.   **Service on a GRC Board or Committee, or as a Speaker**

If you agree to serve on a GRC Board or Committee, to Chair, Vice Chair or speak at a GRC conference, PII we collect may include your name, employer, physical address, email address, telephone number and fax number. We also usually request more detailed information regarding your educational and professional background, and we may also request a photograph.

We collect this information to make it available to conference applicants and attendees, and to those interested in learning more about GRC and the conferences it organizes.

Accordingly, if you agree to serve on a GRC Board or Committee, to chair, vice chair or speak at a GRC conference, we may post your PII on the relevant page of the Website, such as your name, employer, physical address, email address, telephone number and fax number, and your photograph if you have provided one. This is so that visitors to the Website, including conference applicants, attendees and speakers, and those interested generally in the GRC, can contact you with questions and requests for more information, and to provide feedback.       

  2. **Why, When and What Usage Data is Collected**

In addition to the information that users of the Website provide voluntarily, GRC may automatically collect certain information when you visit or use our Website. This information may include your IP address (or other unique device identifier, including one that we may assign); certain details about your browser, operating system, and hardware; your location, if available; the URL that referred you to the Website; your activities on the Website, including your preferences; and other logging information, such as the date and time of your visit. We may use a variety of tracking technologies to automatically collect information, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, browser fingerprinting, GPS, iBeacons, and ETags (or “entity tags”). 

    i.    **Cookies**

“Cookie” technology helps GRC to simplify visitors' interactions with the Website. A cookie is a very small amount of information that is placed on your computer's hard drive by your browser on GRC's behalf. It is sent by your browser back to GRC when your return to the Website.

You may always choose not to receive a cookie by enabling your web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before your browser accepts a cookie. By refusing to accept a cookie, you may be asked to enter certain information each time you access certain areas of the Website. In addition, for marketing purposes, we may review specific paths that you or an aggregate of customers have traveled through the Website.

All web servers log certain technical information from visitors each time they request a page. We may aggregate such logged information anonymously to assist in designing enhanced user experiences and easier access to our information and services.

  3. **Third-Party Tracking and Do Not Track**

Third parties may use tracking technologies in connection with our Website, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these third-party technologies because we may not control them and we are not responsible for them. Do Not Track is a technology that enables users to opt out of tracking by websites they do not visit. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to Do Not Track technology.                




### Additional Ways Your PII may be Used and Shared

  1. **Use and Sharing Required by Law, to Prevent Harm and/or in Investigations**

In addition to the uses and dissemination of Pll described above, GRC may disclose your PII, the contents of your communications with us, and/or other information you have provided to us if required to do so by law, or with your consent, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary: (1) to conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on GRC; (2) to protect or defend the rights or property of GRC or others; (3) to assist, under exigent circumstances, in the investigation of possible violations of law or other investigations; and/or (4) to assist law enforcement in preventing harm to anyone.

  2. **Sale of PII**

GRC does not sell or rent visitors' Pll to anyone, with the following possible exception: GRC may provide visitors' Pll to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (“AAAS”) to assist the AAAS in its mission. The AAAS is an international non-profit organization whose mission is to “advance science and innovation throughout the world for the benefit of all people.” To fulfill this mission, the AAAS seeks, among other things, to:

A. Foster communication among scientists, engineers and the public;  
B. Enhance international cooperation in science and its applications; and  
C. Foster education in science and technology for everyone.  
(The executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, or such officer's delegate, serves as a Trustee of GRC.)
