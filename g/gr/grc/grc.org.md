### Information Collected by GRC and How it is Regularly Used and Shared

##### A. Why, When and What Personally Identifiable Information is Collected, Legal Basis

GRC collects information that individual visitors provide voluntarily. Some of this information is collected because it is useful in connection with GRC’s objectives, which include:

1\. organizing scientific conferences;  
2\. providing an application and registration process for attendance at GRC conferences;  
3\. providing a forum for career networking and career advancement; and  
4\. supporting and encouraging young scientists as they establish initial scientific and personal contacts.

(For more information, feel free to read the [GRC Mission Statement](https://www.grc.org/about/).)

 **If you are an EU Individual, these are the purposes for which we process your PII.**

The PII which GRC collects and uses for these purposes typically includes your name, employer, physical address, email address, telephone number, fax number, picture, and education and work history. GRC does not store credit card data, it is processed by Payeezy, a First Data product. [Click here](https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/privacy.html) to read their privacy policy.

GRC may collect and store PII in various places throughout the Website, including in connection with an application to attend a conference, or your services on a GRC board or committee (e.g., the Board of Trustees, the Finance Committee, the Conference Evaluation Committee), each as described in further detail below. PII may also be collected and stored if you provide it elsewhere in the course of a visit to the Website, such as while making a contribution to GRC, or in connection with a request for information from GRC.In addition to the uses described above, we may use your PII to:

  1. notify you of upcoming conferences, meetings and other events;
  2. contact you to respond to your questions and requests for information; and
  3. provide you with other information that we believe may be of interest to visitors to our website.



##### i. Conference Application and Admission Processes

If you apply to attend a conference, we will collect PII to facilitate that process. Such information may include your contact details, such as your name, employer, physical address, email address, telephone number and fax number. This is so that we can contact you and process your application. In addition, the PII requested may include your educational background and work history (including degrees received, positions held, awards and honors received) and publications in the relevant field. This is so that you can be considered for admission to the conference.

If your conference application is approved, you are expected to register and pay immediately to confirm your attendance and accommodations. To facilitate payment, GRC uses a third-party payment processor who collects your payment and billing information — e.g., your credit card number and billing address — who will use such information to process your payments. 

If you are accepted to a conference, we will use your PII to:

1\. process your registration and facilitate your attendance at the conferences;  
2\. process your payments related to conference attendance as aforesaid;  
3\. provide you with information regarding the conference, including scheduling and logistics; and  
4\. provide you with other information that we believe may be of interest to conference attendees.

With your consent, we also may share PII (other than payment information) of conference attendees with the other persons attending the same conference. The purpose of this is to enable conference attendees to contact each other prior to and after the conference, for networking purposes, in furtherance of one aspect of the GRC's mission.

##### ii. Service on a GRC Board or Committee, or as a Speaker

If you agree to serve on a GRC board or committee, to chair, vice chair or speak at a GRC conference, whether from the podium, as a poster presenter or otherwise, PII we collect may include your name, employer, physical address, email address, telephone number and fax number. We also usually request more detailed information regarding your educational and professional background, and we may also request a photograph.

We collect this information to make it available to conference applicants and attendees, and to those interested in learning more about GRC and the conferences it organizes.

Accordingly, if you agree to serve on a GRC board or committee, to chair, vice chair or speak at a GRC conference, whether from the podium, as a poster presenter or otherwise, we may post your PII on the relevant page of the Website, such as your name, employer, physical address, email address, telephone number and fax number, and your photograph if you have provided one. This is so that visitors to the Website, including conference applicants, attendees and speakers, and those interested generally in the GRC, can contact you with questions and requests for more information, and to provide feedback.
