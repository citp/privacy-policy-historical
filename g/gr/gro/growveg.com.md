# GrowVeg.com - Privacy Policy

The GrowVeg.com website, Garden Planner and GrowingInteractive.com website are run by the company [Growing Interactive Ltd](http://www.growinginteractive.com/), based in the UK and covered by UK Data Protection law.

## Security

Growing Interactive Ltd takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Garden Planner or our website, their information is protected both online and offline. Sensitive information such as credit card details are not stored on our own servers but passed directly to our secure payment provider. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment. 

## Third Party Access to Personal Information

Growing Interactive Ltd does not pass user-related data to any third party except where necessary for the fulfilment of our business obligations and only where an equally strict privacy policy is in effect. For example we pass credit card information necessary for the fulfilment of subscriptions through to our secure payment provider (e.g. PayPal) in order for them to process the money transfer.

The only exception to this is when we have partnered with another company to provide branded Garden Planner software for them. In such cases you may be given the option to have your email address passed on to the partner company so that they may send you gardening information or relevant offers. If you choose to have your email address passed on then it will be subject to the privacy policy, procedures and unsubscribe system of the partner company and you agree that we are not responsible for such use.

## Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy and keep your data from being passed on to other third parties, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our company or website. 

## Log Files

Like most standard website servers we use log files. This may include any or all of the following: internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyse trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

## Links

The Garden Planner, GrowVeg.com website and GrowingInteractive.com website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Growing Interactive Ltd, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by our Garden Planner software, GrowVeg.com website and GrowingInteractive.com website.

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement on our site and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected (which may differ if you sign up for our service on another website). 

## Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe from our emails and service you can use the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email our system sends out. Alternatively you may use any of the following:
