You can contact us through the Contact page on any of our websites or within our apps or services.

We intend only to process personal information fairly and transparently as required by data protection law including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

In that case, it's unlikely we'll hold and process any information relating to you.

We'll endeavour to remind you of your right to opt-out on each occasion that we provide such information.

At the point of collecting information, we'll endeavour to explain how we intend to use the information.
