# Privacy Policy – Group Support

At Group Publishing our goal is to be the first source that you turn to for tips and resources to help you maximize the effectiveness of your ministry. Group Publishing respects your privacy and holds it as a priority. Our privacy policy is intended to keep you informed about the information we collect about you, when and with whom we share your information, and to give you a choice in how we use and disclose your information.

This privacy policy addresses all information received by any Web site that is hosted by Group Publishing ("Group Publishing Web sites") as well as information that you share with us over the telephone.

## The Information We Collect

When you participate in activities on Group Publishing's Web sites, you provide certain personally identifiable information (PII). Examples of this information may be any of the following: your name, email address, church or organization affiliation, personal or church address, personal or church phone number, credit card information, personal and/or church demographic information, personal shopping, contact preferences, and personal and/or professional opinions.

## How We Use Your Personal Information

We use your personal information to complete the transaction (including order confirmation and appropriate follow up) and/or other interaction that you initiated and to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Group Publishing Web sites. We may also use the information you have provided to send you mail or e-mail, or to call you, about new products, services, events, membership benefits or important information relating to Group or to contact you on behalf of selected ministry partners we work with.

## How We Share Your Information

Group Publishing does not share, sell, rent, loan, or give your personal information to any other companies or third parties except when you purchase a book or magazine subscription. In these instances, we may, at times, share only your postal contact information (name, title, church name, and postal address) with select third parties that offer products, services or events that we feel may benefit you and your ministry (such as catalog publishers, other book and magazine publishers, charitable organizations, or other church or general use resource providers). Group Publishing may share your personal information with Group Workcamps Foundation.

When you submit content to a Group Publishing Web site (such as the Rough Edit Web site) or any other personal information you voluntarily disclose online (in discussion boards, messages, chat areas, etc.), it becomes available to the public and may be collected and used by others. When you upload content or send messages through Group Publishing Web sites, your account name (not your e-mail address) is displayed to other users, and other users can contact you through your content, messages, and comments. The content that you submit to the Group Publishing Web sites may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.

## How to "Opt Out" of Group Communications

If you prefer that we not (a) contact you about new products, services, events, membership benefits or important information relating to Group or a selected ministry partners we work with, or (b) share your postal contact information with select catalog publishers, other book and magazine publishers, charitable organizations, or other church and/or general use resource providers, you can "opt out." To do so, please e-mail your request to [**marketing-reply  
@group.com**](mailto:marketing-reply@group.com). Be sure to include your name, church name, and address so the appropriate changes are made to your account and/or record. Or you can call one of our customer representatives at **1-800-447-1070**.

When you subscribe to our online newsletters there are instructions at the bottom of your e-mail newsletter telling you how to unsubscribe if you ever wish to do so.

## Cookies

We use cookies on our Web sites to help you in your online shopping at www.group.com, and to help tailor your experience at our Web sites. Cookies are little bits of electronic information that a Web site can store on your computer to help make shopping online easier and to help personalize your visit to Group Publishing Web sites. You can choose not to accept the cookies through the privacy setting on your browser. However, you may be unable to shop online, or you may find you need to re-enter information to download free samples of our resources.

As is true of most web sites, we automatically gather certain information about visits to the Group Publishing Web site and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and click stream data. This information is not connected to individual names or personal identities. We aggregate this information and use it to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

## Security

Group Publishing uses commercially reasonable physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to help protect against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration or destruction of any content or information you may have provided at our sites. We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving user data exchanged with our sites.

When you shop online at www.group.com, we use SSL (secure socket layers) to encrypt all information that you share with us, including your credit card number. Only www.group.com has the key needed to decode your information. You can tell if the page you are on is using SSL technology by looking at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock, SSL is engaged and your information is secure. You also can look at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure page, the characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." When you send us e-mail over the Internet, the transmission is not protected from interception.

Once we receive your transmission of information, Group Publishing uses commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the systems where your information is stored by, for example, storing information on our secure servers. In addition, only select employees are authorized to access your information and to maintain the database that stores your information.

Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to Group Publishing or that we store at Group Publishing. If, for any reason you are unable to connect to our server or would rather place your order by phone, please call us at 1-800-447-1070.

## When Group Publishing Discloses Information

Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Group Publishing will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to comply with any applicable laws or to respond to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process received by Group Publishing; (2) to protect the safety of members of the public or users of Group Publishing's Web sites; or (3) to enforce our Terms of Use or to protect our rights or property.

## Contests

Group Publishing occasionally offers contests. The full rules for our contests are clearly posted during each contest. The information that is gathered through a contest is used only by Group Publishing to verify user identity and to contact winners and/or prize recipients.

## Links to Other Sites

Independent organizations that are not related to Group Publishing may operate online areas that you may visit via links from our Web sites. Group Publishing does not have any control over these Web sites or their privacy practices. You need to read the respective privacy policies of these third-party organizations for information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Group Publishing's privacy policy does not apply to the activities of third-party Web sites.

Group Publishing does not knowingly collect information about children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Group Publishing Web sites at any time or in any manner. If we learn that content or personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been submitted and collected on the Group Publishing Web sites, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

## In the Event of a Merger or Sale

In the event that Group Publishing is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, the information Group Publishing collects may be one of the assets examined or transferred as part of the transaction. Group Publishing will not permit another business to examine the information Group Publishing has collected without a confidentiality agreement. In the event a transaction is completed, Group Publishing reserves the right, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. Group Publishing will not transfer the information it has collected unless the recipient agrees to provide privacy protections equal to or exceeding those established by this Privacy Policy. In the unlikely event that Group Publishing is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, Group Publishing may sell your information to the extent permitted by applicable law.

## Updates to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy notice periodically. Please check this page for changes. We will notify you by placing a notice on our Web sites if we make any changes in the way we treat personally identifiable information. If we revise this Privacy Policy, we will not use or share your information in a manner that is incompatible with the policy in effect when your information was initially collected.
