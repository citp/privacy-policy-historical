# Privacy Policy | GroupM

Last updated, June 30, 2014

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to provide clear notice about how GroupM Worldwide Inc., (“GroupM”) collects information from you and how we use it in connection with our Services and on [http://www.GroupM.com](http://www.groupm.com/), (“Site”). GroupM is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users and fostering user confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing.  Accordingly, we are committed to observing applicable industry guidelines including those established and put forward by the DAA which is an alliance of industry groups including the Interactive Advertising Bureau, American Association of Advertising Agencies and Direct Marketing Association.  

**About GroupM**

GroupM has adopted these privacy principles for the website located at [groupm.com](http://groupm.com/). This Privacy Policy applies only to the website on which it appears, and not to any other GroupM website or service.  This Privacy Policy also provides information about activities we undertake across internet websites on behalf of GroupM clients.

We continually evaluate innovative ways to protect online user privacy while also seeking to deliver relevant advertising and custom online experiences on behalf of our clients.  GroupM provides services for its clients such as media planning and buying, marketing communications planning, campaign analytics and research, paid search placement and search engine optimization, branded entertainment as well as sports sponsorships (“Services”).

**WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**Information You Provide Us Through Your Correspondence on this Website**

It is extremely rare that we collect personal information. However, in the instance we do, the personal information we collect comes directly from our Site visitors. We collect personal information from our visitors in the following situations:

  * When you submit inquiries through our “contact us” link on this website,
  * When a visitor signs up to receive our marketing emails or newsletters,
  * To submit information in connection with an employment inquiry,
  * When a visitor expressly enters information into a text field or otherwise submits information to us.



We keep a record of the information you provide including your email address and any other Personally Identifying Information, (“PII”), you provide, solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or request. PII includes name, address, telephone number, email address, or any other data used or intended to be used to contact specific person.

We automatically receive Non-Personal Information (“Non-PII”) when you visit our Site. Non-PII is any information where on its own cannot be used to identify, contact, or precisely locate a particular individual. Non-PII includes  your IP address (in the US), browser information, information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, the date and time of your visit, and the web page you have visited immediately prior to visiting this Site, and more.

Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, this information will never be shared with third parties without your consent. GroupM may pass your PII to our subsidiaries and affiliated companies so that they may contact you in connection with your inquiry. PII passed on to a subsidiary or affiliate of GroupM in another country will receive protections in accordance with GroupM policies and local law. By using our Site you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules and regulations than in your country.

GroupM may provide you with the ability to purchase or subscribe to certain services on the GroupM website for a fee.  In such event, we will collect certain PII from you, including payment information, solely for the purpose of processing your purchase or subscription.  In connection with such purchase or subscription, we may share your PII and payment information with our affiliates or vendors to the extent necessary to process your payment and deliver to you the products or services you have purchased.

If you would like us to remove your information from our marketing e-mails or newsletters, unsubscribe you from our database, or if you would like to change or correct any of your information, please contact us at [privacy@groupm.com](mailto:privacy@groupm.com).  Be sure to include your name, email address, and clear instructions regarding any changes you are requesting.

**Information We Collect Through our Services**

We do not collect PII from users online through advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients unless, in the rare instance, users affirmatively and deliberately choose to release that information by submitting it, in a text field for example. We do collect Non-PII to identify devices that we have interacted with before through advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients. For instance, by using Non-PII, we may be able to identify a device that has previously seen an advertisement we launched on behalf of a client. Devices include computers, mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, or other digital devices capable of maintaining an internet connection.  

**HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION**

**Use of information for Services**

As stated above, we may collect Non-PII regarding your web browsing, usage or interactions with advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients.  Through the collection and use of Non-PII, we offer a range of Services to allow advertisers to show you the most useful and relevant online advertisements across numerous websites and to prevent excessive or repeated deliveries of the same advertisements. We do this to better customize the sort of advertisements you see on various websites and for other purposes such as research and analysis.   For example, if we infer that a user is interested in apparel options, then our Services may help our clients deliver interest-based online advertisements to you about a particular type of apparel. You can learn more about such advertising practices by visiting [www.iab.net/privacymatters](http://www.iab.net/privacymatters).

**Disclosures for Europe**

Please note – in Europe, an IP address is considered PII by applicable law.  If we conduct business in such countries and we know that you are located in such a country, we will treat your IP address as PII.

In such countries we interpose a “black box” which is operated by an independent third party and which separates the user’s IP address from other data we collect. If your browser does not accept cookies or if the opt-out-cookie is set, no tracking takes place.

targ.ad is a service of ours which places a cookie on your computer for the purpose of interest-based marketing as described above.  This service is primarily used Europe.  The service has been certified with the Data Privacy Seal issued by the Independent Data Protection Authority of the Federal State Schleswig-Holstein in Germany in March 2010.  You may opt-out of the targ.ad 2.0 cookie by clicking here

**COOKIES & SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES**

GroupM may use cookies to tailor your experience on the Site, and to help provide a better service to you.  By using the Site you are consenting to our use of cookies. If you do not agree to our use of cookies, you should set your browser settings accordingly, or not use this Site. You may opt out of cookies used on our Site below in the “out-out” section.

We collect Non-PII through the use of cookies, pixels and related technologies.    A **cookie** is a file on your browser that uniquely identifies your browser and computer. Cookies make personalization of your web experience possible, and may allow sites to record your browsing activities to remember your site preferences. Other cookies may be placed on your browser by third party companies to help deliver the ads you see online. These cookies will help serve ads to you based on your interests.   **Pixels** and **Web Beacons** are lines of code which is used by a website or third party to assign online activities to a computer or browser.  The use of a pixel, for example, allows websites and us to record that a user has visited a particular web page.  Additional Non-PII from an earlier interaction may be included in the pixel.  

We use technology, including cookies, in the delivery of our Services.  We believe that the use of these tools enables us and our advertiser clients to provide users with a more meaningful web experience by serving you with more tailored information to facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site during each browser session.

Both session and persistent cookies may be used in connection with the Site. We use Google Analytics to help us analyze how visitors use the Site. Among other things, Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information about the number of visitors to the Site, the webpage that referred visitors to the Site, and the pages that visitors view within the Site. The Google Analytics cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser; this type of cookie is known as a “persistent” cookie.

**Cookie Opt-out**

Though Non-PII does not personally identify anyone, we are still committed to giving users the opportunity to exercise choice about the Non-PII we collect.   Click here to Opt out of receiving Cookies from the Site. For more information visit [www.aboutad.info/choices](http://www.aboutad.info/choices). and [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

In addition, at any time, you may adjust your computer’s web browser settings to refuse all cookies. However, by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the websites you visit or take full advantage of all the website offerings and interest-based advertising.  You can remove cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.

You may also choose to opt out of GroupM collecting Non-PII in connection with the advertisements we manage on behalf of our clients.  Of course, doing this means that you would no longer receive customized advertisements delivered through our GroupM proprietary technology.

Despite opting-out of our customized advertisements by following the process above, you may still receive tailored advertisements as a result of Non-PII collected (using cookies) by other parties not affiliated with, or controlled by us.  To opt-out of Non-PII collection for tailored online advertising from numerous other providers, you can visit the [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) to learn more and to make choices accordingly.

Our opt-out cookies are programmed to expire 10 years after they are initially issued. However, if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change web browsers or take any action which results in the deletion of this "opt out" cookie, you will need to perform this opt-out process again.  In order for the opt-out to take effect, your browser must be set to accept third party cookies.

**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

We do not collect PII via our client’s advertisements, and therefore, we do not sell, rent, or share PII collected on our or other websites to non-affiliated third parties.  If you affirmatively and deliberately provide PII via one of our client’s advertisements, which will be identified to you as an advertisement at the time of collection, then that PII will be provided to such client, and such PII shall be subject to that client’s privacy policy.

We may disclose Non-PII collected through our Services, and information derived from it, to our clients and vendors.  This Non-PII may be used by our clients to deliver tailored ads to users on participating websites and for other purposes as described above.  This information does not include any PII that can be used to contact or identify any person individually.  Further, we encourage our clients, as applicable, to use any Non-PII they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to publish privacy policies that tell you about how the information they are gathering is being used.  We urge you to always read the privacy policies of the websites you visit to understand issues relating to your online privacy.

We may disclose a user’s Non-PII to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. In addition, and if permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose and provide access to a user’s PII and Non-PII to our vendors and contractors who are performing services on our behalf. However, such vendors and contractors are not permitted to use such user information for any purpose other than providing services to us.

**Data Retention & Storage**

We may use our anonymous cookie information for advertising purposes for up to 13 months.  Aggregate reports generated from this information may be kept longer.

Our Website and databases are maintained in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany.

**Information Security**

We follow industry standards to protect against the unauthorized access to, retention of, and disclosure of information.  This includes undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and management activities required to protect information integrity, access, and use.  Any information that is stored on our server is treated as confidential information.  Please keep in mind, however, that despite these reasonable efforts to protect information on our servers, no method of transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to protect your information at all times, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Change to this Privacy Policy**  

We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time by providing advance notice on our website, when possible, prior to implementing any material changes.  Accordingly, we want to help you clearly understand our Privacy Policy, and any revisions, as such, we encourage you to review our Privacy Policy periodically to become aware of any changes that may have occurred. Please refer to the “last updated” date at the top of this page to see when this policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Site. Your use of the Site following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.

**Children's Privacy**

We are sensitive to the issue of children's privacy.  Therefore, our website and Services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children under the age of thirteen (13). We request that children not provide personal information through the Site.  If you believe your child has provided us with PII, and you would like to have the information removed, please contact us at [privacy@groupm.com](mailto:privacy@groupm.com). Likewise, if we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our records.

**Linking to Other Websites**

A link from our own website to another website does not imply our endorsement, or endorsement of our affiliates, of that website.  We do not control the websites to which we link and assume no responsibility for their content or privacy policies.  Once you link to another website the GroupM Privacy Policy does not apply. Therefore, we recommend you carefully review the privacy policies that apply to any websites you access from our Site. 

**Transfer of Data upon Change of Control**

In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets of our business through a consolidation, merger, asset purchase, or other transaction, we reserve the right to transfer all information (including any PII a user may have provided through the “contact us” page) that is in our possession or under our control to such acquiring party.
