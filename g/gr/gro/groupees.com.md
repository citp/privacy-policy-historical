YAWMA LLC PRIVACY POLICY FOR GROUPEES
Last Updated: September 10, 2011
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how your personal information is collected, used, and
disclosed by YAWMA LLC (“YAWMA”) with respect to your use of the Groupees website,
located at www.groupees.net (the "Site"). We reserve the right to change the provisions of this
Policy at any time. We will alert you to these changes by indicating the date that the Policy was
last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you
understand how any personal information you provide will be used.
What Is Personal Information?
As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an
individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit
card or other account number), or information about that individual that is directly linked to
personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include "aggregate"
information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of
products, services, or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has
been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate
information.
What Personal Information Do We Collect?
We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Site. We collect certain
information you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you register for an account, make a
purchase, send us an email, or provide or request information. Such information may include
personal information, such as your name, user name, email address, mailing address, credit or
debit card info and PayPal account information. We may also collect your purchase history and
other contact and demographic information you provide to us.
When you visit our Site, some information is also automatically collected. For example, we log
information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, address
of a referring website, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal
information if we combine it with, or link it to, any of the identifying information mentioned
above. Otherwise, it is used only in the aggregate.
We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" or web
beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among
other things, cookies help us improve our Site and your experience. If we link cookies to any
personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information. If you
wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn
about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect
certain features on our Site. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on
the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on
the Site.
We may store and process personal information in the United States and other countries.
How Do We Use the Personal Information We Collect?
We use personal information collected through our Site for purposes described in this Policy or
disclosed to you on our Site or in connection with our services. For example, we may use
personal information we collect:


•      to administer our business activities and make our Site and Services available to you and
prospective members;
•      to process orders, product ratings, and recommendations;
•      to respond to your requests, comments, and questions and provide customer service;
•      to provide and deliver products and services and to send you related information, including
confirmations, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative
messages;
•      to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products, or services we think
will be of interest to you;
•      to analyze trends and personalize and improve Site content, features, and the user
experience;
•      to notify you about important changes to our Site or Services;
•      to process and deliver gift certificates, contest entries, and prizes; and
•      for the purposes for which the information was collected.
What Personal Information Do We Share With Third Parties?
We will not share the Personal Information we collect from you through this Site with third
parties, except as described in this Policy or on the Site. Because the promotions that are run on
Groupees are the promotions of the Artists, Developers, Authors and other Content Owners
whose products are featured during the sale promotions (the “Partners”), the Partners themselves
are provided full access to Personal Information of individuals who purchase products during the
Partner’s specific Groupee promotion, excepting specific financial information such as credit card
information, Paypal accounts and the like.
In addition, you should understand that information you post in recommendations, profiles, public
or private groups, or other interactive areas of the Site or services will be available to other users
and in some cases may be publicly available. We recommend you be cautious about giving out
personal information to others or sharing personal information in public or private online forums.
We are not responsible for the actions of any third parties with whom you share personal
information.
We may also disclose information to third party social networks at your direction, e.g. when you
"tweet" or "like" something on the Service.
We may also disclose personal information in the good faith belief that such disclosure is legally
required or is reasonably necessary or appropriate (i) to comply with laws or to respond to lawful
requests and legal process, or (ii) to protect the rights, property, and safety of YAWMA, our
employees, agents, members, and the public, including to respond to claims, enforce our
agreements, policies, and Terms of Use and protect YAWMA and our members from fraudulent,
abusive, inappropriate, or unlawful use of the Site or Services. Personal information may also be
disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets,
financing or acquisition or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred
as one of the business assets of YAWMA.
We may also share personal information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers
("Service Providers") who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of
the Site or services we provide and who need access to such information to carry out their work
for us. For example, in some cases, the Service Provider may be directly collecting information
from you on our behalf. We may also share personal information with other third parties when


you give us your consent to do so. We are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or
other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to
these Service Providers or other third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their
practices before disclosing information directly to them. Nothing herein restricts the sharing of
aggregated or anonymized information, which may be shared with third parties without your
consent.
Do We Link To Other Web Sites?
Our Site may contain links to other websites. Any personal information you provide on the linked
pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. We
are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of websites to
which we link. Links from our website to third parties or to other sites are provided for your
convenience. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies
before providing them with personal information.
What Steps Do We Take To Protect Your Information Online?
YAWMA takes reasonable measures to protect your personal information in an effort to prevent
loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
What Choices Do You Have Regarding the Use of Your Information?
You may "opt out" of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us by following the
instructions in those emails. You may also send requests about your contact preferences and
changes to your information by emailing support@groupees.net. If you opt out, we may still send
you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your account, products and service-related
issues.
How Can You Correct and Update Your Personal Information or Obtain Additional
Information?
If you have any questions about this Policy or the practices relating to this Site or our services, or
you wish to verify, correct, or delete any personal information we have collected, please contact
us at support@groupees.net. However, please note that in some cases, we may believe it is
necessary or appropriate to retain certain personal information we have collected, and the deletion
of such personal information will be in our sole discretion unless otherwise required by law.
