<br>
While browsing our site you may see several opportunities to subscribe
to our product announcement group, to join this we require you to provide your e-mail address. We use this address to notify you of new software releases, updates and special offers. For your convenience, each announcement contains instructions on how to be removed from all future mailings. We do not make your e-mail address available to any third parties.&nbsp;Please

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><b>3. During Software Purchase.</b>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 It 
      is important to note that Infacta does not process orders directly. We 
      use reputable&nbsp; ecommerce companies to do this on our behalf using 
      the very latest in secure transmission technologies. It is very important 
      for these companies to keep accurate purchase records. Immediately after you purchase one of our products our 
      ecommerce partner will notify us and will pass your contact information 
      (e.g. name, company name, postal address, email address, telephone and fax&nbsp;number)&nbsp;together
with&nbsp;some limited purchase order&nbsp;information (e.g. purchase date, order reference number, product code, product 
name, quantity, price and any delivery options).&nbsp; This data is used
to enable us to email you with necessary product unlock
codes, to identify you in order to give you the full benefits of
your purchase including free technical support and upgrade eligibility and to
enable us to set up a user account providing you with access&nbsp;to our customer resources area.&nbsp;&nbsp;For security purposes
the ip address of this transaction may be recorded.&nbsp;
Please note that we do not receive a copy of your actual payment details (such
as credit card numbers or wire transfer details). We do not make
any of this information available to any third parties. To learn more about our
ecommerce vendors and their privacy &amp; security policies, go to their respective web sites:&nbsp;<br>

The area of the site governed by this policy does not 
      use "cookies"&nbsp;(which are small pieces of information that your

      anonymous <em>session cookies.&nbsp; </em>A session cookie only ever

      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">     
             The customer resources area presents a 
      highly individualised facility for managing&nbsp;downloads and updates.&nbsp; In order 
      to provide this facility we have to record basic 
      (non-financial) information about each user's choice of purchase as well 
      as recording their usage of the facility, for 
      example to customise the downloads remaining for each 
      user.</font></p>

        To protect the customer resources area from misuse we actively 
      monitor all&nbsp;logins into the system in addition to recording standard web 
      logs.&nbsp; We collect login dates and times as well as recording 
      IP addresses on an individual basis.&nbsp; In addition, we 
      record details on&nbsp;all downloads that are taken, also on an 
      individual basis.&nbsp; This allows us to perform individual analysis of patterns of&nbsp;activity 
      for the purposes of detecting prohibited access and misuse of the resources&nbsp;in 
      the system.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Support facilities 
      are provided to assist users who may have problems logging in.&nbsp; 
      This may involve the user emailing to us their contact and original 
      order information in order to provide proof of purchase.&nbsp; While this 
      information is usually discarded once the request has been fulfilled, it may be 
      retained indefinitely in special circumstances&nbsp;where it might prove useful&nbsp;to&nbsp;compile&nbsp;a past history 
      of such requests, for example if we suspect 
      that a user is attempting to gain&nbsp;access 
fraudulently.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To expedite&nbsp;the handling of 
      priority support emails we may record computer and browser 
      information.&nbsp; This allows us to quickly deal with common problems 
      arising from incompatible system settings, for example if we detect that 
      a user's browser does not support cookies.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Customers may provide suggestions

      revisit the site.&nbsp; An optional third permanent cookie is used to 
      implement the "Remember this Account" function and this cookie contains 
      your email address.&nbsp; A fourth temporary authentication cookie is used
