      &nbsp;<p>Last Updated 09/23/2005 </p>
      <p>At Growthink, we recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we 
      design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in 
      mind. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we 
      gather when you use Growthink's website, as well as some of the steps we 
      take to safeguard it. </p>
      <p>The following principles apply to the personally identifying 
      information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying 
      information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your 
      name, physical address or email address. </p>
      <p>Data collection </p>
      <p>Some of our services and/or information requests require you to 
      register for an account and/or provide personal information. Growthink 
      will use that information to provide the service or fulfill the 
      information you requested. </p>
      <p>Cookies </p>
      <p>Upon your first visit to Growthink, a cookie may be sent to your 
      computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" is a small file 
      containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you 
      visit a website. We sometimes use cookies to improve the quality of our 
      service and to better understand how people interact with us. Growthink 
      does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user 
      trends and patterns of how people search. Most browsers are initially set 
      up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or 
      to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Growthink features 
      or services may not function properly without cookies. </p>
      <p>Information sharing </p>
      <p>We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to other 
      companies or individuals, unless we have your consent. We may share such 
      information in any of the following limited circumstances: </p>
      <p>-We have your consent. </p>
      <p>-We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the 
      sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on our 
      behalf. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those 
      parties to process such information only on our instructions and in 
      compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and 
      security measures. </p>
      <p>-We conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith belief 
      that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably 
      necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Growthink, its 
      users or the public. </p>
      <p>If you have an account, we may share the information submitted under 
      your account among all of our services in order to provide you with a 
      seamless experience and to improve the quality of our services. We will 
      not disclose your account information to other people or non-affiliated 
      companies, except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy or 
      with your consent. </p>
      <p>We may store and process personal information collected on our site in 
      the United States or any other country in which Growthink, Inc. or its 
      agents maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to the 
      transfer of your information among these facilities, including those 
      located outside your country. </p>
      <p>In the event of a transfer of ownership of Growthink, Inc., such as 
      acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice 
      before any personally identifying information is transferred and becomes 
      subject to a different privacy policy. </p>
      <p>We may share aggregated information with others. </p>
      <p>Information security </p>
      <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized 
      access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
      </p>
      <p>We restrict access to your personally identifying information to 
      employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop 
      or improve our services. </p>
      <p>Updating your information </p>
      <p>We provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your personally 
      identifying information for many of our services. If you have any problems 
      updating your information, please contact us at updates@growthink.com. </p>
      <p>Links </p>
      <p>Growthink’s site includes links to other websites that might be useful 
      to our visitors. These websites are developed by people over whom 
      Growthink exercises no control. These other sites may place their own 
      cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information.
      </p>
      <p>Changes to this Policy </p>
      <p>Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We 
      expect most such changes to be minor, but there may be changes that are 
      more significant. Regardless, we will post those changes on this page and, 
      if the changes are significant, we will also provide a more prominent 
      notice. Each version will be noted at the top of the page. </p>
      <p>If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact us 
      any time at privacy@growthink.com. </p>
