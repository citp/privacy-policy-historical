Effective Date: July 18, 2017

This privacy policy explains how xAd, Inc. dba GroundTruth (“we,” “us,” “our”) and our affiliates and subsidiaries collect, use, and share information via our mobile advertising service and mobile advertising landing pages (“Services”).

## Overview of GroundTruth’s Services

GroundTruth is a mobile advertising platform specializing in location powered mobile ads. Our Services combine data, technology, and strategy to help advertisers reach the audiences most likely to be interested in their products or services.

If you visit the mobile website or use a mobile application of one of our platform members, that property will have its own privacy policy and practices. You will need to refer to the member’s privacy policy for information about their data collection and use practices.

GroundTruth adheres to the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”)](http://www.aboutads.info/principles) self-regulatory principles, the [Digital Advertising Alliance Canada’s (“DAAC”)](http://youradchoices.ca/) self-regulatory principles, the Internet Advertising Bureau (“IAB”) UK’s Good Practise Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“EDAA”) self-regulatory principles.

#### Data Collection & Use

We may collect various types of information from mobile devices using cookies, scripts, web beacons, software development kits (“SDK”), or other similar techniques. These technologies are used to collect digital actions of users that visit and use mobile websites and applications, or interact with ads presented in mobile websites and applications of our platform members. We also receive other data (e.g., demographic information) from third parties or through analytical techniques that we combine with the data we collect or derive through the Services.

The data we collect can include a device identifier, browser and operating system type and version, device type, and other data from or about a mobile device including location related data, as well as information about users’ web viewing and application use. This data may be collected over time across different apps, websites, browsers or devices. We may also receive data related to the location of a mobile device from platform members and other parties. We may also derive physical address information from the location information we receive or collect from mobile devices, such as for the stores and other places the device frequents. We retain data used for interest-based advertising only as long as we have a legitimate business purpose to retain such data, or as otherwise required by applicable law.

We may use data for purposes including analytics; research; reporting; attribution; Service enhancements and other business operations; predicting possible relationships among different browsers and devices; differentiating and/or associating multiple device users as well as associating devices or users with locations such as a household or workplace; frequency capping; and in multiple ways to make ads more relevant. For instance, we may use the location related data to present ads from a local business or use that and other data we collect to deliver ads that the user may find more relevant to their interests. Another example would be using this data to create “segments” – groups of users that are inferred to share similar interests.

#### Choice

We use data collected across different devices and from non-affiliated websites and applications over time to provide advertising relevant to interests inferred from this data for our clients. This form of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. We may also partner with other ad companies to extend our audiences across different browsers and devices for interest-based advertising purposes.

You may download DAA’s AppChoices mobile app, or the TRUSTe mobile app, on your iOS or Android device in order to exercise choice regarding the collection of application use data for interest-based advertising by us and other companies that participate in those choice tools on this device. Links to those applications are below:

  * [DAA AppChoices iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870?mt=8)
  * [DAA AppChoices Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices&hl=en)
  * [TRUSTe mobile app iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=551047372&mt=8)
  * [TRUSTe mobile app Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.truste.mobile.consumer&hl=en)



If you would like to exercise choice regarding our, and for other third parties that participate in the DAA Choice Page, collection of web viewing data from web browsers for interest-based advertising purposes on this device, click [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

When you make your choices on your browser or device using these choice tools, we will stop using data from that browser or device for interest-based advertising on it. We will also stop using data collected from that browser or device on other browsers or devices associated with it, and will stop using data collected from those associated browsers or devices for interest-based advertising on the opted-out browser or device. For iOS and Android users, to limit use of precise location data for use in interest-based advertising, you can turn location services off through your device settings.

Note that electing to opt out from GroundTruth services will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or device, erase cookies from your browser, or reset your platform ad identifier, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. In addition, we may still collect data in browsers or apps for non-interest based advertising purposes such as for analytics and reporting purposes, operations, improving our services and frequency capping.

#### Data Sharing

We may share various types of information we collect and infer about devices and users with our affiliates, third party partners and agents for advertisement targeting, audience extension across different browsers and device, to make and create offers, for other marketing purposes, to provide reporting to advertisers and clients, to improve our systems and products, and for other research and analytical purposes.

We may also share data with third-party contractors and service providers who work on behalf of us. We may disclose data in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights and obligations or defend against legal claims. We may also transfer data in the event of an acquisition or merger with another company, including at bankruptcy.

#### California Residents

If you are a California resident, you can ask us not to share personal information with non-affiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes by emailing us at [privacy@groundtruth.com](mailto:privacy@groundtruth.com).
