## Ad Platform Privacy Policy

[](https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/validation?rid=f302f577-1bf9-492f-973f-3a38ed7119a2) [](https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/validation?rid=b4671d1c-59d8-41c7-97d3-26fb71c7391e)

Effective Date: December 30, 2019

This privacy policy explains how xAd, Inc. dba GroundTruth (“we,” “us,” “our”) and our affiliates and subsidiaries collect, use, and share information via our mobile advertising service and mobile advertising landing pages (“Services”).

* * *

## Overview of GroundTruth’s Services

GroundTruth is a mobile advertising platform specializing in location powered mobile ads. Our Services combine data, technology, and strategy to help advertisers reach the audiences most likely to be interested in their products or services.

If you visit the mobile website or use a mobile application of one of our platform members, that property will have its own privacy policy and practices. You will need to refer to the member’s privacy policy for information about their data collection and use practices.

GroundTruth adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) self-regulatory principles, the Digital Advertising Alliance Canada’s (“DAAC”) self-regulatory principles, the Internet Advertising Bureau (“IAB”) UK’s Good Practise Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“EDAA”) self-regulatory principles.

### Data Collection & Use

We may collect various types of information from mobile devices using cookies, scripts, web beacons, software development kits (“SDK”), or other similar techniques. These technologies are used to collect digital actions of users that visit and use mobile websites and applications, or interact with ads presented in mobile websites and applications of our platform members. We also receive other data (e.g., demographic information) from third parties or through analytical techniques that we combine with the data we collect or derive through the Services.

The categories of data we collect may include:

  * Digital identifiers, such as device identifiers and IP addresses;
  * Information about the browser and operating system type and version, device type, and other data from or about a mobile device;
  * Precise geolocation data;
  * Postal addresses; and
  * Information about users’ web viewing and application usage activity, including what advertisements are interacted with.



We may collect this data from a variety of sources, including over time across different mobile apps, websites, browsers or devices. We may also receive data related to the location of a mobile device from our platform members and other parties, such as consumer data resellers. We may also receive physical address information from our customers or other third parties, or we may derive address information from other location information we receive or collect from mobile devices.

We may use any of the data we collect and receive for a variety of business purposes including analytics; auditing; research; reporting; attribution; detecting security incidents and illegal, deceptive, or fraudulent activity; service enhancements and other business operations; predicting possible relationships among different browsers and devices; differentiating and/or associating multiple device users as well as associating devices or users with locations such as a household or workplace; frequency capping and other auditing purposes; and in multiple ways to make ads more relevant, such as by inferring potential interests based on web viewing and application use activity for advertising purposes.

For instance, we may use location data for proximity or audience advertising. Proximity advertising uses location and other data to present ads based on a device’s current location. Another example would be using location and other data to create “audiences” – groups of devices that are inferred to share similar interests or other characteristics based on the information we collect – to deliver ads that we believe may be more relevant to those audiences. We consider both proximity and audience advertising to be interest-based advertising as described in this policy. We retain data used for interest-based advertising only as long as we have a legitimate business purpose to retain such data, or as otherwise required by applicable law.  


### Choice

We use data collected across different devices and from non-affiliated websites and applications over time as well as other data described in this policy to provide advertising on behalf of our clients that is relevant to a device’s location and/or interests inferred from this data. This form of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. We may also partner with other ad companies to extend our audiences across different browsers and devices for interest-based advertising purposes.

You may download the DAA’s AppChoices mobile app, or the TRUSTe mobile app, on your iOS or Android device in order to exercise choice regarding the collection of mobile application use activity for interest-based advertising on this device by us and other companies that participate in those choice tools. Links to those applications are below:

  * [DAA AppChoices iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870?mt=8)
  * [DAA AppChoices Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices&hl=en)
  * [TRUSTe mobile app iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=551047372&mt=8)
  * [TRUSTe mobile app Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.truste.mobile.consumer&hl=en)



Location Data Choice: The DAA’s AppChoices tool can also be used to exercise choice regarding the collection and use of precise location data by GroundTruth for interest-based advertising purposes. iOS and Android users can limit our collection of precise location data from a device by turning location services off through the settings on that device.

If you would like to exercise choice regarding our, and for other third parties that participate in the DAA Choice Page, collection of web viewing data from web browsers for interest-based advertising purposes on this device, [_click here_](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

When you make your choices on your browser or device using these choice tools, we will stop collecting and using data from that browser or device for interest-based advertising on it. We will also stop using data collected from that browser or device on other browsers or devices associated with it, and will stop using data collected from those associated browsers, devices, or elsewhere for interest-based advertising on the opted-out browser or device.

Note that electing to opt out from GroundTruth services will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or device, erase cookies from your browser, or reset your platform ad identifier, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. In addition, we may still collect data in browsers or apps for non-interest based advertising purposes such as for analytics and reporting purposes, operations, improving our services and frequency capping.

### Data Sharing

We may share the various types of information we collect and infer about devices and users with our affiliates, third party partners and agents for advertisement targeting, audience extension across different browsers and devices, to make and create offers, for other marketing and advertising purposes, to provide reporting to advertisers and clients, to improve our systems and products, and for other research and analytical purposes.

We may also share data with contractors and service providers who work on our behalf. We may disclose data in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights and obligations or defend against legal claims. We may also transfer data in the event of an acquisition or merger with another company, including at bankruptcy.

### Children

Our services are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.
