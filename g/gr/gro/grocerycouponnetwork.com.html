Cookies are files that Your web browser places on Your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to help save and retrieve passwords used on the Website and to save information on past activities and other preferences. Where cookies are used, You do not have to re-enter log-in information every time that You visit the Website. When You visit the Website, our servers read the cookie to help target and personalize Offers to You. For example, the cookie can help ensure that You do not see an Offer that You have already completed.  Cookies also let Grocery Coupon Network know if We have repeat visitors. We also use cookies to identify which websites Our repeat visitors are coming from. GroceryCouponNetwork does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about You from Your computer unless such information was knowingly and willingly provided by You. Grocery Coupon Network respects Your privacy and Grocery Coupon Network’s cookies are not linked to any personal information. Grocery Coupon Network works with third-parties to serve ads on the Website. These ads may contain cookies and/or action tags (also known as single pixel gifs) to measure advertising effectiveness and gather completely anonymous information. We have no access to or control over these cookies or action tags.</p><p>You are always free to decline these cookies if Your browser permits, however You may not be able to use certain features on the Website and You may be asked to re-enter Your user ID and password more frequently during Your sessions on the Website.</p><p><strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p><p>We have security measures in place designed to protect the security of Your information. All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. In addition when You submit Your credit card information or other sensitive information, the 128-bit encrypted Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) connection scrambles or encrypts Your information before it is sent to Us over the Internet. This protects Your credit card information from being read while it is transferred. SSL is supported by Netscape 2.0+, Microsoft IE 3.0+ and most frame-enabled browsers. Depending on which browser You use, You will know that You are in a secure area by "https" or a small key or padlock in the bottom right hand corner of Your browser indicating that Your transaction is secure. Unfortunately, no security measures can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect Your Personal Information and sensitive information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that You transmit to us, and You do so at Your own risk. Once we receive Your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.  Access to Personal Information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public.  All Personal Information is restricted in our offices.  Only employees that need the Personal Information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to Personal Information.  Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all Personal Information.  Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action.  In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify You and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to Your Personal Information.  You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach.  Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p><p>DO THESE SAME PRIVACY POLICIES APPLY TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES THAT YOU ACCESS THROUGH THE GROCERY COUPON NETWORK WEBSITE?</p><p>No. The Privacy Policy appearing on the Website relates only to Grocery Coupon Network. You will notice that the Website may contain links to other websites, such as websites operated by Our Sponsors. We cannot be responsible for, and shall have no liability in connection with, the privacy and security practices of other websites that You may access through the Website, even if links to those third party websites are displayed within a frame on Our Website. You should always review a particular website's privacy and security policies when visiting that website and before revealing any Personal Information to that website.</p><p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</strong></p><p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time in our sole and absolute discretion by posting a notice at the Website explaining that We are changing Our Privacy Policy.  The user's continued participation in the Program and/or continued receipt of GroceryCouponNetwork e-mails constitutes an affirmative acknowledgement and acceptance by the user of the modified Privacy Policy.
