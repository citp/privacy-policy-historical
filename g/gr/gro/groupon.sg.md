 **1\. Protecting You**  
The Groupon website www.groupon.sg is owned and operated by Beeconomic Singapore Pte Ltd (t/a Groupon Singapore). Beeconomic Singapore Pte Ltd("Groupon Singapore", "we," "us," "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable data protection laws in the SG).

Please note that use of the Website by you is subject to this privacy policy (the "Policy") and the Website’s [terms and conditions](http://www.groupon.sg/terms_and_conditions) of use ("Terms and Conditions"). Where this Policy uses a word starting with a capital letter, that term will be defined in the Terms and Conditions or elsewhere in this Policy.

Our Policy explains what information we collect on the Website, how we use and/or share this information, and how such information is maintained. By using this Website, you signify your acceptance of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, in whole or part, you should not use this Website.

We may also collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer this Website. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.

We may ask for your e-mail address during your use of the Website.
